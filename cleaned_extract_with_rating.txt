Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without any doubt.
-----
This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Good:

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
- Received next day by 11 AM !

Not So Good:

- Not that thin, but ok.
- Doesn't have Samsung Dex
- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.
- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)
- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.

Feedback

- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.
- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.

Go for it without any doubt.

Dear Amazon &amp; samsung you have broke my trust, Lot of noise in images while capturing photos in low light.
Rear Camera getting blur in low light.

False ads, poor camera quality, inefficient battery management
-----
Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.
Cons:
1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.

2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.

3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day "return" policy to 10 day "replacement" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.

Pros:
1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.

2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.

3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

Inferior quality and built
-----
I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.

64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.

Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.

Face unlock very slow.

Heat issue which charging and heavy usage

Full charge takes more than 3 hrs

Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone
go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality

The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.

Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.

However my only concern is "dust" and how it came there if its brand new.
So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.

Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.
-----
A fab phone at this price!
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play &amp; Lenovo K8 Note.
2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.
3. PROS.
(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek &amp; stylish to look at.
(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.
(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.
(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.
(e) With quad camera &amp; a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.
(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.
(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.
4. CONS.
(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.
(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.
5. I'm satisfied with the phone &amp; the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  &amp; brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. üëç

Faulty selfie camera, video playback lagging no money back
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product. Amazon has agreed post diagnosis saying its a faulty piece  but does not give refund

My Real Review - M31 is Average
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Hi
I am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.
Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.

1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.
2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.
3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.
4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.
5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.
6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.
I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.

Thanks.

Not satisfied with the quality
Display quality is no adequate
Body is made of plastic like material
I was using MI like 6 plus pro then 7 plus pro
For a change I have purchased this product, the quality is not up to the mark when comparing to my old redmi note series
I have requested for refund but as Amazon policy they refused for refund
Not value for money

Little overpriced. Not very ergonomic. Bad sound, defective piece.
-----
3.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Cons:
Button position (power&amp; volume) too high
Fingerprint reader too high
Heats up a lot.
Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.
A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.
A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours &amp; 28 minutes
Speaker volume low.
The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.

Pros:
Feels lightweight
Nice display.
The camera is decent.

Update 1:
Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.

Update 2:
Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.

Update 3:
Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit.

One of worst mobile and one of the worst brand. Better to purchase any other brand except Samsung.
1. Heating issue
2. Second sim works on 3g.
3. Even its 6Gb ram works like 2gb ram phone.

When I called amazon customer care they said I have to go to service center for this and they are telling to check through app.

Its a f***ing phone please please please don't waste your money.

And this is my last ever purchase from amazon.

1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around.
2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point.
3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network.
 wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone.
bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance.

I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day.  Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting  sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes.
 I expect this might be  software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.
Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me.

This is a duffer phone &amp; not a smartphone
-----
2.0 out of 5 stars

I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!
I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!
I so miss my POCO

First the pros
1. The brand name - if you think it is one!
2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant
3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos
4. Build - seems decent

Cons:
1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying
2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today
3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable üò≠. What kinda innovation is this
4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app tooüò¨. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device
5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device
6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic
7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emailsüò≠. Believe me, I have tried all settings
8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps üòÇü§£. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking
9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.

The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates me

Anyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me now

What a waste of Money this has been

Lot of heating issues, Picture quality is dam bad, Battery not at all look like 6000 MAH, it is hardly 3000 MAH. Taking 4 hrs to full charge and draining like any thing. No match to the technology from Chinese Products like OPPO,LENOVO and Realme. Way behind compared to chinese products. Humble request to all, not to buy this product...

Received it on time within 24 hours thumps up to amazon. Now Product. Done all the settings. I am using samsung after a long gap of 8-10 years. After Samsung Grand I had stopped using. So setting done now data transfer Samsung's smart switch option is fantastic. Everything I wanted to transfer got it. No problem at all .Now SIM transferred. Done OK it is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card. Effortless working.
Now Camera. It has got lot of options. All I have not yet tried but for sure I have checked the quality of the photograph and the night mode is superb. What else you want to know rest of the things are written in detail and is true. Working very fine. Proud to won it. Nice Product. Samsung should keep competing iPhone

Don't buy

2.0 out of 5 stars

Cons:
1. RAM. Claims to be 6GB, whereas my 2year old phone with 4GB RAM has much smoother display
2. Battery Charging. Claims 15W fast charging. Takes more than 2 hours to charge the phone.

Pros:
1. Good cameras
2. Perfect screen size

I bought it as a great deal from Samsung, but it is a BIG dissappointment. And they say it cannot be returned. Total waste of money for me. Redmi Note pro 8 is much better than this at same price.

Over am not that super satisfied..
Pros
# Good LiveFocus camera, Shallow DoF is excellent
# sAmoled Display is great
# Good features

Cons
# Slow-motion video sucks goes dark
# Macro lens has lot of distortion
# Charging sucks needs 2.5hrs to get full charge, 6000mah is good but discharges 1.5day for normal usage.
# Slight heat while charging..
# 9 out of 10 times doesn't recognise your face during low light, figer print reader is also slippary
# Poor mobile &amp; Wifi Signal scanning
# Phone is slippary in hand use protective case always.

Over all I didn't get the feel I expected for this price range..

Worst mobile was I got , Samsung m31 taking more time for charging 100% , it's almost 4 hours for charging , and after that 20 hours battery I'll train 0% its waste of time compare to other fast charging mobile , and camera worst

Ok product for the price range
-----
3.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.

Pros:
1. Display: Trust me it‚Äôs amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.
2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.
3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.

Cons:
1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.
2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.
3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.
4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn‚Äôt work even after adding alternate looks.

Verdict: You can buy this if you don‚Äôt like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.

It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display &amp; mammoth battery.
Pros :
1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )
2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.
3. SAR rating - lowest one
4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )

Cons :
1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print &amp; dust magnet )
2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great
3. Not so great processor

Who can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming &amp; not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery &amp; Samsung branding.

Review after a week of usage

4.0 out of 5 stars

I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and cons
Pros:
1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.
2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)
3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAM
Cons:
1. Front Camera is not as good as expected
2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ‚≠êÔ∏è)
3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex

Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ‚Çπ59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.
------------------------------------------------------
Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.
Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.

Very poor performance.. camera is ok not bad . But very slow net speed .. opening app time is relatively fast but after internet is very slow .... my old mobile Samsung on max is much faster performance for loading web page than Samsung m31 .. this phone taking much more time to open any web site ... remaining everything is ok ..
Fast changing is not far like they said .. 30 mins charging it charging 20% but my old Samsung is 30% charged at same time . I have found this two major drawback.

First... I would like to express my experience of this mobile is tooooooo worst.... It's never performed like 6GB Ram Mobile.... It's working like 512kb ram ram mobile. And another great backdrop is it's bluetooth... It's connectivity does not meets at atleast basic phone... And another thing is it's speaker...This one also very poor.... Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst...
I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms.
Finally, my dear all who want to buy this product i strongly recommend that don't buy this mobile and don't waste your money...

Camara quality is too bad

1.0 out of 5 stars

Camara is too bad. Sound clarity is not at all good ... though it looks like a premium phone ,but when you started using it makes you feel that you bought a cheap quality product. Gets frequently stuck and restarts for no reason.
-----
DONT PURCHASE this M31.

Apart from battrey and screen nothing is good. Front facing camera as per specs is of 32mp. But when u go for high resolution it show 21MP... TOTALLY CRAP. My samsung j7's 8mp is FAR MORE BETTER THAN this one in terms of front camera. FRAUD BY SAMSUNG.
Finger prnt reader is not able to detect most of the times.

BAD CAMARA, VERY SLOW CHARGING, NOT IMPRESSIVE  DESIGN. NOT RECOMMENDED.
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this.

Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara.

During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendly

The most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......

Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.

Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme.. I trusted Samsung  but eventually  it didn't  fulfilled  my expectations.

Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it

Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.
After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.
Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons üòú). Think before buying this phone.

Amazing. Bang for Buck. 5/5.

A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.

Good phone in this price

The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screen
If you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colors
I am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few days
Camera pictures are good
Lots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually
-----
Disappointing 64MP Camera!!!!
-----
3.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Camera is not as expected. Its garunteed not 64MP the way it takes pictures. Ofcourse the colors in the pictures are awesome however, if we try to zoom even slightly it doesnt show clearly. Night mode is also not as expected it gives blurr images. I am disappointed with the camera as camera was the sole reason I took this phone. Front camera is as usual with full of beauty effects which I hate. Otherwise, speaking about its other features such as battery, looks and feel, Display, etc it is pretty well with this price. Although the plastic feels kinda cheap but its ok.

For Battery &amp; Performance - 5 STAR , for UI - 3 STAR

hi,
I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm.
On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good.

Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall.

However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.

Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.
1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc
2. LED flash for incoming calls
3. Reminders &amp; Goals missing in Calendar
4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc
5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting. Seems like it needs high lighting
-----
Best spec mobile with lowest SAR value under 15k.
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels).
Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones.
Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardware

Finally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands.
Infact my first samsung phone.
While configuration, received security patch and UI updates
From user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands.
Since the frameless case in yet to be delivered, using it very carefully
Super happy user since 3days. No complaints or regret on buying the phone.

Disappointed  with Samsung, after many year I decided  to back to Samsung but  truly disappointed. Worst part of Amazon policy now you can't return at alll moreover not even replace easily,  you need to install the app then you will surprise  all the problems you face shall be found ok in the software. You will be in difficult to face the situation. My strong recommendation not to go with Samsung M31.

LOVE TO SAMSUNG M31 "MEGA MONSTER"
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Samsung M31 is the best ever mobile I found till now with "6000 mAh" monster battery, superb "64 MP Quad Camera", sAMOLED Amazing display, 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM, very quick fingerprint reader and many more. I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents or videos as we required. As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.

1.Camera - 3.8/5
2.Performance - 3.0/5
3.Battery backup - 2.7/5
(Battery doesnot prove itself as 6000mah)
Charge time is quiq agreed.But,drains fast.Feels like the capacity is 4000mah.
My reivew im submitting after a week of observed usage.
My major point on selecting this mobile was battery.........They assured 6000mah but the fact is i can just get 4000mah worthfullness.
If ur just looking for 6000mah battery mobile this is the worst choice.
Badly feel like cheated by samsung.

Review after 2 days of use
Screen - 2 good..animations and transition very good, I won't miss hype around 90hz refresh rate
Samsung OS- one UI 2.0 is good but I personally don't like the home screen, using Lawnchair launcher for home screen and dock...Like other features of OneUI2.0
Games- Cant say, I dont use mobile for gaming
Battery- charged only once til now, so far so good
Camera- Love live focus by samsung..Boehner is applied to all faces in pic, daylight pics and Videos are awesome, yet to test night mode
Camera after 10days- indoor and low light is below average and a let down by Samsung.
This is my first Samsung Smartphone and I am glad I bought it

Opinion after 10 days- reducing rating to 3stars
-----
Disappointing 6000 mah battery &amp; performance, but good amoled display.
-----
3.0 out of 5 stars
-----
(After 10 days usage)
The only advantage is AMOLED display.

Performance of this phone is not at par.
Battery is also disappointing as far as 6000 MAH is given, it only last a whole day.
I was using 3500 mah phone earlier and that almost lasted same. Than 6000 mah should last too much longer than that, it's not optimised.

Phone also gets heated sometimes even in normal usage (no games)

Also build of the quality is not as standard for this range. It looks ok but actually cheap. The plastics make sounds when you feel it by fingers.

I did not find it fast enough for 6 GB RAM.
Processor is slow. CALL DIALING, and normal features also run slow on this phone.
Camera is also not very good.

To sum it up, camera, battery ,performance is not up to standards and disappointing and only good id amoled display.

Poor camera and display quality. Its not a 64 MP camera it's  quality is like 8 MP camera. Flash is not working in 64 MP ratio.And Amazon is also not returning this item. Vivo gives more quality in this price range. Now a days Samsung is selling it's name only not quality. Don't buy this.

Hi all - whoever planning to buy M31 please don't its having a serious display issue showing lite pink and when we rotating less then 1 inch in any dimension its showing exact color otherwise direct view showing pink ..half showing one color half display in another color. They are not taking return for this product. Used Samsung before but now thinking never to buy anymore. I want return or replacement from amazon

Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products

Well designed OS with Android 10. With Ui2.
Nice and good popup notification.as well as access this popup directly as a second screen.

Good cameras. Four cameras including of 64Mega pixels. Giving amazing performance.
Amoled display giveing different view for all applications as well as photos.

Connecting with other made very easy with in one or two steps. Like WIFI, TV,and other device's.
Awesome battery. Proofing Mega monster.
Awesome storage also a mega monster.

Well improved security level, face detection.
Notification also customised as different level.

The phone is very amazing it's more than expectation. I ordered black version with 6GB of ram and 128 GB space. Best smartphone in this segment price. The trump card  of this phone is camera. What a wide angle and selfie  captured by this phone amazingly good..  all the best feature you will get on this price.
-----
Great buy. Excellent camera and battery for this price.

I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.
My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.
The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.
Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.
So here are the pros and cons
PROS:
- Price
- Camera
- Battery
- Display
- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.

CONS:
- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.
- Charging could be faster

Final thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.

As per commitment of the samsung about this  this m31 is worth less camera quality is very bad.
Other calling aap not supported.

After 4-5 apps open the phone performance is really slow.
Charging of the phone is really slow it takes 3 hours to full charge.. samsung cheated us.

Purchased Samsung M31 on sale date and got delivered the very next day. As soon as i opened  the box i was disappointed  as there is no Screen protector or Mobile case available. Box has only mobile phone , type c cable and charger only. Phone was charged to 73%.
Now , i have been using it for past few days and i have mixed reviews about it.Display of this phone is very good and one can easily differentiate between anyother company and samung's super Amoled.Camera seems to be okayish.. it's  not that great but UI of samsung is very smooth.Batterylife is also decent compared to 6000mah.
My opinion is it will be a decent buy for 15k but dont expect too much from it.

It's really amazing product...smooth operations...huge battery backup...premium look....feel is superb..... (first 5 days)

But
Camera quality expectations are fully embarasing. Camera wise it makes mood off.

I waited for this handset, purchased after long wait....performance is superb..but quality of camera is so so....

One more problem noticed-
Hangs too much,
Can't shut off,can't reboot,
Voice calling hanged,
No voice during calls, just mute..
Slowwwwww,
It shows UI error..

Totally disappointed...

Requested for refund/replace...waiting for good one.

An underappreciated budget phone
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
There are lots of negative review which led me to confusion before buying this, but this phone is worth the price.
Display- awesome, colors , touch rsponse...all good.
Battery- long backup, even if u play games. Around 14 hrs display time (medium usage)
Charging - a bit slow, takes 2 hrs from 25 to 100
Camera- good color production,  decent picture quality (not a sony sensor, so don't expect that quality), macro is nice. Selfie (both angle) decent. Overall for day to day usage it's very good. But not for pro shooters.
Processor- thought it would be the biggest drawback, but it is not, pubg and asphault runs well in smooth(not hdr)

Overall i will recommend this phone to all who use phone for day to day usage(no hardcore gaming but big games with casual setting will run well), love to support made in india products.
Thank you.

I don't know this issue for all M31 devices or only my device. Camera quality is very very very bad.. If you do little zoom, you can see black lines are coming and going..If you record video, more than 30 minutes..getting message "camera not responding message"...Not happy with the audio

Battery life and fast charging is opposite to what company promises
-----
1. Camera is not up to the expectation
2. Battery doesn't seem to be 6000 Mah it hardly last 1 day further takes 2.5 to 3 hrs to get fully charged worried if this is huge battery life and fast charging, what will be the normal one from Samsung.

Hope the company have test check the features, if not kindly do it to get the correct facts.

Other brands which are way smaller than the samsung brand offer better performance.
-----
2.0 out of 5 stars

Best in class, but with a few exceptions
-----
Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.

This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:

First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.

Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.

Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.

If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?

This is an average phone just with battery backup only  and not great w r to speed and performance
-----
I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.

Pros:
------
&gt;&gt; no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.
&gt;&gt; Good battery backup
&gt;&gt; Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.

Cons:
------
&gt;&gt; Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.
&gt;&gt; we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.
&gt;&gt; This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.
&gt;&gt; This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).
&gt;&gt; Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!
&gt;&gt; The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.
&gt;&gt; This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.
&gt;&gt; The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.
&gt;&gt; My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.

Conclusion:
-------------
An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.

Camera(VIDEO STABILIZATION dosent work) , battery are good . Phone heats up a little bit but that heating is acceptable .

Screen is not as good as Nokia screens and others (IPS LCD ) , IPS LCD would have given a better performance .

Screen doesn't give Natural colours.

Performance is good . Fingerprint sensor is awsome , it works very Smoothly .

The software has better options .

Mirror link is not supported by this mobile . If they had provided Mirror screen option then it would have been great ,no 3rd party app supports mirror link .

Charging cable is too short .

Camera is not as good as Nokia 8.1 ,6 .

If the mobile gets IPS LCD SCREEN , SONY IMX CAMERA then the mobile would be so awesome

I was using Samsung J2 earlier,  excellent phone,  later shifted to moto X4....after long time switching again to Samsung after hearing the success of M30s. Little disappointed. It's an average mobile phone.
1.The finish of the phone is below average. If we use this mobile without back cover,  please will judge that this guy is using cheap Mobile,  I am covering it up with spigen cover now. It is not even like Samsung J2 mobile. Poor plastic.(ABS).
2. CAMERA,  I use to take lot of mobile photographs  it's my hobby,  I don't see any difference in this megapixel and 3 or 4 camera's....if you are better cameraman, single camera is enough,  since it is with 4 camera we try to take different pictures,  camera okay. Lot of night in low light. Macro is 5 MP, no clear picture....
3. Reception of Mobil signal, I felt slightly weak,  when I compare with motoX4, I was using it for nearly 2 years, now with M31s, I am not getting proper data connectivity inside home. Further I have to check...
4. Mobile phone is mobile slightly heating up, not like mi,  but it is not like earlier Samsung.
5. Battery it mega but last for one complete day, there is ko need to search charger in the evening,  but we need to charge it in the night, the charging time is long since the battery 6000mah. There will be possibilities of partial charging of battery, which may reduce the life of battery.
Samsung could have done better, looks like urgently cooked...
Can we replace with M30s?...

Good replacement for J series in this price tag
-----
Fair review after one week of usage:
Pros: 1. The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.
2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.
3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.
4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.
5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.
6. Battery life is quite very good.
7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.
8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.
9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.
Cons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn‚Äôt expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.
2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.
3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.
4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.
5. The charging is a bit slow.
6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn‚Äôt expected with this processor and android version.
7. The sound output could have been more.
8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.
9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.
The phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage. Though its the best phone in all the lower range series of samsung.

Only Indian sim card labeled phone. Don't buy if you want to use outside India.
-----
Received my Samsung Galaxy M31 on 7th Mar. It cost me 15,999 rupees.

Literally shocked to see the Indian sim card only labeled on box.

Immediately called Amazon customer and their response is pathetic. They said they cannot write everything about product.

Product description is based on what features they want to show to customer. As it is a electronic item so there is no return possible, only replacement option is available if there is any fault in the product and cannot do anything more.

They are not ready to accept the fact that they are hiding such a important information that this phone cannot be used outside India.

Learnt my lesson and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in future.

They are only good enough for groceries and small items.

Fullon value  for money  .

Awesome  screen .
Awesome battery  .
Awesome  cameras .
Specially  ... one UI 2.0 of Samsung  is superb. I used Samsung  Galaxy  alot but for 2-3yrs i was on moto and others ... but being  back to Samsung ... it's  worth it .

Go for it ... the screen is just min blowing  at this price . No one can beat it .

Also .. I don't  play any games ... but i read alot and watch plenty of movies ...but being  an experienced  smartphone  user i can tell ... it can run any game without  lag .. with 6 gb + exynos 9611 processors (if I'm  ri8) . Same as A51 which cost 24k .

Just go for it .

1 thing is plastic body ... but body is also very good ... not like previous  plastic  Samsung  ... it's  glossy ... but any way we are gonna use back case  ... so it doesn't matter  anyway .

1 thing - Biometric  take some time to get use to i guess.

It's  a large device ... side fingerprint  would have been best .
And face unlock  take some time ..... face unlock is not that good i would say . But may be due to extra security  .. we have to make sure of correct  angle and light  .

Branded alternative for Redmi phones at this price range
-----
Pros:
1. Display is good especially dark images or videos look great
2. Really a monstrous battery
3. Selfie camera is better
4. Fingerprint sensor is fast
5. OS is fluidic without any lag
6. Call quality and reception is good
7. No ads and the default Apps can be deleted

Neutral:
1. External speaker volume is decent but not great. Would be great if they provide stereo speakers like in the Nokias

Cons:
1. Primary Camera is decent but not great. 64 MP is just a number on paper. My 16 MP LG V20 camera takes better photos.
2. Phone is little heavy

Conclusion:
If you don't want Redmi Note series phones then this is the best branded alternative at this price point

SORRY AMAZON AND SAMSUNG.
-----
Sorry but this time Amazon and Samsung really disappointed me.
I have bought samsung m30 and m30 S earlier from Amazon and it was really a Goood great deal. But this time it was very disappointing and shameful. I bought m31 megamonster for my soulmate but she really got disappointed with phone and it was really hurting for me.

Poor camera quality like a 2 megapixel camera
Not 64mp
Poor battery like 3500mAh not 6000mAh

DON'T BUY M31 U CAN GO FOR M30S. SORRY SAMSUNG

Falsely advertised device!
-----
I feel cheated. This phone sucks. Battery lasts less than my 4000 mah battery. The "64mp" camera shows more blurriness and pixels than my redmi note 7 pro which has 48mp camera.

The phone's screen also looks kinda cheap although performs well, the build quality of the device is far bellow standards. Extremely disappointed. Beware. This phone has many PAID reviews that speak highly about this device.

Very good product for the price...
-----
The Amazon tamper proof packaging &amp; timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.
The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.
After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.
I like the look &amp; feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.
Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front &amp; rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.
For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).
In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.

Good Phone at 16k with a massive battery.
-----
It's an upgrade to the M30s. The screen is good with a raindrop camera. The Super Amoled display is quite good to use even while at outdoors.
The massive 6000 mah battery easily gives backup upto 1.5 days on moderate to heavy usage.
It takes around 2 hours 40 mins to 3 hours on initial charging from zero to 100 percent.
For Gamers there a Game Booster App.

The camera is also quite good with lots of options to choose from.

Cons:
The phone has some bloatwares, some from samsung, and some third party like Helo app. Some apps like fb can only be disabled.

Overall a Good Phone, and the massive 6000mah battery is really good for moderate to heavy users.

Weak signal antenna...Flash and wide angle camera don't work with 64MP camera..battery performance don't look like 6000mh. Both front and rear camera quality is bad...making false advertisement on camera and battery performance...don't think you are getting quality features in Rs.16000..if you buy it you are big fool..

Awesome buy !! So far so good !! Heavy Duty Battery. Top specs at a reasonable price.
-----
I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.
This phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.

Now coming to the phone :

Pros :-
1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.
2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.
3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.
4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.
5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.
6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.
Other conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.

Now coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :
1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.
2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.
3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.

Overall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)

Very poor quality, phone touch stopped responding on few areas suddenly. Didn't expected this from Samsung. I am not able to use from a month.. :(
Tried connecting customer service and they asked to go service center when it opens after lockdown. On asking whether my warranty period would be extended due to this, they completely denied.. I am feeling cheated now. :((
Don't buy this phone !!

BAAP of Power and features

5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I bought this phone as soon as it was launched, a month ago after my Galaxy S10 was stolen. I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.
What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.
So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.

Worth for every penny
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars

Let‚Äôs start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.

Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.

Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review

The Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.

Galaxy M31

That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.

In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.

Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review

Galaxy M31

The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.

Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.

Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review

Galaxy M31

The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.

On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company‚Äôs custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.

First time I plugged in for charging. Phone displayed recovery mode screen though I haven't pressed any button. Totally disappointed by this experience.
I have requested to return this item and refund me entire amount but amazon policy relaxed upto replacement.
Bad experience.

Display and look wise phone looks stunning but still I haven't used it so system performance might be well as expected. I hope so.

Waiting for brand new replacement of M31. I hope it would work well

Great phone! Highly recommended.

Good phone in mid range. Though the plastic back takes away the premium feel of using samsung brand. Function wise it's good. But looks wise the company could do better using glass or metal.

Fingerprint reader is accurate and so is face recognition.

Battery is powerful and long lasting. Keeps you going all day!

Camera quality is awesome and comes with many cool features also! Pictures and videos are sharp and true to their color and high quality.

Overall, it comes with many features and the brand Samsung adds to the value and trustworthiness of this phone!! Using it for three months now. Smooth and perfect.

PA: no proper cover available. I wish samsung provided it.even if for extra cost with high quality for protection.

Couldn't find any till date. Help me if someone has recommendations.:(

Superb Budget Phone by Samsung

4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.

*Camera:

Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.
Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.

* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.

* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:
--&gt; Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)
--&gt; 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming
--&gt; 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)
Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.

* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.

* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.

* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.

* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).

* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...
--&gt; Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)
--&gt; Personally love the Dark Mode.

Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.

Wonderful phone for this budget. People talk about lot of specs in the phones like xiaomi  and poco in this price range. But Samsung has all that and longevity as well. Samsung phones don't die on you.
The camera setup on this phone is wonderful, the detailing it captures, the colors, the selfies  every thing is perfect.
The huge 6000mah battery, just wow. It will easily last for 2 days if not more. Even with high youtubeing and social networking it will last for 2 days.
Signal receiving strength is excellent and to add to that it has wifi-calling option as well.
Speakers are good, but real deal is listening the music through head phones, it supports Dolby atmos.
The rear mounted finger print sensor is at the right place and super fast.
The 6.4 inch AMOLED screen is next level. Its Samsung so you can't expect nothing less.
With 6 GB RAM the multi tasking is really good.
Overall wonderful phone with very decent pricing and its Samsung.  It can't get any better than this in this price range.
So go for it and this phone will definitely surprise you.

Proud to own a "Made in India" handset
-----
It's been only a few days of purchase.  So far the experience is good. My usage is minimal for basic emails, social media chats, picture sharing etc. Very less usage for voice/video calls as well. No gaming. Battery seems to last three days easily on one full charge.
What makes me proud to own this device is that in all the years I have owned a cell phone, this is the first time I am holding a "Made in India" device. Proud of that . Will post an update later based on future experience

Worth the price but features are a failure
-----
I am a tech guy and this review is genuine. First of all Samsung is the baap of mobiles..coming to m31 I waited so long to buy and saw many reviews.lets start from positive..
1. Camera is awesome both front and back. Picture clarity in zoom is good
2. Very smooth finish of mobile which looks really great
3. Touch is better than other mobiles compared to Oppo or MI
Coming to negative points
all reviews almost fake regarding battery...they just really bluffed..6000 mah battery is not even coming for 2 full days..I used data for around 18 hrs but still it got drained fast.
When charged the mobile it taking around 4 hrs to get complete charge from 0 to 100 percentage  but mobile is getting heated a lot..didn't expect this from Samsung at all.
Loud speaker is not so efficient.
Normal sound is good
As its SAMOLED the picture or video quality is good..eyes r not strained

Mixed feelings
-----
I purchased this mobile based on previous Samsung galaxy mobile experience. Now i've mixed feelings on it.

These are my observations after single day use.

1. Rear camera quality is extraordinary unless you zoom it.
2. Front camera isn't that great. Beauty mode is always on and photos are patchy.
3. Samsung KNOX isn't preinstalled. So, you can't use "Secure Folder". Need to install "S Secure" app for app lock.
4. Guesture screenshot didn't work.
5. Phone is slightly heated while updating and installing apps.
6. OS is so smooth.
7. Fingerprint reader unlocks the mobile swiftly.

Update: after multiple days of regular use
1. So far battery lasts almost 2 days with regular usage. Like YouTube, Facebook and etc.,
2. Though it's of 6GB ram, I noticed lag and phone stuck frequently.
3. Front cam needs a lot of improvement
4. Call quality isn't that great
5. You can hear full voice only when tye voulme is completely up or almost full. Same applies to earphones as well.

Verdict: Go with this mobile if you're expecting a good rear camera and better battery performance.

Irresistable, stable, able n affordable! S31

I have been purchasing Samsung M series phones for self and family for years now and never regretted my choices. The M30s for my FiL and this lovely M31 for myself are both excellent phones at a very very competitive price. With the lastest Android 10 OS and access to both Google and Galaxy playstores, an incredible Amoled screen with excellent touch sensitivity etc., this is a beautiful choice. With a monster battery, even without aggressive conservation settings, you get good milage. The new USB connector is a joy, with the option of high power charging for those urgencies when traveling.. backed by Amazon's super logistics and accessories options, this is a great buy!

Awesome Phone - Vegu Sirappu (Tamil)
-----
Good things are
1.Awesome cameras, both front and rear (a shot using macro mode is attached)
2.Excellent processing speed
3.Battery withstands more than 30 hours ( all time mobile data enabled, camera was used many times, normal WhatsApp usage but I never play video games).
4. Wonderful display experience (far better than my previous (Galaxy on next)
5. Low SAR value (0.38 W/kg as per manual) and No heating issues during the above mentioned usage.
6. Highly comfortable UI to use the phone
7. Face recognition is good (can't find fault)
8. All the features are really good and high end configuration under Rs. 15000
9. I feel Very comfortable to have this phone and it is really worthy

Improvements required are
1. Call volume is little less and loud speaker volume also littleless (I don't have any hearing issues)
2. It takes more than a hour to fully charge But it may be acceptable because of 6000 mAh Battery.
3. Samsung should have sold this good phone with headphone. So, without headphone I feel this sale is incomplete

Overall highly satisfied with the phone
-----
Received the phone 10 days back. After a long gap I am back to Samsung Brand and I must say the phone is awesome almost in all departments. The performance of 6GB/128 GB handset is definitely above the mark, ergonomically designed phone fits into the palm well , hence its a pleasure to hold the phone. The camera quality is good, ease of using, navigation is extremely user friendly and the  finger print sensor is good, not yet explored face recognition feature. Most of the important apps are pre installed hence its again a plus point and more importantly Microsoft tools are re preinstalled, Just one draw back which I  found in the phone as of now is the app lock facility is not available need to install a separate app from the play store, this should have given as a preinstalled feature.My verdict is go for the phone its an awesome piece not from china so that's another satisfaction of holding this handset.

Not worth it..
-----
I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!

Good product by Samsung.
-----
Best smartphone in this budget.
It has 4 rear camera with 64 mp main features.
Selfies had good impressions due to 32 mp front camera. No need to press buttons for selfy.
Very smooth display.
Sound quality ok.
But in headphones very good quality.
Only one issue is NFC connectivity is not available.
Rest every thing super.

Happy with my choice

It's really good device. Battery is a freaking beast, amoled display is beautiful and UI is very slick and simple. I got nothing to complaint considering what I paid for it. I would never buy crappy Xiaomi phones with its obscene notifications. Go for samsung phones, they don't push anything vulgar with their phones.

Need some camera improvements by update
-----
I brought this phone because of camera and battery. Battery is fine but i expected more from camera the details of camera is poor when you zoom the image even 4x digital and optical. Recently i broughted m30s 2 weeks ago and it has some issues so i returned it and i am telling you there is no major upgrade on rare 64mp camera mode. It's almost look like m30s 48mp photos. I watched many youtubers saying this is the best camera with this price but i think it needs importants because when i zoom in after taking a image its details are gone its look like 2mp image. But i think Samsung can fix this problem with software upgrade and overall this phone is good and also I don't know why they bother giving a macro camera , it's pathetic it's can't get too close and the details are pathetic link 0.5 mp . And if samsung fix this issue with update i will update my review.

The WORST phone you can get in this range, front camera pics quality is so worst that it looks like an oil paint job with all smudged, NO SHARPNESS at all. The curve of display is so round it doesn't even  feel like a rounded rectangle, it's an OVAL. EVERTHING IS PLASTIC, The software processing, image processing, performance processing  is just bad, no its WORST. The game booster which is provided doesn't  seems like its boosting anything than consumption of battery. A LOT OF HEAT IS GENERATED in usage of 1 hour even while doing normal tasks.
In conclusion, even if someone  is giving  this SAMSUNG M31 for free DON'T BUY IT.  M31 is just a hoax of a specs and nothing more, the worst of all. This was my first samsung phone, gone with the brand's name and it's simply disappointing,
NEVER GONNA BUY ANOTHER  SAMSUNG PRODUCT
Now with this AMAZON POLICY OF NOT REFUNDING, feels like the most regrettable decision of the year, feels like mental torture spending 17K for this M31. SIMPLY WORST. Seriously  need my money back, NEED REFUND for this product, WORST PRODUCT in every aspect.

Overrated and Hyped
-----
2.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Battery life is better than my previous phone which was a 4000MAh. I am yet to rigorously test it through gaming and continuous wifi or data being on.

Camera on the front does a horrible job. Shame on Samsung that they name it a 32Mp camera. The back camera does a decent job but not upto the expectation of a quad camera set with 64Mp.

RAM is pretty good and I feel the phone has no lag and it doesn't hang.

Speaker voice quality is average and could be  better.

The body is extremely disappointing as it's a fingerprint magnet and Samsung doesn't give you a back cover at least.

Facial recognition takes a lot of time

Conclusion: can't expect any better than this on the price range.
However, samsung and Amazon have blown the hype out of proportion especially when they know that business value is lesser when competing with the likes of Xiaomi or Vivo or Realme

This phone is a winner. Absolutely stunning camera @64 MP. Excellent battery life, still running after extensive excitement use by my daughter. Biometric scans both face and fingerprint work well. Video quality is excellent
Awesome cost.

The only drawback Galaxy store works well, the play store doesn‚Äôt.

I purchased Samsung NEW on the very day of its launch. Got delivery next day. Actually it arrived before estimated time.
This I have been using the phone for about one week now. It's a fantastic phone.
1. Design, slimness, weight is very impressive.
2. Display sAMOLED is simply superb. Color production stunning.
3. I have purchased M30s also a few months ago. M31's display is even better than M30s.
4. Battery lasts for about 2 days on usual use time. I have Samsung On Max also. Which I have to charge twice a day. But NEW easily runs for 2 days.
5. Camera is also very good, both rear and front. I have taken some night photos without using flash. They, beautifully captured the subjects with clear details. Front camera is equally good.
6. It's lighter than M30s (which is also having 6000mah battery).
7. Phone doesn't get heated up much even on continuous use.
8. One good feature Samsung has added is caller identity. It detects spams automatically. No need to install Truecaller.
9. It also has QR Code scanner. This is very helpful.
Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price range. I am fully satisfied having purchased this phone

Brought M31 128 gb variant . Phone looks great and display really nice. But battery  life is not seems to be like 6000mah . For simple usage YouTube videos,online songs- battery drains fast  .  I was using lg w30 as temporary mobile (3000mah)I feel that mobile backup was good.

After some day will update my comments if any changes

Ultimate Smartphone under 17K
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Moved from a Moto G5s Plus to Samsung .
Pros :
1. S-amoled display is just fluid , smooth and oh ghosh the deep blacks and the punchy colors . Undoubtedly the best display under 17K .
2. 6000mah battery easily lasts for a day and half with heavy usage like 2hrs of Pubg , lots of social media stuff , photographs . The POWER MODE especially is phenomenal .
3. 64Mp Camera is a beast when it comes to details but the 16MP ( pixel binning ) auto mode is the best where this device shines as the HDR and algorithms by samsung are just so perfect . No image over processing nothing . The Ultra Wide is the best as said by many top reviewers and it has distortion correction as well where as the Macro camera captures details and quality as it's a 5MP shooter .
4. Exynos 9611 well its brilliant . Don't go for the benchmarks . Performance is superb bcz of the optimization . No lags and stutters . PUBG plays at HD and High frame rates by default and plays smoothly as well . That was a surprise to me also bcz I never thought of exynos handling games so good .
5. The phone is not too heavy and looks pretty good overally and the Dolby atmos has its own magic when you're connected to bluetooth or wired headphones .
6. The fingerprint scanner and the face unlock are supremely fast unlocks within a second and the Samsung UI over android 10 makes this phone the best midranger out there .

Cons :

1. The speakers of the phone naturally reduce while playing PUBG but it's not the case in playing other games .
2. The back of the phone is plastic and thus it's a fingerprint magnet genuinely. Do buy a back cover for avoiding scratches.

Screen also ok but not so much clear as explained ,scrach marks easily can be noticed if it comes it touch with rough surface.

Overall average product ...not matching with samsung brand name .

Great for camera freaks and exhaustive users ( extended battery life)

Its been 10 days since i have started using the phone. There are certain things i'd like to mention.

Pros: great camera, you get the best pictures even in dim light (YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH REALME PICTURES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT USE FILTERS, IT GIVES HIGH QUALITY PICTURES, IF U NEED BEAUTIFICATION THEN THE FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE IN CAMERA SETTINGS), finger print reader is upto the mark, screen is very handy, it has got some great inbuilt features, speakers are good for one room echo,face detection is also one great feature in it. Battery  is one great perk. I charge it once in 1.5 days.

Cons: hangs a lot while transferring file to another phone,occationally malfunctions and restarts without command, follows command with a little delay at some point, as compared to my MI A1 i find this phone a little not upto the mark in terms of performance. Super slow in charging. It looks like it takes for ever to charge.

Apart from the camera i dont think it has anything super good to discuss. Its like a regular phone that one can buy.
 We as youngsters  are more obsessed with the camera thing and battery life, hence this phone is everything in terms of those. I haven't played games on it and hence i dont know how will that be.
I am rating it 5 beacuse the cons i mentioned are temporary, it does not affect over all performance. I am satisfied i keep downloading files, use microsoft office on it, play youtube,click pictures and little stuffs so it works fine for me.

5.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung Galaxy M31 gives you a very high value for the price. Given my price range and the features I was looking for, it was hands-down the best smartphone in the market right now.
At this price range, Samsung offers a lot of features in this smartphone that the other brands have not. For example -  AMOLED SCREEN, An enormous 6000 mAh battery and also a 64-megapixel quad-camera!!!
This phone makes watching movies a pleasure due to the AMOLED screen for immersive viewing experience and the Dolby Sound as a cherry on the cake.
I also, do recommend this product for novice photographers.
Conclusion: I am freaking loving this smartphone

Not so good phone after use

I have noticed below issues with phone.
* camera: it cuts photo frame in ouput photo due to this u do not get actual image of what seen on screen, it cut about a inch from sides.
* battery: takes tooooo long to charge if phone is made on charging at 20% than it takes 3 hours to reach in nineties that too if no other work is done and phone is kept idle.
Also battery drains out easily
* Heating issue: phone is getting hot at charging time, regular use of data. And not only back screen too gets hot considerably.
While video calling pop up comes that whatsapp is making phone hot, close whatsapp otherwise will close in 20 sec.

A beast by its value for money

Battery life is great as it easily lasts for over 48 hrs of usage in single charge. Vibrant colours - probably the best and refreshing colour combinations (especially in the dark mode) for menus and adaptive colour and brightness settings are top notch. Smart and smooth UI is simple to use and highly responsive, Samsung has added some of the new cool features to the UI which are very useful. Fast processor (I am not a gamer) functions without any lag. Camera quality is Fantastic in good light conditions including the front camera, the picture taken are very close to their natural colours. Overall an excellent value for money. Go for it. Highly recommended.

Touch sensitivity  is Also poor and performanece is also not good

I thoroughly like this mobile.
Very smooth to handle.
The camera is very good in day light and medium to low light.
The battery back up is awesome. It took 40 hours for the mobile battery to go from 100 % to 23 %. In this timeframe I had medium usage of the mobile also I used it with wats app live tracking with GPS on for my cycling trip for 8 hours. Also around 3 hours of Google map use.
Though I cannot comment much on gaming experience as I don't play games on mobile, but just to experience played subway surfers for 10 minutes and it performed good.
Overall a good buy for me as I was searching for a mobile with nice camera and battery.

disappointment ......

I have a good working phone -samsung A8 plus.. still purchased this phone as I  was excited with its features of 64 MP camera and 6000 mAmp battery-- both these features are a huge disappointment in this phone
no differnce from A8+ - or even worse
no back cover/screen guard; purchased them online, before they come and start using this phone -return window expired..
No fast charging as claimed, infact very very slow charging.......

atleast no heating issues like other cheaper brands
screen, touch sensitivity, fast processor -- are good
sound is again a disappointment
slow motion video and live focus on both cameras, both sim Volte enabling  - are the good features

Writing this review after 10 days of usage.
Pros:
1. Samsung's Super AMOLED Screen
2. Massive 6000 mAh battery
3. 64 MP Quad Camera
4. One UI 2.0 based on Android 10 out of the box
5. Dolby Atmos Support
Cons:
1. Exynos 9611 is fair enough to handle the daily work but it's a little old processor, it would be better if it would come with any of the latest ones.
2. Fingerprint sensor is adequately fast but it's a capacitive and back mounted. It would be better if it would have in display one.
3. The phone has a massive 6000 mAh battery and it supports fast charging only upto 15 watt. It would be better if would support 25 watt because it takes quite a time to charge the battery fully.
N.B. I am not a gamer. I haven't done any gaming. You will need to go to YouTube for gaming reviews.

Phone is ok.
Battery is good enough, there only plus point.
Face detection does not work very poor,
OTG is very good, Doc. Files transferred open directly without going through any app.
Keyboard features not good in comparison to Google.
Camera quality is just ok.
Palm screen shot is not good.
Adaptive screen doesn't work.
Phone is slow.
Power on off is missing.
Plastic back cover gets scratched very fast.
Videos plays in 2 steps, one in off volume.
Samsung phones are not good for gear S2 watches, it connects through Samsung galaxy store which which does not show all the faces as In other phones &amp; it also does not show the purchased watch faces.

I can't believe within a month the phone screen started showing lines.

19/05/2020 May Update: Went to the service center in Delhi and the lady and the manager said I'd need to pay if anything is broken. What's the warranty for? I asked what's the "Gorilla Glass" for if it couldn't handle a pocket fall (which is what they said happened)? And their reply, "We are insiders. So we understand these things, there's no such thing as "gorilla vorilla" it's a normal mirror. If it falls and breaks then you'll have to pay for this."

I can't believe Samsung has been making a fool of us all these years. Can anyone else confirm this "insider" info? Meanwhile, the rest of you should keep this in a bank locker.

Excellent product..the specifications of this phone are truly amazing and not just on paper , the performance  of the phone doesn't let you down at any instant. The fingerprint reader is quick to respond and has no delay in unlocking the phone.  The camera is the highlight of this phone which allows users to capture splendid pictures (64MP) I myself have clicked numerous  pictures and haven't  faced any issues with the camera. The battery  life of this phone is more than adequate  for daily usage as well as gaming(performs well while running heavy games also).
 I'm extremely  pleased with the product and would recommend  this phone to anyone  looking for a smooth and hassle free experience.

Indeed an all Rounder - Avoid critical reviews lead by unlearned, Pessimistic users &amp; go for it.

YOU SHOULD KNOW WHY THIS IS SUPER MONSTER. MUST-READ.
Samsung has literally poured premium qualities in this phone.

1)CAMERA - Quad Camera rich quality photos. Even after Zoom, details are very clear &amp; No blurs at all. low light snaps are clear &amp; stunning. Compared to under 20k Chini brands like (Viv/opp/Rme/Rmi) this is unmatchable.

2)SENSORS - All sensors are quick, most importantly they're consistent &amp; reliable (Which indicates its durability, Quality &amp; long-lasting capacity).

3)DISPLAY - Super AMOLED + Full HD = Baap of all displays. Glorifying video experience. Touch Response is quick &amp; so far no single glitch.

4)MUSIC QUALITY - Built-in DOLBY ATMOS technology. You'll experience the distinct Thump of bass. (also depends upon on the quality of your headphones like How much it supports to this technology)

5)CALL QUALITY- Premium mic quality. Crisp &amp; Clear voice calls. Supports almost all CODECS including Aptx

6) RAM - Best RAM management, even after you play heavy graphics games along with complex tasks, you'll see approx 1.5gb still left. That means your phone is breathing easily even in heavy usage. NO HEATING.

7) PROCESSOR - Many Reviewers are misleading on this by comparing snapdragon. but, few this months old Exynos 9611 chipset has mastered with 6GB ram to ensure thriving experience &amp; to perform any task no matter what you doing on your phone. So far No complaint about the performance &amp; during multitasking &amp; Gameplay.

8)GAMEPLAY - Heavy graphics GamePlay like Ark, pubg, Minecraft etc are fluent. So far No frame drop, even in high settings. Recommending to use Built-in Game Booster feature for Thriving Gaming experience along with AMOLED graphics. Just Imagine.

9)BATTERY - 6000mAh juice will give you an output of approx 2 Days on avg use &amp; 1 day(20hrs) on heavy usage.

SUMMARY -  If you looking for a maintenance-free consistent device for 3-4 years then Go for It without hegitation.

Hardware is top notch. The software leaves a bad impression. Especially the galaxy store during setup. It attempted to download and install lot of applications during initial setup. This must be the way the manufacturer tried to subsidize the product i can understand. But it was a nightmare to setup. The one ui is not so great when compared to stock Android and feels spammy.

The Box Contents :
The Phone, Charger(15W), C-Type Charging-cum-usb Cable, Some Related Papers

First Impressions :
The Package was packed well and the Samsung  Box was compact.
The phone has a impresive design and the weight was well distributed.

After a week usuge:
1. Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained  even in bright sunlight  you see the display  pretty  well. The viewing  angles  are also good. No color  changes  when views angles  gets changed. No queries  from my side.

2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla  Glass 3 protection  at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared  to other phones  of this budget  section( of course thanks to massive battery).

3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.

4. Front Camera: Performed  well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed  texture  on the face(just turn off the Beauty  effect) and the one of the main function  is that during  calls, front camera  is used as ambient  light sensor  to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's  all about the habbit  that is to be developed with time.

5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played  musics of high  frequency  and bass, at high sound it losses  it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.
The ear piece sound quality  is exceptionally  great.

6. Rear Cameras:  The design  of Quad Cameras  impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.

The 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice  the overall  quality  of normal 16MP photos  are a bit rich as compared  to 64MP photos as capturing  image in 64MP and rendering  it to 16MP increases  it's  quality.

The Live Focus  is impressive and the blurring  edge of the photos  is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial  lighting.  I am satisfied very well.

The wide camera Performed  pretty  well and got satisfactory  results.

I am bit disappointed  with the Macro Lens that didn't  performed well, however  in multiple  shots I got a good quality  macro photo. But using main camera  for macro photos gives great results.

The LED was pretty  good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally  well.

7. Battery:  Yes the massive  6000mAH battery  is worth  called massive. I got the screen-on period  of 10hours in a single  charge.  On using it in a average way gave me around  30 hours of backup.

8. Performance:  I experienced  buttery smooth  performance in using  it in above average usage.  But I will say that you can get  a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance  as it doesn't  got a gaming  processor.
But in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.

The only visible  difference  between  M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement  of secondary  mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which  is on the right in M30s

As a average user 60Hz display  is okay for me, I didn't  experienced  any frame  drops.

Overall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.

I will reccomend  this product  for average  users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.

Amazing camera and great battery life. Plays games like PUBG without any issues at all, didn't feel excessive heat after half hour play either. 128 GB memory should last for everyone.
Dolby is a great addition.

Before buying this phone, I had some doubt but after using this for almost one month, I am üíØ percent sure to say that, Samsung mid range phones are shit,
Front camera quality is as bad as VGA one,
Rear camera: always struggles to focus on close clicks, this phone has 64 MP camera but even my 16 MP phone camera perform far better, I can share the pics for comparison,
Battery: this phone comes with 6000 battery but works as 4500 battery back up, maximum 12 hours, and the slow charging add more dimerit to it,
Display: good,
Performance: bad, very very bad, I don't know if my phone has some problem or Samsung is just proving it's  legacy of bad performaing mid range phones, this phone starts lagging while opening very normal apps, like WhatsApp, and YouTube, in have to say that m31 is  1.5 second slow in opening any app in comparison with my 4 GB RAM  cell phone.
Design: does not feel sleek and premium in hand due to plastic body, but we could take that bulky design if battery works as expected because it has 6000 mah battery in it, but battery performance of this phone is simply bad.

Sorry Samsung for this critical and negative review, but I have to say that you need to work on your midrange phones as well,

Battery: 10/10
Display: 10/10
Sound: 10/10 (Don't expect stereo effect sound at this price. The Dolby Atmos effect that you get through the earphones is however appreciable.)
Look &amp; Feel: 9/10 (It has a plastic back, but at this price, a plastic back is justifiable).
Camera: 9/10 (I am not a big fan of cellphone camera, but intial impression is 9/10.)
User Experience: 9/10 (The phone does not lag as of 5 days of usage. I have disabled most of the Samsung apps, but still few Samsung apps can't be uninstalled or disabled.)

Best features, Ergonomics: The two best things about the phone are its 6000 mah battery and its weight balance which makes it feel way lighter than its 192 grams. The polycarbonate back means you don't need a case and can use this phone bareback which is nice(just rub down with a damp cloth from time to time to get rid of the fingerprints) A faux leather back would have been better but nothing much to complain about.

 Battery: On the battery front, the performance is exceptional(7.5 hours on lte and medium brightness, and 13 hours on wifi) and if you switch off the phone and charge, it can charge up from 20% in under 2 hours.

 Camera: The camera was really bad out of the box but got a massive upgrade in especially low light images after the February patch. Samsung are likely to further improve the camera with updates. One irritation currently is that you can't use the flash and the wide angle at the same time which makes no sense.

 Performance: Performance is good for day to day tasks especially if you go to the settings and "reduce animations" You can also use ram and cache cleaning apps on the playstore to clean your ram and cache with a single click from time to time.

 Hardware: Gyroscope and compass are there. Samsung used to skimp on these in the past. A macro lens is also available along with the ultrawide. Unfortunately no IR blaster and no zoom lens(depth sensor instead) Also no Samsung Pay or Knox security

Display: The display gets better if you tweak it. Out of the box, you get somewhat warm colors. You can also hide the notch the same way as the M30s(look it up on YouTube) Because it is an amoled screen, this works perfectly and you get an uninterrupted display. Overall good experience

Sound: The sound of the earphone jack is not punchy but there is no distortion or noise either so good for soft music. You can probably improve the output further with a third party equalizer. The single speaker is clear and reasonably loud. No distortion and good for speech. But not punchy or good for playing music(but then that's what Bluetooth speakers are for)

Software: You get Android 10 out of the box. I had heard that some people had trouble with using vpn apps after an Android 10 update but fortunately that's not true. Only software con so far is that a native screen recorder is not a available out of the box(so there may be no way of recording internal audio) Further you can't sideload apps from a third party file explorer. You have to use the built in one. We have to see if it improves with updates. Also you have a screen flash and camera flash feature you can turn on for notifications in the absence of a led notification light

 Who should buy: People who want the sharpest data capture on their camera and the best gaming performance may look elsewhere, but if you want a reliable rom(I have had files corrupted, especially those on the micro sd card on multiple occasions with MIUI especially during updates), top class battery life, good customer service, and a good quality amoled screen with perfect notch hiding, this is a really good phone. The lack of Samsung Pay is annoying and the main reason for cutting a star. Other things like the older processor were already on the table

Good products but improvements is need we didn't expect without cons with in 20k from samsung

To be frank!! I didn't find any usefull thing in M31 but we want to spend the money only for brand the only reason to buy this is for superamloed display finger print reader is slow when we are receiving calls it display after 10sec call reception is also slow samsung  must be concentrate on UI camera is good battery life is excellent but I didn't test how many minutes it will take to charge the full battery
  The worst thing is charger other brands are providing best cable and adapter when we touch the other brand chargers we feel like premium but samsung chargers are worst like 100 rs road side chargers and also back panel attracts the fingers easily samsung should concentrate on lot of improvements in UI
  Apart this the mobile is good one who are not students if you are a student to buy this you are must be a normal users not heavy users

Phone hanging frequently and Internet closing abruptly
-----
3.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Good thing is that I got the phone delivered withing just 4 hours on the launch date in March 2020.

As per suggestion I updated phone immediately

The look and feel is nice. Phone quality is good. Also it has AI features in the camera. E.g I can point the phone camera to Text and it can translate, I can point phone to pics, cars etc, and I can information about it.

Phone charging is good. It has fast charging, but since battery is 6000 mAH, it takes long time to charge, no complaint about it.

However I have experience the phone hanging on the usual applications such as Google Chrome, Internet explorer. The Text box does not open up. I need to close the application and reopen it so that I can type the URL, search criteria of my choice.

Once this phone restarted on its own.

Also I have experienced that the Mobile data turns off automatically and it does not get on even though in the settings the Mobile data is turned on.

Like most of the people I am using Data from JIO which is inserted in SIM1. Today I set the data for SIM 1, no idea how it got selected for SIM2. Please note that I have not opted for Data in the SIM 2 and hence whenever the data from SIM2 is used then heavy charges are applied.

Because of these issues I faced giving 3 stars.

Great

4.0 out of 5 stars

Positives:
Great battery life
Nice screen, thank you amoled
Convenient features, fast connectivity (Bluetooth, wifi)
Has not frozen once. No software issues yet
Negatives:
Face recognition and finger print recognition are iffy.
Front facing camera is not sharp at all. Looks like my 2008 computer built in webcam
Samsung apps that can't be removed. (Why add bloatware that no one uses anyways?)
Plastic body while Redmi has metal bodies at the same price point

Still, a great phone at this price. I keep hearing rumors about how Samsung phones slow down after a few years, I'll see if that's the case and update this review accordingly. But right now, I do recommend buying it.
-----
The best phone in this price segment.
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars

My review after using the phone after 8 days of continuous use as I have ordered it on the day of launch 5th March.

Pros:
1. The battery is humongous. it's 6000 Mah. It will last for at least 2 days for normal use. For extensive use like 12 hrs of video stream then it will last at least 24-30 hours.

2. Exynos 9611 processor comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.

3. It comes with Android 10.0 which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.

4. The camera can capture 4K videos too and the camera quality is really  very good both rear as well as front.

5. It has an impressive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with minimal bezels.

6. It has polycarbonate back which isn‚Äôt as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.

7. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).

8. With 6 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far. 128 GB storage is quite enough.

9. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).

10. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.

Cons:-

1. Night mode isn‚Äôt the best.

2. It supports a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M31 is decent but not rich enough.

3. It doesn't come with earphones.

4. It comes with a 15W type-c charger. It goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours. As per same price rahge competitors they could have given at least 25W or so.

Conclusion:-
If you are looking for a phone with best battery backup, good camera quality, best SAmoled display available in price range and a decent processor to handle day to day use with Samsung brand value.

Regards,
Yash

sir, I  purchased the mobile with much excitement that it would provide a wonderful experience but actually the product is not worth purchasing. After using the phone for 3 to 4 weeks the system asked for an update of the software but as soon as I downloaded the update and installed it. My mobile crashed and I can do nothing on the phone. It is neither getting switched off nor restarted. So what type of help you can provide me in this regard. I will be waiting for your reply as a customer.

It is the best phone for the budget from a brand lik samsung all though there is small flaws lik the main 64mp cam is a wide angle lens which looks a bit odd wit a slight fish eye effect and in low lighting it produces lot of noise but u get good detailing and the colour reproduction is amazing and lastly the processor could hv been even better i feel its not that its bad now but still could hv been better overall i rate an 8/10 for the mobile and s 1 more thing u should be aware of is that it doesn't support Samsung pay and Knox. Thank you for your time in taking time reading my comment hv fun peace ‚úåÔ∏è continuing my review after 3 days of usage i could find that charging time takes almost 2 and half hrs and sometimes 3 even though it supports fast charging upto 3hrs

Good Budget phone

Initially, when I got the phone, I encountered the problem during startup, refer to the attached picture but after getting the technical assistance from the Amazon team, I was able to successfully launch my phone and i am not facing any problem after that.
Pros:
1. The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.
2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.
3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.
4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.

Cons:
1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.
2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.

Overall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.

Best Samsung phone under 20K
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Amoled display very Sharp and vivid.

Battery life excellent ...hardly 30 to 40 percent battery down if you are moderate user and not playing continuous game.
OS is smooth.

CAMERA need to improve , need to check software upgrades but it's not too bad ,only we need to search for better software.

Finger print reader is fast.

Go for 6 GB and 128 GB option so no need to worry about space issue.

9611 samsung equinox processor works well no lagging observed ( i am also using 1st time this processor ...otherwise I prefer SD processor).

Charging require 3 hours to full charge..it is just 15 watts charger but dont worry battery performance is great so hardly need to charge.

Samsung really pack monster under 20k ( Best price offered.)

Best phone offered by Samsung....go for itüëå

NOT for the people who are looking for GREAT Camera...
-----
3.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I will be completely honest about my review after 2 days of ordinary usage...

If you are attracted to this phone because of 64MP camera then wait a minute...my iPhone 5s with 8MP takes better photos than this phone.
I don't know it's hardware or software issue. The software can be fixed with future updates.  Photos are blurry in all kinds of shots.  What is "Macro"?
I don't understand.  It takes completely unfocused blurry pics.
So if you are buying Rs.15000 phone for the camera then NO...

I won't discourage the people who want to buy it for performance. It's fabulous in that department.
6GB RAM really helps anyhow?
I don't know...I find little lag during jumping to multiple apps...
But I am satisfied with the product because Camera is not a priority for me.

Additionally I don't know how many ours should a battery last with 6000mAh with moderate use but for me it lasts for 24hr on average without gaming.

Fingerprint: 4/5
Battery: 4/5
Camera: 1/5
Performance: 3/5

Overall: 3/5.
-----
Only attraction is quad camera!
-----
2.0 out of 5 stars

The mobile is a typical Samsung phone nothing special. The only attraction is quad camera and that too is not good, picture quality is like 8 MP camera. I exchanged my Vivo V9 with it and now i'm regretting it. Vivo V9 was far better than M31. If you are going by smart look and quad camera than i am sure this phone will disappoint you.

This mobile has 6000mah battery but it last only one day.camera is not so good according to it megapixels.fingerprint some times not working but almost good.display and touch is good. The major problem is it's hanging. I am using this phone for last 45 days and it hangs 3 to 4 times and it takes 5 to 10 minutes and some times more to start working after hanging.i have Faith on Samsung but this hanging problem annoying me badly.Samsung needs to improve this issues.All other things are good.

Samsung M31: My usage experience is awesome!

Overall  nice mobile! But charging speed is little bit slow minimum it requires 3 hrs for full charge from 0 to 100% . Except that I can't even find out any issues! No heating problems unlike other mobiles . mobile case is not provided  by Samsung . Camera quality is awesome. Fingerprint sensor speed and  recognition is fine. Minimum 1.5 day you can use this mobile with out any worries about charging even heavy usage. Overall One of the best mobile from Samsung in this price range. So surely I will  recommend this mobile to my friends.

Battery life is very poor.

Battery is very poor. It is draining at a rate of 6% per hour. I didn't expect such a poor product from samsung. Moreover, while charging for even half n hour phone heated up. It restarted by it's own after following troubleshoot procedure also.
-----
Gimmicky battery. 6000mAh is just nonsense, feels like 3000mAh
-----
2.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks and the battery feels like 3000mAh at best.

I have used 5000mAh phones from Asus and Panasonic before and those phone easily gave 1.5 to 2 days usage. With the advertised capacity and with a below average processor this should last longer.

I am an average user mostly on WiFi and rarely uses mobile data. Very difficult to use it on second day without charging.

Charges very slowly and discharges fast. It should have been the other way around.

Performance is average. Try to stay away from Exynos processors if you want a reasonably fast phone. But I knew this before buying, so no complaints here

Camera seems decent, but I rarely takes photos and don't think I have enough knowledge to comment on the camera quality

Fake phone. 32Mp camera. 6000MAH battery. Faulty product
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Very bad product. There are so many issue.
1. Heating during using the phone. Like camera phone calls in 2-5 mins.
2. Poor front camera quality. Like 8 MP camera.
3. Sound is also not good.
4. Taking more than 3 hours to charge full. And 6000mah batter is giving one day backup.full fake.
Totally fake phone by Samsung. Requesting Amazon to don't sell this kind of fake phone. Samsung  are fooling the amezon customer.
Don't buy.
-----
Think twice
-----
3.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Consider Other choices also.

Quality 6.4 AMOLED Display in FHD, that is  very comfortable to hold inspite of the mega battery that lasts more than a full day with really heavy usage.

Screen on time is easily 13-14 hrs after a full charge ,that takes around 2.5 hrs. So no more worries.

Touch sensitivity is very good.speaker volume ,call volume, reception are all adequate.Core UI 2 performs well with android 10 out of box and prompt me to update to latest patch on initial setup.No visible lag in daily use with DDR4 ram and UFS 2.1 memory. Finger print reader is snappy with no delay. Gamers may not find the same level of performance in exynos processor as a snapdragon .

Camera performance is good in the daylight.Night mode not good with little enhancements.Wide lens is OK,macro shots are average.Camera software has lot of options to explore. Video recording comes with EIS.selfie also poor.

Build quality is not OK considering the plastic back while competitors are offering gorilla glass panel.
No notification LED.
Network signal is very poor compared to my old lenova.Think twice before buying since only replacement is offered by Amazon.

Everything is okey except below:

1) Camera is getting blurry when you fully zoom for long distance images. It should not happen if its 64MP and one of its USP
2) Speaker volume is very Low
3) Can not split display while you are already on another app
4) Can not connect internet through WPS
5) Poor in facelock sensor
6) Palm swipe to capture screen shot is not working always.. It should be 100% accurate then only it works..

Rest all superb with this price

I have been using this phone for a while now ... And in lockdown situation this phone has given me good support.

Fingerprint reader works fine and is located at back. But i am using the face recognition. I feel its better . I tried using my photos to unlock the phone .... No luck ... Works only with my face...

Camera quality is good .... From a layman's perspective these are gr8 . From a photographer perspective they are just good. Depth camera gives good bokeh...
Macro camera is good

Battery Life is just amazing ... I use this with all office communication apps and still get more than 2 days out of it ... Seriously i am just way toooo happy with it.

Not happy with below:

Phone is a little heavy because of monster battery
Knox is replaced with McAfee

I even tried some games like pubg and call of duty ... Seem to work fine for me ... So overall a monster (excellent) Phone

Samsung rolled out a beauty in the under 20k price range in m31. A completely all round phone which feels good in hand and runs smooth
Battery: 5/5 6000mah, what else do you expect
Screen: 6/5 SAmoled has my heart and soul and I dare you to find a better screen.
Design: 3.5 A little too thick but I guess it's compromisable given the battery is huge. Also the body could be metal or glass but since looks are subjective this phone looks pretty decent
Camera: 4.5/5 A beautiful camera system which works like a charm in daylight as well as night. To some the pictures may appear grainy but that's because of the resolution and efficiency of the screen itself. -.5 due to the limitations on the 64mp cam
Processor:4/5 Exynos run systems never compare to their Snapdragon equivalents but 9611 is pretty decent. After playing high Res games I couldn't see any lags or issues so in conclusion it's not as bad as it is made to sound.
OS: 4/5 the new OS by Samsung is definitely an improvement from their last few versions. But they definitely aren't stock android. Some preinstalled apps are definitely a pain but uninstalling takes matter of seconds. Plus Samsung's security system is A+ and keeps your device safe and also allows data transfer for faster recovery.

Brownie points for having a designated audio jack instead of the type c and also a designated fingerprint sensor over the in screen fingerprint sensor which are always slower.

The phone leaves barely anything to be asked except for maybe an ir blaster, although it may or may not be required by many it does come in handy at times.

Overall: 4.5/5 it's a two horse race for the under 20k segment between Samsungand realme. If you want a phone for general use and a battery powerhouse Samsung m31 seems to be the one.

I wish I could give 6 stars to the battery life... Just amazing. I'm not a very heavy user so i get about 2 days backup. I switched on to power saver at 30% once and got one full day extra, can't imagine how long would it last on ultra power saver.

The camera is really good and beautifully captures all colours.

The screen is flawless. Amoleds, as you'd expect!

The fingerprint is a bit slow sometimes but is quick to unlock. The responsiveness decreases for a short time if you've just turned the phone on.

The software is awesome. The out-of-the-box software is a bit unstable but a recent update fixed it. Clean and shiny interface but with a few apps preinstalled, which can be uninstalled.

I don't play much games but I played CoD and what a gameplay it gives... Smooth as butter. Overheats if you play for long although performance decrease is not too much.

Thanks!

M31 mega monster review after 4 days use
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Not bad (go for m30s If you are short of money as the quality features are same on both the phone)
-----
The above stars are only for battery, AI features and camera.

CONS :
1) SLIGHT HEATING ISSUE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND AS WELL IN THE BACK

2) WIDE ANGLE CAMERA IS NOT CLEAN IF YOU TRY TO ZOOM IN AT ANY PARTICULAR OBJECT

4) POSITION OF SPEAKER IS POOR AS IT GETS BLOCKED WITH FINGERS WHILE PLAYING GAMES OR TEXTING . THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DUAL SPEAKER.

3) NO HEADPHONE AND COVER INSIDE THE BOX

4)GIVEN 6000MAH BATTERY , IT WILL LAST ONLY 1/2 HALF DAYS , WHICH IS OK COMPARED TO OTHER MOBILES

5) 15W CHARGER TAKES 2:30 hrs TO COMPLETE 100%, WHERE AS IF YOU CHARGE THEM THROUGH Mi POWER BANK WITH 18W SPEED IT COMPLETES BIT QUICKER.

6) BIT SLIPPERY IN CORNERS COZ OF WHICH FINDING DIFFICULT TO PLAY GAMES. HOWEVER CASE CAN ELIMINATE THIS ISSUE

7) POOR NIGHT VISION CAMERA.

8) FINGER PRINT UNLOCKER  AS USUAL POOR IN SAMSUNG

PROS:

- FRONT AND BACK CAMERA ARE AWESOME UNDER LIGHTING.

- LASTS 1 AND HALF DAYS OF BATTERY IN EXTREME USE.

-GAMING AND SOME AI FEATURES ARE GOOD.

Obviously it's a  mega monster ü§©
-----
It's a  mega monster  at this price segment ü§ñ I'll tell you the pros and cons
Pros :
‚û°Ô∏èSuper amoled display was so cool, you can't  find this kind of display on this price segment on another brand's....
‚û°Ô∏è Camera is also so cool, I can't say it's a crystal clear  cam, but it's so cool on this price segment...
‚û°Ô∏è It's too handy as well, with curvy edges  it's fit your hand so cool, you won't even feel it's 191 grams weigh....
‚û°Ô∏èExynos 9611 (10nm) Chipset is good to  play high graphics games too....Games like pubg starts with high quality graphics on default,  Almost it's equal to Snapdragon 712 Chipset...
‚û°Ô∏è It's doesn't matter that you are a heavy user,the 6000 mah will easily make it a day easily without any issues...
‚û°Ô∏è Ear piece is good as well, no issues on receiving sounds...

‚ö†Ô∏èCons...

‚û°Ô∏è  Macro cam mode is not that good as we expected....
‚û°Ô∏è As so far, I can't find any more issues....

Hope it'll help :)

Truly a Megagalaxy of Samsung universe.
-----
Thanks for the Samsung( really I'm in song with it) for an all in one mobile set at an effective price. Till date,I am not a big fan of Samsung, as they produced mobiles at a bit expensive rate in comparison to other companies producing the same features at a lower price, but with this product, they completely got above everyone. Have been using it from past 3 days, the mobile amazed me with its battery backup, the camera was too good. While watching videos, it was a colorful and bright experience. I haven't experienced any pause while using applications till now. The finger print sensor is very fast in response. Over all to sum it up, it was a pretty good buy at this price. I suggest fellow buyers to go with 128gb rather than 64gb, as you are getting it, just for an extra 1000.

True monster
-----
Purchsed one on launch. Had almost made up my mind to buy M30s but saw notification of this M31 being launched so kept my purchase on hold. The features were good at the price. The wait was worthy. Now using almost since 3 months.
Truely monster battery. With my use easily lasts bit more than 2 days. Fast charging supported. 50% charged within about 40 min with the provided 9V charger. This is sufficient for a day if one is in hurry to leave for work. By the time one gets ready the phone can be charged 50% almost.
Full charge takes about 2.30 hrs. Samsung should have provided a 15 V charger in box as they provide to all the YouTube reviewers. All reviewers spoke of inbox 15W charger.
I would have given 5 star rating in all categories then.
The finger print scanner occasionally fails to unlock with finger print. Have to press the lock button and unlock again with the finger then. Don't know the reason why this happens.
Though I am not a selfie lover or one who keeps on clicking photos often, I found the camera quality good enough, both front and back.
Sound quality is ok. Though feel the speaker could have been bit louder.
No doubts about Samsung amoled display, it's the best. Samsung being pioneer in this. Very bright even with low settings.
Signal reception has no problem.
Expandable memory is a good feature we usually do not see now in flagship phones also.
Overall good product at this price. Go for it.

BEST BUDGET PHONE TILL NOW
-----
Pros--

1. SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY
  Yes the main purpose to purchase this phone is the display experience if u love to watch YouTube, Movies, Songs, etc. don't think just go for it. The sAMOLED display quality feels you premium which cannot provide by other brands in this price range. Samsung sAMOLED  is excellent compare to other brands sAMOLED.(I.e. realme, etc.)

2. 64MP QUAD CAMERA, 32MP FRONT
  CAMERA
  Camera quality is awesome. It is improved compare to M30s 48mp triple rear, 16mp front camera and gives u more details while clicking pics. But when taking low light photos it performs average, sometimes details are missing and gives u blur photos.

Note: Price is 15k not expect too much because other brands also lack in low light photos in this price range.

3. 6000mah BATTERY
  Battery backup is pretty good because sAMOLED display consumes less battery compare to (IPS)LCD, TFT display. It gives u 1.5 days battery backup which cannot given by 4000mah, 5000mah.

4. ONE UI, 6GB RAM
  Samsung one ui gives u time to time updates at least 2 yrs and above. It feels u cool compare to miui, realme mi etc. 6gb ram in this price range is just awesome because samsung A series will not provide this in 15k.

Cons--

1. EXYNOS 9611 OCTA CORE PROCESSOR
  Samsung M30s is also come with this processor. Samsung should also upgrade the processor and give at least Qualcomm sd675 or above this time. Exynos 9611 is gud for daily purpose but if u are heavy gamer then it feels u bad. This processor is now outdated this time. Performance of exynos 9611 is similar to sd660 and sd665 which is below than sd675.

2. MISSING NFC, SAMSUNG PAY, KNOX
  SECURITY
  A series provide these features but M series will not which is very disappointed for samsung user. Knox Security is samsung selfmade manufactured feature that's why it should also come in M series.

3. BUILD QUALITY
  Back side build quality is just plastic so u have to use gud back cover to avoid scratches and any other harm. A series Build quality feels u premium that's why M series are cheaper compare to A series.

4. 15 WATT CHARGER
  It has massive battery 6000mah but 15 w charger is not sufficient, it takes 2.45hrs to charge the phone 0 to 100%.Samsung should upgrade this and can give atleast 27watt charger this time.

Note-

1.Samsung always try to save money and this time they also achieve this by these all 4 cons. But in my opinion it is best package in 15k because A series are very expensive if we purchasing for these features.

2. If compare to other Chinese brands samsung phones are durable for long term uses and provide many service centers everywhere to resolve issues.

Performance  is slow. Don't buy (Very poor.. ghost touching problem)

Initial review
Performance  of the phone is slow for normal day to day activities.  You can lag in opening  apps like outlook, gmail and any other  day to day apps. Some items you can see lag in animation. I have changed setting to use less animation after that also seeing  the performance lags. No worth for amount.  The reason for performance  is Samsung uses their own processor  which slow.

After one week of usage
if the phone batter down to 20%, then phone will go to completely not usable state. Finally i put charge and re-started the phone to make it work.

Camera is good. Battery stands for 1.5 days for normal usage. Worst performance phone for day of day use.

Finally, here is the root of the problem. This mobile has ghost touching problem. Totally useless now.

Review of SAMSUNG M31 after using it for 4 days..
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I am writing this review after using this phone for 4day.
This is a best budget phone in the range of 15000 as whatever u want  all the things are inside this phone, if u compare this phone  With One plus 7T  Then in camera and battery backup  this phone get a Superb value. I think in this price no any phone has battery backup of 6000mah.. and really its battery is outstanding. Same thing with its main camera I.es 64 mega pixel. A Superb camera quality .. It has failed ONe plus 7t phone camera .. so best phone in this much price.
I want to explain it's some feature as below
1stly Battery 5star
2ndly camera 64mega pixel - 5star , There is a slow motion vedio making function enabled in the camera , which is really good.
3rd Front camera - 4star.
4th Processor - 4star
5th RAM - 5star I.es 6GB ram is best for Heavy application.
6th Touches - As samsung is famous for its smooth touch so - 5star. Really awesome touch
7th - Dark mode and blue light filter are also included - 4star
These all ratings are out of 5.
Now REMEDIES / DRAWBACK of this phone is
1st - It has non metal bodies, so u can't use it rough and tough .
2ndly - little bit Heating problem during the charging of phone, and using heavy memory game, or any any Heavy software.
3rd - it's back side camera is little bit outside , so there is a maximum chance of scratch.
4th - heavy weighted phone. Phone should be slim , but it is not a slim phone, it has much high thickness.
Overall , If  someone  want to buy A phone @15000, And also  He/she is  interested in photography , and need a long more battery backup then One's should must go to this phone. But if someone  want a rough n tough phone . Then he/ she  may avoid ,  as it is a non metallic body shaped phone.. And heating problem of the phone cause a huge effects..

Not a impressive phone....üòèüòè
It's  just average  product .....
I was using Lenovo k8 plus, just bought for 8k before 2 years...its working better than galaxy m31..
Dolby atmos is not working at all in galaxy m31....
I bought galaxy m31 after seeing YouTube reviews..... now only I found that they all are paid reviews...üòåüòåüôÑüôÑüôÑ

If you want a complete phone, please  choose any another brand like redmi, realme or something else

I am not satisfied with this phone...

If you have any questions,  please ask me...my cell number 8489558489

M31 is a Monster !! Best phone in 15K wd 64mp quad camera, amoled full hd disp,6k mh battery,6gb ram
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Iam always been big fan of samsung display and camera and ever since I had used them I haven't thought ant going 4 other chinese brands with cheap LCD display on which u can neither appreciate a good pic nor game or enjoy movies on it!!

6.4" Full hd Amoled screen + 64 mp/32 mp camera + 6000 mah battery wd fast charging was too much to ignore even when MI &amp; realme were giving very competent specs at lower price but it's lcd display &amp; camera was not 4 me hence I went for M31  and it outperformed my expectations!!
From phone display to camera quality to battery life to processor it was just perfect for me in 15K..

I wud hv appreciated a gradient glossy panel but ocean blue color is actually very beautiful and shiny and phone doesn't feel heavy at all!!
Battery is huge and for full charging it does take time but it can easily last a day on 50‚ÑÖ charge for normal usage so iam not worried abt battery life and 15w charger  !!

6 GB ram is the most impressive feature of this phone,thank u samsung.

64 MP rear camera and 32 mp front were treat to click , u don't need any 3rd party app to adjust/beautify ur clicks such gr8 has been camera quality of M31!!

Slow motion recording both front and back was the feature I was looking forward to and I loved it!!

Iam not a heavy gamer but this phone can play pubg ,asphalt, mortal kombat and other heavy games wd ease!!

Finger print reader works well this time in samsung M31 !

Few tips and tricks:

By def front camera is 21 MP in order to select 32 MP option select wide-angle option and then select 3:4 full option and u will see camera size 32 mp.

For rear camera 64 mp option is available in options u hv to just look into it

Slow motion is available in both front and back camera but super slow motion is available in rear camera only! Loved that feature!

Only downside I found was knox security not present but u can always install a good antivirus to keep ur m31 safe!!
McAfee is there anyway to keep u safe!!

No complaints only praise for this beautiful and affordable monster, if ur planning to upgrade ur fone wd impressive quad camera , beautiful display and huge battery M31 will not disappoint u, it is d best phone in terms of camera, battery, display and with 6gb ram and xynos latest processor it can easily do multitasking and gaming wd ease.. I loved it,it works like a charm

M31 over iPhone 7Plus
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I purchased a Black 6/64 varient on 4th May and in 3 weeks I can confirm that I regret purchasing an iphone 7plus worth 62 thousand that too 3 years ago.
I am not a user who will zoom a picture and compare the pixals, honestly, is that needed? You dont really zoom pictures more than your phone's size so why make the hype.

About the security, I was concerned previously but as I was already using Google apps so I dont really think this scares me at all.

The performance of the phone is really amazing and the reason why is got this phone out of a number of product makes me happy everyday: 2 days battery life on good use.

Somewhere I also feel that this phone provides me more features than ios 13. I don't really miss charging my iphone twice a day lol
-----
Things to consider before purchasing M31
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
So, you decided to purchase the M31, based on its ratings and reviews? Then you must think about the following facts if you want to buy it:

1. If you have more money, go for a higher priced phone like A70s. This phone has the features of other phones which are in the price bracket of 18k-22k.

2. The battery backup is very good, my phone lasts 3 days on a single charge, with WiFi on all day, 2-3 hours of browsing throughout the day and moderate calling of 1-2 hours per day. However, if you want to exploit the phone by playing games all day long, you have to charge the phone everyday. Games run smooth, but this is not a gaming phone. You should target something in the price bracket of 35k+ for that purpose.

3. Phone is sturdy and looks great. Drop it from a height of 2 feet and it will be okay. Spray water on it, and still it will be ok.

4. Camera is really good for normal photography including slow mo, fast shutter speed, good colour reproduction, and daytime photography. Night time photography is decent, but don't expect it to perform like a 50k phone. It will produce photos like a 20k phone should.

5. Charging time is around 2.5 hours if you are on 0% charge. But it charges very fast to 85%. So, if you start charging it from 40%, it will take around 30-45 minutes to get fully charged.

6. Phone does not get hot under any circumstances, does not hand, does not restart.

7. Phone display is very bright, even in bright sunlight.

8. Phone UI is good, with some bloatware like NETFLIX.

9. Headphone is not given with phone.
-----
Excellent

5.0 out of 5 stars

Excellent product. Worth buying it.

Pros:
Massive 6k battery. Goes on and on.
4 rear cameras with the main one at 64mp.
Excellent front cam.
Blue color looks stunning.
S amoled screen with always on display.
Finger print and face unlock work superb.
Android 10.

Cons:
Limited bloatware, Samsung apps, which can be disabled at least which is good.
Back panel absorbs fingerprints easily. Needs frequent cleaning.
Doesn't come with an earphone. You can buy one outside per your choice.

Suggestions:
Buy a back case and tempered glass for extra safety, though it has gorilla glass.

6+128 is priced 1k extra. I think 6+64 is quite enough and you can buy another 64gb memory card within 650-700 rs, so saving a little and increasing more data mobility.

Never look at M30 or M30s. You get M31 for the same price with much better camera.

Competitive Mega Monster
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
A complete mega Monster.  This phone brings back Samsung in competition with the Chinese brands which has captured the market share in recent years.

Before writing this review, let me tell you'll a short brief on my requirements and background. I'm middleaged,  working professional from Mumbai and my requirements were basic usage with some multimedia at the EOD. And I'm not a gamer. This is my 3rd mobile in 4 years and prior to this,  I've been using A popular known brand and model,  Redmi Note 4 since 2017 and another from upcoming company Realme with it's launch model Realme1 since Jun 2018. And my very first Android phone was none other than Samsung Galaxy M (CDMA model) So my experience and expectations were coming from the usage of these 2 recent handsets.
I wanted a mobile which gives me a smooth touch experience (lagging in Realme 1) with a decent performance with best battery (lagging in RN4) and a large storage within a budget of 15k.
This mobile may not be the best for full time gamers however it can definitely help you get a good 2 days battery life (with all day usage with bluetooth connected) with a smooth and vibrant looking display with its super amoled screen and knocking performance for all day to day needs including some gaming.  And I'm completely satisfied with Samsung Galaxy M31 for this. With its new OneUI 2.0, I'm completely amazed with the kind of adaptations Samsung has done from its earlier Galaxy series.

I use to always feel, Samsung is am expensive brand and it always offer less against what we pay, however, must say, Samsung changed my perception towards Samsung mobiles. If your planning to upgrade for a smooth all around performance with a huge battery and a sexy display with a budget around 15-16k, go for it and you will love owing it...

after 6 days of use:
Camera 5/5
Performance 5/5
Display 5/5
Battery 5/5
Phone look 5/5
User interface 5/5
Sound 5/5
awesome phone
Pros:
1. It looks stunning with the AMOLED display and looks like a high-end category phone.
2. The battery is so powerful. literally a mini power bank. once fully charged it lasts for more than 2 days with heavy usage .
3. Fast charging. and the phone is very handy with lightweight. never expected the phone to be this much light with a huge 6000 Miah battery.
4. The camera is awesome. didn't expect a good camera and a mini power bank at this price range. wide-angle shots are as awesome as high-end phones.
5 , Touch Response  ‚Äì Fast, precise, with low latency. Particularly noticeable on the keyboard, quick toggle menu, as well as when knocking off notifications or deleting feeds on say, the Chrome browser. Faster animations further this experience.
6, Good call quality and Cellular Reception.
 value for money at this price .

Everything is better than expected. Just one thing can't resolve: JioCall app doesn't work. Though jio internet works, calls also are ok. Only app itself is not ok. I tried to check sim setting, mobile data settings, to restart the phone, everything - but nothing helps. Maybe there's no need of this app actually as soon as everything works without so it's ok.

This phone is the best phone which we can buy currently especially when this is coming from a brand like Samsung

1. The first thing is the screen which is very crisp and clear. Love watching movies on it.

2. The processor is fast and one of the best in this price range.

3. The battery which is 6000 mah even with a heavy phone usage will easily last you through the day and even more.

4. The finger print reader works well.

5. The camera is really good with great output all around.

All in all, it ticks all the right boxes and you are guaranteed to enjoy this phone. A very easy recommendation for all.

Awesome phone..I am writing  this review after using  the phone after more than 1 month. Both rear  and front camera is awesome  and quality of picture is good..it suport 4K videos..I am bit disappointed  on battery quality and charging ponit..It is not up to the mark on 6000mAh battery..It takes 3-4 hr to charge the full battery  and discharge within a day.If you will play game,it will discharge withi  10 hr.I am not playing games much,so I am satified but I won't support to buy this phone if you paly games all most of the time in a day.Also I am not happpy  on face recognition..I feel as It doesn't  support sometime..But overall it is a good phone.

Im writing this review after using it 20 days.

 I have received my phone on 8th March ,ordered on 5th march when the sell has started.
when I took this in my hand ,feel very light weight if comparision to 6000mah mega battery, I watched a movie of 2hour and 5 mins and it consumed only 20% battery ,battery life is very great ,it runs approx 1 to 1and half day after full charge. Charging time is approx 140 minutes.

Its camera quality is outstanding , night mode is also hats off, macro camera is so pretty if compare to other brands,It is completely one handed phone. so many features are available in this phone.
It has a very very very smooth processor. Now if talking about display that what a display is it. M31 has Curved display like which is given on samsung S8, S9 OR S10. It feels like premium display, Dark mode is outstanding..I always use dark mode.
Rear fingerprint is also working properly. It has a great quad camera set up. Worth for money...

Not good as expected

1.0 out of 5 stars

Not worth it when you compare it with Xiaomi phones

Issues

--Heavier than MI phones
--Screenshot is not by scrolling  3 fingers as in MI phones. You need to press power button and volume button simultaneously
--screen mirroring is very poor does not works
-- Camera is also poor than MI phones
-- while opening web link gives only one option to open using Samsung Browser.
-- many other usability issues.
--overall you will feel going back to MI due to issues in usability

Best Mobile for this price. Camera is par at the best. Both the front and rear cameras are excellent and the result is very detailed and very minute, previously was using Vivo V9 that to bought at Amazon. Low light photography is ok. Touch is excellent. Battery back up is also very good. Processing is very good without any lagging and no heating issues even at very very long usage, almost day long. Stylish and the curved edge screen is excellent

Pros-
superb battery. 1- 1.5 day

6 GB Ram (more than my laptop)
Very nice call quality (I uses Airtel)

Feels very nice in hand and can be easily hold in one hand.

Cons-
Face unlock is slowww and few times didn't worked.
Can't uninstall Netflix, Facebook and few other Samsung's app but these can be disabled.
Got around 50 GB out of 64 GB.
No back cover provided in box.
Finger prints are all over the back.

Verdict

Best phone to buy around this budget. Super value for money. I am very happy to have this phone.
Don't think just buy it. You won't regret.

Samsung Galaxy M31 is the Perfect package out there. The Mega 6000mah battery easily gives me 2 days of battery backup. The 64mp camera gives amazing details in the photos. And the best part is, you can also take macro shots, not just with the macro lens, but with the help of 64MP camera too.
I was looking for few of things from my new phone. I wanted a great camera, great battery backup, unique and elegant looking design on the back of the phone. Samsung Galaxy M31 provides all of it. Plus a Super-AMOLED display. Samsung is THE best display manufacturer out there. The exynos chipset is no less than any other chipset in the market.
This phone has made me decide that my future phones will be of Samsung.

Problem
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I have a Samsung M31
SYMPTOMS

a) all videos regardless of the application used are playing on fastforward with no sound. This happens on all apps incl youtube, netflix, amazon prime, including videos I have been sent via WhatsApp. b) there is no sound on the phone at all - nothing when I play music, it doesn't ring when someone calls me, and even though i can pick up the call, I can't hear the other person's voice and they cant hear mine

 ATTEMPTED FIXES THAT DID NOT WORK
1. Restart multiple times
2. Reset app preferences
3. Play with Dolby settings (restore to default, turn off/on)
4. Wipe cache preferences using volume up/down buttons then rebooting
5. Adjusting all the volume settings to make sure nothing was muted
6. Turn phone on on safe mode to ensure it wasnt the apps that were buggy (and played a video I had stored on my phone but same issue)

Rethink before buying this phone specially online

Guys don't become a fool and buy this phone
The phone will start hanging and will switch off in between a call. Touch will not work , you have to end up pressing the touch multiple times to accept end calls or to do any work on phone.
Battery life is ok ok
Phones started hanging in just 2 days
And more painful is that Amazon does not have return policy for this. They will send some technician to check it and "if " he finds issue phone will be replaced.
If I would have known this I would never have purchased it from here.
Now only god knows how my problem will be solved. I have came across such issue 1st time ever as I always preferred to buy such electronic items from physical store or not to go for any random low budget phone to avoid any complexity.

Rethink before buying this phone from amazon ( if u faced any difficulty they won't return or refund the amount)

Very Good Features. You just can't compare with 2 yrs back Samsung mid range smartphones.  they were really not value for money. but now situation is different.  the screen is really superb. everything is good except face lock. and the best part is it's a very trustable brand. nowadays privacy is the biggest concern and after hearing about the Xiaomi's case i am not gonna trust any chinese brand. i have poco f1 too but now the situation is different and i will not trust any chinese brand again. It's a promise

After using an iphone this phone feels quite low in performance. The screen resolution is not sharp, the camera has filters but images are not sharp. A bit slow response to certain apps.
Otherwise good with fingerprint response, battery life is amazing overall for the price it's good for general use.

Overall good experience

Overall it's good. But there features which are different from what I expected.
The charger is not that slow. It's good enough.
The battery doesn't last that long as I expected. Its above average.
The position is of earphone jack is at the bottom, which is not convenient for me personally. Especially during video calls, it better to have at the top.
The RAM is 6GB but 2-3gb is pre occupied. So I suggest only go for 6GB RAM.
The loud speaker could be better in terms of quality as well as intensity of loudness.

Overall it's a very good phone.

Samsung galaxy m31 is awesome though there was a hickup at software update

I am updating my old review because Samsung has provided excellent service via email to troubleshoot my galaxy M31 download struck issue, the mobile is performed well as of now, it is an excellent mobile because I am surprised when others are provided good feedback on my video call, the pics are also awesome, I have taken my little daughter's pic which was my favourite photo ever with this awesome Galaxy M31 mobile.
If you want to know about my previous problem here it is, but Samsung solved it remotely without visiting the service center.:

Galaxy M31 stuck at 'Downloading...Do not turn off target', ODIN MODE (AVB Fail)
SUPER: Build-id does not match with the reference
(SUPER) : 30278215R, (BOOTLOADER) : 29256088
I have tried to restart using Volume down+power button then samsung logo comes and then immediately it shows Downloading... blue screen. Tried many times but no use at all, My daily work is purely depending on this mobile but due to this problem I cannot use this mobile at all now, this will make my days too dangerous about my job during this corona lock down,  so contacted  samsungchat assistant but they suggested to visit the service center, but due corona lock down no service center available, I do not understand why should I visit the service center because it is a software problem not the hardware problem, I have tried to search the issue in Google it seems most of the Galaxy M31 mobiles facing the same issue, so I suggest samsung people should look into this issue ASAP and resolve it automatically without visiting the service centre by force update some thing

A good alternative for Chinese brands.

I was waiting for launching this phone &amp; purchased on 1st day of sale.My requirement was good camera ,display &amp; decent battery life.There was lot of alternative for this phone like poco x2,realms x2,Realme 6 &amp;pro ,Redmi Note 9( going to launch this week) since I don't want Chinese brand I not considered those.
Pros
1)Good day light photos
2)Long battery backup
3)AMOLED Display
4)Samsung UI

Cons
1)Camera clarity lacks in indoor &amp; night
2)Charging time is more because of 6000mAh battery only with 15W charger.
3)Polycarbonate body.

This is hands down the best smartphone available in the market at this price range. It performs great in almost every department.
Cameras(both front and rear) are amazing. Clicks amazing detailed shots.
Battery(6000 mah) is outrageous. Lasts for a day(heavy usage) or two(normal usage) easily.
UI(one UI 2.0) is fantastic. Smooth and buttery experience.
Display(Super Amoled FHD+)is gorgeous. Viewing angles are fantastic and color reproduction is amazing.
Processor(Exynos 9611) is quite powerful. While it is not a gaming centered phone it performs above average in all high end games.
Considering to but a smartphone with the best value for money? Then this is the best pick!

OMG!!!
Fabulous one!
I just love this one. Samsung just has brought a best phone for us under 20k.
Since, I've been using this product, I found it better than any other phone in market. The most impressive  thing I find is it's UI, battery, camera and smooth screen(higher refresh rates). It's camera is really fabulous one. The battery of this phone do never let you down from using. It's UI is too user friendly. I found it best in every aspect. It's terrible combination of it's price and features makes me mad. Guys, I solemnly recommend you to have purchase of this product.thanks!
Hopefully, I think you find this review helpful.

One of the best satisfying phone I ever had in my life. After 7 days of use I find that the phone has a longer battery storage keeps long lasting , camera,  videos  and functions like hyperlapse,  slow motion mode,  superslowmotion mode is commendable to use. Display is big enough with curve design, looks are fantastic.  Eye catching masterpiece. Speakers are good ..faster enough..
Go for it people

5.0 out of 5 stars

Pros:
6GB RAM,64MP rear camera,32MP Front Camera,6000mah battery and more over Samsung is brand,Gorilla glass 3,Sound is good especially DOLBY ATMOS,AMOLED Display
Cons:
Some what delay in recognizing face especially in low light conditions, Back Panel build with Plastic
And remaining is good And you have to buy ear phones and case and Temper glass/Screen Protector.I am using phone since five days I didn't face any problems and more over that this phone will have some lags while playing pubg.So game lovers didn't like this phone I mean you will play up to medium level games but large exams like PUBG..etc you will face some lags.But except game lovers every common man like this phone and it fulfills all his needs.

Now firstly for the pubg lovers I would like to tell you that it easily runs pubg at HDR ultra settings of graphics with no lag you just need to activate performance mode which obviously uses more battery give best performance.The phone has three battery modes by default it will be in performance mode ,( takes as much juice possible from your battery to handle your heavy tasks, multitasking, etc. And once you it last easily 2 days. Cameras are awesome it's a bit warmer and soft images but details are amazing and other colours.....
Guys literally there are loads of features and don't want to write an essay over here it will be tedious for you all to read....
Trust me I'm using it as my daily driver and had no issues ya it may not have 90Hzs but who needs it in day to day budget life. Don't think just go for it and you enjoy it phone ...... #bestbudgetphone...

Samsung galaxy M 31 review
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Product is very good. This mobile phone has best battery backup. Anyone can think 6000 mah battery with 64 mp rear back camera and 32 mp front camera. The fingerprint is responding so fast. Fack lock is outstanding. Security level is very good. This mobile phone has mamy more features like- screenshot with hand. Screen display is very smooth with gorilla glass. The Samsung prosser of this phone is best for gaming. The ram is very good and rom also. This phone also produces just small amount of radiation compare to other phone. I think this mobile can beat I phone also and at last I recommend this phone to that who want  mobile phone working for 2 or 3 year. I really....... Like this phone Samsung. Your company is best for me.

The first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31 is its design. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is good. The battery 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support, 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with an AMOLED screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels and Samsung Exynos 9611 processor, are some excellent feature of the Samsung Galaxy M31 Smartphone, which no other competitor is offering right now at this price point.
after 7 days of uses:
Phone design &amp; look - 5/5
Camera  - 5/5
Performances  -5/5
Display  - 5/5
Battery  -5/5
User interface  -5/5
Sound  -5/5
awesome phone

Great display with average camera
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Great display for the price range and I am happy that I shifted to Samsung for this reason.
Battery life is good and lasts for almost 2 days with normal usage with WiFi, but it's not the best as it drains quickly with 4G.
Camera is decent when it's outdoor. At low light and indoors it's just an average camera. Live focus selfies and night mode(front and rear)are useless. Live focus / portrait blurs out some portion of the face which is very bad.
Call quality and speaker quality is fine.
Samsung One UI is good but it misses out some of the important features as it's M series phone.
-----
Value for money

5.0 out of 5 stars

I ordered the phone on 5th March'20 and got on 8th March'20 as promised by Amazon I had been using this phone for past 3 days. Kindly find my review below.
Pros:
Amazing battery. Single charge for 2 days minimum.
Screen clarity is good. SAMOLED display
Processor speed is ok.
Played PUBG for continous 3 hours. Battery drained by 10% only.
Phone is light weight.
Wifi calling.
5G wifi support.
Loved this dark mode.
Samsung VPN.
Cons:
Heating up issues as in all Galaxy M series.
Camera quality is average.
Full charge requires 2 hrs.

Finally 15,999 for Samsung is ok to buy.

Mega Monsters review - Go for it
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Review after 4 days usage:

The phone is very good in terms of what it offers for 16 thousand mid range segment. Pros,cons and final verdict below.

Pros:
1. Camera is solid. Far better then any other mobiles in this segment. Live focus,slow motion and other features work perfectly. Have attached live focus,normal pick, normal video and slowmo. If you want great camera performance this is the mobile
2. Battery is wonderful, no need to tell it's a beast 6000 Mah
3. Display is crisp and very sensitive
4. Game play is also great, pubg works well in normal graphics
5. Build is also very good, not as bad as they are reviewed it's a decent build for this segment but not much smudge proof. Use back cover.

Cons:
1. Slow charging due to 15w but this is not a problem as 1 time charge will last you while day
2. Some times the apps icons on up swipe do not display, once locked and unlocked it reappears not much of an issue must be software or due to heavy graphics wall papers. Will check further and update.

Final verdict is to go for the mobile if you are keen on camera, display and battery. For game play pubg note 8 pro might perform well in graphics side but this does a decent job as well. It worth it guys, its actually a mega monster #megamonster #sansung

Best Buy
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
First of all , I would say the phone has extremely good battery life while using continuously (Gaming Netflix) it delivers upto 13-14 hrs backup

Fingerprint reader is very fast, phone gets unlocked with just a touch

Camera quality is also very good in daylight and in low light it is satisfactory

I didn't face any lag while playing PUB-G , the phone did a great job.

 I also loved the Super amoled display, it delivers a very good quality viewing experience.

Overall the phone is doing a great Job, I didn't face any problems as of now loved it :)

Excellent, Bank for the Buck!!!

This fingerprint reader is faster then my last mobile, and much more fast then in screen fingerpring.
The camara quality is good, and took nice portrait shorts.(here I uploaded some pics for m31)
And I really like the display and build, although I had 6000 may battery weight distribution is even

Really enjoying 6000mah battery, it gets more then 1 day of Battery life and 10Hrs of ScreenOn time,
Even flagships like S20,note 10, OnePlus, iPhone doesn't get this battery life (they get around 5-7hrs approx)
If it gets a fast charger in the box it could be much more easy to charge massive battry

If u are not a power user or a heavy gamer, this is a perfect buy
Mainly elders dont use heavy apps or games, if they use it in battery saver mode, it can easily get 2 days of battery life for them.

Note**
One of the Main reason to buy is Samsung security feature, if Ur cell is lost you track it with Samsung website immediately (if net is on), and "NOBODY CAN SWITCH OFF" your mobile unit they have Ur Password or pattern

I think this review helpful
Thank you.......

Phone gets heated up after few mins of usage!!!
-----
2.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I use my phone for almost around 18 hrs in 24hrs!! I don't know if the heating issue is due to that or not. But its getting heated up after using it for few mins. If you have your phone idle for sometime it cools down but then the instant you start to use it, it gets heated up. Can't have it over ear to speak on a call.

PERFORMANCE : 4 stars
CAMERA : 5 stars, too cool!!! Jus as promised!!
BATTERY: 3 stars, cuz once its below 30, it starts to drain too quickly.
SPEAKER: When playing COD/PUBG in landscape mode, the fingers goes over speaker and restricts the audio... Which is really annoying. If you switch to the other way, the notch takes up space and hides game controls like firing button.
AUDIO JACK : Could've been on top. Being in bottom is so annoying that i couldn't place my phone over ground while on vid call.
SCREEN CAST : Works perfectly. I tried with my Mi smart tv and its cool.

Everything else is fine.
Would be perfect if heating issue is fixed.

A very VFM MidRanger
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
My previous phone had a cracked LCD and was on the lookout for a new phone. Thanks to the lockdown, had lots of time on my hand to review most phones, get firsthand accounts from friends and then make a choice.
To be honest, my first preference was the OP8 and was looking for video reviews when I stumbled upon this phone. Samsung seems to have packaged a decent bit of hardware and specifications on this phone which gets most of your job done.
Disclaimer: If you are an avid gamer, then this is not for you unless you are ready to make trade offs
What I Like the most:
1. Comes with Android one UI v2. The phone has a near bloat free experience and very close to stock android. However, some of the features are masked by Samsung, I'm if those will be available in higher end or flagship models like S20 / S20 Note etc. However, loving the features like Dark mode, use Camera flash for notification, ability to capture more than one face etc.
2. Amazing display, the AmOLED display is a pleasure to view and even can be used under direct sunlight.
3. The phone comes with support for two sims and SD card, which is good for avid music lovers like me to stash and carry my ever-growing collection of music &amp; videos.
4. Samsung switch App, for once I have a product from Samsung which does the job without any fuzz. Was able to transfer my data from my broken phone using this.
5. The Camera is of decent quality, so far, the pictures have turned out well, but still exploring so will reserve my comments for now.
What I don‚Äôt like
1. 6000 MAH battery adds to the weight but gives the same performance as my old phone 4000 MAH battery. Could have tweaked battery usage
2. The build is dated, and the naked phone may not draw any oohs &amp; aahs from onlookers. Plastic body is prone to scratches and fingerprints, so better invest in a case.
3. No headphones provided by Samsung, not sure if this is the trend, but a simple 100 Rs earphone could have enhanced the VFM perspective.
4. Lastly the Exynos processor, so far, I‚Äôve not notices any lag or slowness, but at times I feel that the phone is a tad unresponsive especially when I try to pull down the notification panel or try to dismiss a few apps.
Overall Verdict:
It‚Äôs a bargain buy with good specifications, recommend purchasing this.

Great (probably the best) phone at this price range.

Nice (probably the best) phone at this price range.
Here is my take (rating based on 5 stars)on the specs:
Looks and feel - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚≠ê
Processor - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê I still think Snapdragon 8** is better
Video - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Sound - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Battery life - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Charging - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Connectivity - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê video call experience is great with Vodafone 4g
Camera - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê best feature of the phone, wide angle lens is too good

Bottomline: I would definitely recommend this phone
-----
What a bang for buck, way better than other phones at this price range.

Honestly didn't expect this phone to be soo good. The software animations are so fluid, the camera is crazy good and the screen is obviously best in the market coz. Its Samsung's. I'm listing some pros and cons down here, be sure to read it. Also I've posted photos shot on this phone for reference.

Pros:
‚Ä¢Samsung's one UI is way better than the competition like Redmi's crappy MIUI.
‚Ä¢The camera's are just too good, the HDR shots are amazing and the 64mp rear and 32mp front camera modes are just the cherry on top.
‚Ä¢6000 mah battery is absolute overkill for a phone at this price.
‚Ä¢The screen is really good, it's Amoled and can get pretty bright outdoors and pretty dim for indoors too.
‚Ä¢The processor is really good too, enough for any task u throw on this.
‚Ä¢Fingerprint scanner is on the back instead of in the screen thus it's faster, more reliable and better.
‚Ä¢Amazon delivered the phone in 24 hrs with exchange so it was amazing.

Cons. :
‚Ä¢No fastcharger in the box even when it supports it, so charging to 100% takes too long.
‚Ä¢In wide angle camera, there's no lens correction like in Samsung's Hughes end phones so photos look weird at the corners(I've uploaded a wide angle photo for reference).
‚Ä¢phone can get a little bit hot while gaming, but not crazy hot so it's fine.
‚Ä¢The 64mp photos are not that crisp so I just stick to normal camera mode.

Worst Samsung mobile ever

Please don't buy this phone. It has major heating issues. It gets drastically heated while watching videos, while taking photos, during calls and also while charging. 6000mah battery is just for name sake. It works for 1 to 1.25 days without heavy usage. Full charging takes upto 3hrs. Speaker quality is also bad.
The only good thing about this phone is camera.
-----
Very hanging and slow operating

Worst phone ever I bought. I ordered the phone in 1st day of lunch. I got timely delivery but  After using for 29 days phone got hang up while updating software. Now phone is locked for more than 2days in a screen showing AVB error . I tried to restart phone many time but still showing same . Even I let the phone to get switch off by itself after consumption of battery still showing same while charging.Now I can't return it because they say return period were till 27th march. Lockdown nation wide still on can't go to Samsung care centre. I'm giving those stars because I don't have any option for zero.I don't understand what should I do.

It's handy &amp; worth considering

I haven't come across such a great camera at this cost. Battery is just keep going until you get off...optimal size &amp; screen details are amazing..over all, ...fingerprint sencer at back &amp; follow your commands instantly without any glitch  ..never ending battery I experienced..using it for more than month now...it's get on well with me...screen size is nothing but perfect what I looking for &amp; the phone is much convenient in holding it ...no second thought if you desperately need a phone ...a complete package to complete a man!!!!!

A very good phone at this price point

Excellent phone with all the necessary specs for a fantastic deal. I bought this at 14999. At that price I needed 4 things:
a) Good processing power and RAM
b) Sufficient internal memory &amp; expansion
c) Good battery
d) Good camera

I'm very happy with the first 2. I have a 128GB card which houses all my data and hence,
64GB was more than enough for me. Battery doesn't feel like a 6000mAh. My charge runs down to 30% by the end of the day. But this might be because of extensive initial setup. This is why I'd give it less than 5 stars. Another problem is the call-speaker volume is not great.
The camera is mostly good and sufficient for candid photography. The sensor is what matters and it is good enough for this price point.
Some of the built-in features are good.
In short, I'm happy with my purchase.

Cool phone

5.0 out of 5 stars

I upgraded from a 4 year old samsung. So as soon as I got hands on experience with this phone, I was amazed by how smooth the experience was.

Samsung has moved onto the budget phone market and has established an elegant line of phones.

Pros:
 - The finger print sensor is fast and very responsive
 - The battery lasts a good 2 days.
 - Faster compared to other budget phones in the 15k~ range
 - The build quality is nice
 - Despite the size, it's a very light phone

Cons:
 - Battery takes 3 hours to charge completely
 - Even though it has a nice back, it is prone to fingerprints, and scratches
 - Thicker than normal

Phone is good. Value for money, but sound quality is not good. While playing Facebook,Youtube and other MX Player or internal video's it's not getting sound. If I restart then phone then its sounding. I'm facing oftenly but it's not resolved yet. And Wifi hotspot is not working properly while connecting to desktop or Laptop. But its connecting to mobiles. I raised for exchange phone, let's see what will happen. But I never expects this type of problems by SAMSUNG. Really upset....!!

I got it on Saturday morning. You will get a mobile and charge. Which is OK. No phone cover, no earphone, no screen glass.
Everything is fine now coming on the battery part.
6000mh honestly??? I charged it 100 percent in the night and today in the evening It was 56 and I didn't used it a lot. But I think it is okay in this price range ... I don't play games but if you are a games lovers. You need to think it twice.
 battery part is a questionable thing.
Face lock doesn't work properly. Sometimes it recognizes your face and sometimes it doesn't

This is my first Samsung mobile i ever buy and worse product I ever buy. Plz don't be mislead by 64mp quad cameras and 6000amh battery. Fast charging literally doesn't work it took almost 2hours to get 100% charge with 15w charger . Front camera is worse camera but with update it get little better. we can't turn on flast while wide angle photo It is not even week since I bought , suddenly screen touch stop working , can't restart or do anything on it . Lying useless at moment . Shame on you Samsung .

I purchased this device on the very first day of it release, I purchased it for my Dad as he wanted a device which is simple enough to use with enough battery for everyday use and good camera to take pictures.
He is not a gamer nor he is a power user , thus looking at the criteria which he needed this phone was making all right ticks .
My dad is extremely happy with his purchase although when I have used the phone to just see how it is , I feel there are some software issues for example sometimes he says face unlock works sometimes it doesn't , which I believe is just a simple software fix .

On the next day of release i.e 6.3.2020 ,  I purchased Samsung M31 , as I was very impressed with M20.Samsung the " master in creating mobiles " in the intrest of public and to their taste.
  My order was honoured and sent the phone within 3days.Now Iam enjoying the great phone suitable to my purse.
No heating in playing and recording videos.Thrillig sound output ..What more I need..I recommend to my friends to own a beautiful phone..

Pros and Cons compare to other mobiles in the same budget

Pros.
1. Awesome Display
2. Battery Excellent
3. Build quality is OK
4. Camera (both front and back) is good ( not comparing with flagship mobile cams )
5. Speaker sound quality is decent
6. One UI is OK but it could have been better
7. Processor is good and with 6GB RAM it's performance is smooth

Cons.
1. No back cover out of the box.
2. 15w charger is enough for 6000mah battery
3. Camera (both front and back) in low light is not up to the mark
4. There are few issue with software for example, sometimes unable to send SMS, Samsung customer took remote access but unable to find reason.
hope these software issues will be fixed soon with future updates

Over all - it is a value for money.

I was thinking of purchasing a  budget phone for a long time and i searched a lot and at last i ordered samsung galaxy m31. It is the best budget phone under 17k price range. It has a massive battery and it is enough for 1.5 day for a mild user. The games like lubg also run smooth. The camera is just fantastic. If u are looking for a  budget phone blindly go for it.

Good with some serious trouble

Good phone but BEWARE....
(1) The front facing does not look like it's 32 MP.
(2)The BATTERY is NOT NOT NOT good. It drains off in 12 hrs flat heavy use. But even if you use it with ease it doesnt seem to stretch to 24 hrs.
SAMSUNG's claims seem to be not correct about battery.

Decent phone for the price.

The camera and display are excellent.  I am absolutely fine using a regular fingerprint reader , as midrange indisplay fingerprint reader sucks in midrange samsung phones.
Battery life is decent,  you csn leave a lot of things turned on.
The phone takes a lot of time to boot up , not sure why.
Charging is pretty slow compared  other quick charging Samsung phones.

More than value for money.

I was a Samsung C9pro user for past 3 years , the migration to M31 was pretty easy with smart switch, other than few credit card apps none of the  other apps recognise the move, face unlock it works and it doesn't, phone battery stays for one and half day with dual SIM,  figner print scanner improved a lot, camera is also better with correct light, phone casting to TV is not crashing , however  photo quality when we view on a 4k TV is not great, android auto also much stable, Bluetooth connectivity with both smart watch and car works seamlessly.

Awesome smartphone

The best ever decision qas to purchase this budget Smart phone with extraordinary battery capacity.
I have never expected the amazing Performance of Samsung phones of this price range.
The performance of this phone is ultimate matching near to its S series phones.
Battery is awesome...its range for me is 18hrs in one charge.
Camera performance is out standing.
Fingerprint is instant.
Overall best offer by Samsung.
Thanks to Samsung for launching such a wonderful budget Smart phone.

Best option in lower mid range phones

After a months use I will highly recommend this phone to all heavy users. The camera and battery are two of the best pros to buy this mega monster. Screen is awesome and clearly visible in bright sunlight. One very important benefit is that when you connect the phone to computer for taking photos or files from your phone, its very easy to find the files or photos from phone memory, whereas its a nightmare to find your data on most of the Chinese brands. Its the best option out there, so dont try any other Chinese phones but buy Samsung Galaxy M31.

It worth the price

I really like the camera. The battery life was very good .It took me around 2 days to completely discharge the battery.The amoled screen was like cherry on the top of cake .They only complain I have is there is a minor lag in viewing the picture after taking a snap .It takes a pause of 2-3 sec which was bit unusual for me because  the phone performance was very good and  It is very fast . The other thing is there is no stabilization in macro mode and the night mode is pretty good  (it's  not very good ).Ignoring these minor defects  ...the phone is all in all very good .I'm satisfied  with it.The delivery by Amazon was fast and the phone was neatly  packed .

Giving review after Using it for two days.  Recieved the phone with 49% charge and it lasted over 7 hours with continuous use. So yes the battery is massive.

Here are some pros, some average features and some cons I experienced in two days of rigorous usage.

Pros-

1. Superrrrr Battery-  Today I charged my phone to 100% and it's been more than 4 hours of continuous use and the battery is still 75%. The Monster battery of 6000mah Is by far the USP of Galaxy M31 and the reason why I bought this smartphone.

2. The Stunning and beautiful super Amoled Display- OMG I can't emphasize on how gorgeous the display is. After watching on this super amoled screen, every other display of laptop, TV, other phones look out dated.

3. One UI 2.0 - the UI of M31 is amazing. It is simple yet so satisfying. This is hands down the best UI in any smartphone.

Average features-
1. Gaming - I'm not a heavy or pro gamer but played pubg and Gareena free fire for a little while for testing. The games do take a little while to open thanks to dated exynos 9611 but there's no significant lag while playing and average players will have no issue playing Games in this smartphone. Not to mention the super amoled screen makes graphics look stunning.

2. Camera-  Both front and back camera in this smartphone are good but not 64mp or 32mp good. However The quality is amazing considering the Samsung brand name and budget price tag. On a positive note HD videos can be made in this smartphone so you can stop taking your DSLR everywhere.

3. Also has Dolby atmos feature. I did use it while using YT music but found no difference. Maybe it requires better quality headphones to experience or is just useless.

4. The phone does look good but fails to give premium look. Back panel is plastic instead of glass something redmi note 8 has. However I always use cover so not an issue for me.

5. 6 GB RAM - the Ram is 6 GB yet only 3 gb is ever free. Rest of the 3 gb is gobbled up by the heavy OS and bloatware.

6. McAfee antivirus - McAfee antivirus is preloaded but I have annual subscription of Avast ultimate so kind of useless to me.

Cons-
1. No cover provided within the box.
2. No headphones provided.
3. No Samsung secure folder.
4. Fingerprint scanner is a little bit higher. I'm currently having difficulty getting used to it.
5. The charging pin Is wider so can't use one charger for all purposes and can't use data cable with other smartphones.

Verdict- My biggest priority while buying a budget smartphone was a Massive battery, premium display, above average Camera, average gaming and samsung brand name. And Galaxy M31 doesn't disappoint at all.  It's a well spent money from my side. If your priorities are same as mine then go for it. üëç

Slow smart phone
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars

Phone is very slow because of the custom OS of Samsung, press lock button and it takes half a second to lock the screen, gets hanged too, not worth the price. Battery takes long to charge. Compared to other smartphone in the same price range, it's not worth buying unless you want phone with long battery life and the brand name.

Battery Beast , Ace Camera but still needs to be more grommed

I buyed phone on sale day 2 and received next day that , what I liked about the phone is battery Backup and Camera features rest things are pretty common like other competitors phone. Software is much better and impressive display in this segment.

Cons:
Volume is very low on call
Face recognition  could be improved
Lags and gets little heat up while heavy gamimg.
Fast charging is not fast may be because of bigger battery 6000mah

Couldn't surpass Realme Note 5Pro

The Camera  performance though  boasts a 64 MP rear camera and 32MP selfie camera fall short of the quality of  pictures &amp; videos  when compared to my other mobile pictures which is  Realme Note 5pro &amp; has 48MP rear camera. I failed to understand how Samsung could fall short to Realme even when boasting higher  specs.  Not satisfied with M31

Monster phone! I have been using this for over a week now.
Pros
Very good camera
Amazing battery life
Beautiful screen quality
No lag
No heating
Calling clarity, signal reception and wifi is perfect.
Cons-
Could have given a non plastic back or at least a matte finish so that finger print smudging is avoided.

Loved the phone at such a price. Will be a monster killer for other budget phones.

Best product at best price point

Excellent product by Samsung at this price point. Worth every penny you spend. 64mp camera is awesome, it really takes some stunning photos. SAmoled screen is crisp and clear. Battery performance for moderate usage for someone like me can work 2days.
I am using Redmi note 7 pro from last 1 year, but this is certainly best in terms of performance as compared to Mi phones.
Finger print reader is also fast. The SAR value of this phone is also very low (0.3) as compared to other high value phones. Without any doubts this is the best budget phone right now in the market.

The Samsung galaxy M31 is the best phone to buy under Rs.20.000 I purchased the samsung brand after gap of 2 years. The phone is worth buying for the following reasons.(after using for 3 days).
1.Camera quality.(both front and back camera are awesome)
2.Fingerpoint reader and face reader works very fast.
3.The 6000mah Monster battery works for two days easily even for heavy user
4.The super amoled screen in this price range is great.
I strongly recommend this phone to all the buyers.
Thank you SAMSUNG

Excellent  phone and very much satisfied with the features of the phone.  The camera is too good and battery life is awesome. This proven again as Samsung is best in its quality.  The camera inbuilt AI features are very helpful and easy to use.  Overall I taken the right decision choosing this phone and that too with so many features within the reasonable budget.  I do recommend to my friends to go ahead buy this phone.  I also appreciate Amazon service who delivered this phone with in agreed time.

Bad mobile network and system process software

I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day. Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes.
I expect this might be software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.
Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me. Plz no bay this mobile

Definitely a great midranger phone to own.

5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
The camera is very good in the price range. I likes the feature of best shot as well as AR emojis. The camera does well in low light also.
Coming to the battery part, it takes a while to charge however it has a big battery and it really lasts easily for two days.
I am not much a fan of finger print reader however that does not bother much.
Overall its a great package bundled with almost everything needed in a normal smartphone i.e. nice camera, great battery, clean UI, and samsung branding on the top. What else one need?
The only cons I think is it doesn't have NFC and therefore unable to use samsung pay on this. But that is manageable considering UPI payments.

A complete value for money premium Quality phone

5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
A very awesome mobile, a complete  value for money.
Main highlights are its awesome display, battery and performance.
One can argue with the performance when u take gaming into account. But believe  me even in gaming its performance  is awesome.
Its a daily life phone, awesome super amoled display for entertainment ,6000MAH battery for continuous work and decent performance.

The thing i dont liked that much...
1. Camera pic output...some are good some are not natural, its seems artificial.
2. No fast charging support..it takes nearly 2hr 45 mins to charge it completely.

These are not major negatives about this phone if compare at the price its been offered.

GO AHEAD FOR IT.....üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç

Best in smooth processor.
With 64 mp camera, quadcore camera setup is good and macro photography is best.
No problem of overheating while using or charging.
Fast charging is good.
Totally a best phone with the price.

Fingerprint reader is awesome both in its view and working.
Camera quality isnt as we can say 64 mp but the wide angle it creates and captures is awesome. Selfie camera is thumbs up.
Baterry life was the primary thing i went for and in this range this battery pickup is great.
The touchscreen, smooth touch, sleek and classy look is more than the price.
No heating problem, no hanging problem, bit of network connectivity problem probably due to the operator.
I would have given 4 straightaway. But .5 is to be added for the low price range and .5 is to be cut for the not so 64 camera quality. So i go with 4.5*

Editing the review since camera results are very poor. Too much smudges and noises and looks like either faulty product or incorrect advertisement regarding camera specs.

Well crafted product, but very poor camera quality
Pros -
good picture quality
Nice display
Biometrics is faster
Blue color on the back looks classy
Good batter life

Cons-

Given the specifications found the performance a bit lacking

Overall a good phone for the given price range

I never had a bad experience but this is the bad choice , I choosed to buy samsung m31 phone. Bad experience. Main problem is too badly got heat back camera part and when you will make a call same back portion will vibrant. And also company given 6gb ram when you play online games , games will lack too badly. Maybe companies fault . Lots friends said after samsung is not a. Good phone for roughly use. This is ladies phone. Really I am agry for this. I got lots of problems. Even I didn't go for return coz from the next day lockdown also started.

Really a MEGA MONSTER

DISLIKES:
I ordered the phone on sake day at 1 PM with delivery on the same day.
But Samsung shocked me by giving defective product
  Defects:
No sound will be produced by the phone in any of the below ways:
-headphone audioJack not working
-caller audio receiver not working
-speaker not working

Videos won't be played in the normal speed.It will only play at 2√ó speed.

Being the Samsung user in the form of TV,bluetooth neckband and mobiles for many years.I am upset in receiving the defective product on the opening day.Hope they will be taking care of quality control.

LIKES:
Replacement accepted and there comes the mega monster.Excellent performance with RAM Management,battery and  camera.

Samsung interface provides seamless usage.After receiving the quality product I even forgot about the bad first impression  created.

WHO can Buy:
-Camera is priority
-Wants some bigger battery
-day to day regular usage
-Normal gamers.Gaming performance is good.Any game can be played,but not at very very high configuration.

For this price,other Chinese products may assure more specs but the brand value decides the mobile life.Think wisely

PHONE WONT' SATISFY:
-Gamer addicts.But you can look for A71.
-onscreen finger print sensor-A51

Now I have recommended the phone in my friend's circle too.
For this price,this is a real mega monster.

REVIEW is about positive's and negative's.
Samsung should have eye on negative points keenly and that should be helping them to overcome the barrier.

Hope,I will be getting the JBL headphone for my review and Samsung won't betray me in this by giving the prize to positive reviewer'süòÅ

Best Mobile From Samsung

Best Mobile from Samsung I Purchased on First Sale from Amazon, In Just Rs:16000/ You get A Samsung Mobile with 128 GB of Internal Storage, 6GB RAM &amp; 6.4 Inch Super Amoled Screen.
Best part of it Mega Moster 6000 Mah Battery first from any Mobile Co.
You can buy this Mobile without second thaught. I m enjoying 3 day of Battery life on moderate use.
Thank Brand Samsung n Amazon quickly delivered to me within 12 hours.

This is honest review after 10 days of use. The phone looks promising with the features detailed in website. I am using 6 gb + 128 gb space black varient
Pros:
1)super display- super amoled brings viewing experience to next level.
2)mega battery- enough for full day heavy usage. People who are interested more in social media browsing, its a major advantage. You need not to worry for battery backup as this phone has a power bank inside.
3) amazing camera- camera quality is just awsome. 64 mp camera adds life to images.
4) samsung assurance - this product has samsung brand value and id supploes with high quality finish and long lasting durability
5) no heating issue- even if you use phone for hours you would not feel any heating at the back.
Cons:
1) slow charging - even though samsung claims to have equipped the device with fast charging then also actually phone take close to 1.5 hours for full charge from 30 % to 100%. This might be due to large battery size proportionaly making charging time to increase.
2) missing led notification- though its not a major thing to note but could add value if provided.
3) As claimed , processor is not blazing fast, though this phone is great for day to day useage but gamers may feel little disappointment while playing high resolution games.

Overall its a great budget phone for modrate users and media lovers.

Don't buy!!!

Don't buy. Not worth 15k. Worst camera. Phone is getting warm for normal usage(not even playing games). You cannot return this after buying. Amazon will tell stories instead of refunding.
Amazon technician is not visiting on time and it's very frustrating after paying 15 k for this nonsense piece. Farid amazon.

One of my best Samsung....
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I had previously used Note 5, S8, and Note 9 before switching to M31. Foremost reason was massive battery life, which has proved right.

Forget daily charging. Even with heavy use, phone will be on for more than 2 days without any charging.

Rest are too perfect... camera for daily use, looks, balance, screen vividness...

Finally do not go for Vivo or Xiomi or Realme etc. Buy this phone and never regret.
-----
Charging the massive battery is a big problem
-----
3.0 out of 5 stars
-----
The best thing about this phone is not its battery but the display. And the most acclaimed battery (and its charger) is a dissappointment because it takes 3 hours to completely charge. Who has 3 hours to keep the phone for charging? Samsung should have provided a faster charger that could charge the phone in an hour and a half at the max, and a 15min dash to charge it 30 /35 percent. Apart from this the phone is great. Even now, Samsung can come up with a fast charger and people would buy it as per the recommendation instead of going for some other company charger which may damage the phone or its battery. Moreover the completely charged phone is good to go for one and half day for moderate use.

Post 5 days usage of M31 review

5.0 out of 5 stars

At this price it will be a very good phone who has using other brands. Please find the below after using 5 days:
Pros:
1. Good camera quality, we can feel the change of picture.
2. Battery life is awesome as of now. It is giving more than a day.
3. Touch screen is very sensitive and I loved it while typing.
4. Automatic light mode, which is very  good option and it as acting as per need based on our adjustments on timely basis.
5. Optins wise also it has many features that we can enable  for the smart usage.
6. Quality of sound is awesome.... feel like we are in theater. Have DolbyAtmos option to change the sound effect. It depends on how you feel it.

Cons:
1. Vedio of the quality not that much  expected. Not sure there might  be some configurations. Not checked as of now.
2. Feeling little heat when we are on the sim card net. Also when we are on calls l, even this  also may be initially.

Finally with the above pros and cons we can buy it wth out comparing other products which are available on the market.
Thank you.

I had ordered this phone on the day of launch. I got it very next day .Appreciate the quick delivery by amazon. I have been using this phone since a week . It has been a really good experience so far.
Pros:
Battery life is really good and stays for a day without charging
Camera quality is amazing.
Smooth touch screen and quick response in  the UI
The UI part of Android 10 is quite amazing.
The sound quality is ok .
Finger print sensor is very effective.
Performance is really good.

Cons:
Sometimes phone gets heated up.
They could have given ear phones and a back cover .
The packaging by amazon was very average.

Almost perfect!

Almost everything is perfect!
‚Ä¢ The "best part" of it is its battery which lasts for almost 10 hours of heavy usage. Mediocre usage will last for like 1.5 days, ideal for long train journeys!
‚Ä¢ The camera quality is very good.
‚Ä¢ It stutters sometimes while heavy usage.
‚Ä¢ Google Due video calling was a bit laggy.
‚Ä¢ Don't know about gaming performance as I don't use it for gaming purpose.
‚Ä¢ 128GB feels like you don't need any storage device anymore. It's like you have your work related each and every thing in your pocket.
‚Ä¢ Experience of viewing videos at night in an amOLED screen is blissfull.

UPDATE: I hate this phone... how can a phone just crash and reboot lying on the table without being used? This *NEVER* happened with my Motorola G5 Plus!

======================================================================================
Looks surprisingly thin. But not great. Samsung UI is ok, but not great. Lots of bloatware.. some I could uninstall, but some I couldn't. Installed Microsoft Launcher over the Samsung UI.

Took some photos.. it didn't stand out. Though I need to take more photos to judge.

The one thing which I absolutely HATE is the position of the single speaker.... it's just where I usually place my right pinky finger to hold up the phone. And this drowns out the sound of the video. It's very important to buy a phone with dual speakers.. preferably one that is at the top.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated after more than a month of usage:
- The phone heats up during charging.
- It has crashed and rebooted 2-3 times while in the middle of something.
- Low light videos are TERRIBLE.
- Compass calibration keeps going wrong. Every time I have to use it, I need to re-calibrate it.
- Speaker is not good at all. Part of the reason is the placement. My 3 year old Moto G5 Plus was much better.

I wish I had bought the Redmi Note 9 Pro :(

I have been loyal Samsung user for years now. This one works smooth but trying to get used to its screen length. Camera works fine. I haven't noticed any difference between normal cam mode and 64mp mode, but both are fine. Macro lens version is to be simply admired. Slow motion works well too. Overall it's a good phone. I am satisfied.

Good for the price, but not for the specifications

Battery life and RAM performance is very good, but the USP - 64MP main camera and other 3 cameras do not perform to the specifications. No portrait mode so no 3D photos on FB. Even the 64MP main camera fails to capture details and objects blur on zooming in - not at all expected. Macro camera does some good work, but not able to capture details required for a macro photo. Wide angle camera and live focus are just good enough. Night mode is not so impressive. Overall, average camera gives average rating for the otherwise good phone.

Definitely value of money it is.
Ppl who are criticizing about the bad performance or poor camera , stop being a cry baby and STOP FRETTING ... Great fone within this budget WTH u guys expecting
Firstly not a big fan of Samsumg but this is some real gold guys.  great performance and camera is good too.. tho is not good for those who want to play hardcore games 24x7 ... obviously the battery and performance will degrade soon if such games played for long.. GO FOR IT..

This was definetely a great upgrade from Samsung for me as I have been a customer since last 5 years.
Highlights for me
1.Macro camera-It capture pictures with every minute details.
2.64 MP camera-This is something next level as images were size more than 8 mb according to lighting conditions which is equivalent to dslr sizes and detailng is also crystal clear here.
Moreover the Monster Battery that stands out over all of these  6000mah,once full charge in the morning can easily run for 2 days.
 Loved it.

Awesome device. The One ui is filled with lot of features .The camera and battery 6k mah is best.Camera quality is sharp with better detailing,good dynamic range.Must buy it.Selfie camera Sensor sony (imx616) is great.The 5mp macro shots are better.Built quality is better than m30s.The camera is far far better than any other brand phone in this price.But the back side can be easily  scratched so its better to use a case or vinyl.Battery lasts approx  2 days without using internet.

I came to Samsung galaxy M31 straight from using Samsung J7 pro in few days, so it felt like shedding an extra layer of skin which is lighter and more manageable with a soft touch over its screen. Its extremely well balanced and easy to hold and navigate with one hand. Display which feels like absolute best of all words - beautiful colors, perfect viewing angles, incredible 6000mAh battery etc. I would recommend trying both and seeing whether usage allows you to maintain a high fresh rate because its absolutely worth it.

Pro :
ui Is good
Battery life is good
Samsung has good display.
Calling  bluetooth , sound, wifi , everything good.
Camera is okay not that bad. Not that great cant find that 64 mp feel

Cons :
Phone is sometimes slow even for basic games u can find that crispyness literally
Switching between tabs is slow
Fingerprint at back is at wrong placement .. not that friendly
Face reader litwrally sucks. Cant identify faces all the time. Doesnt work in the dark. Obviously this is not apple.

Check for my pics taken from this phone.

Monster in Power but worst in camera

3.0 out of 5 stars

I bought the phone for the sole purpose of processing power and camera. Processing power is really great and so does the 6000mAh battery. But camera is really disappointing. You expect 64MP AI camera to match the standards but it performs really poor, even worse than my Samsung galaxy A70(2018) with 32MP camera. They should look more closely in building cameras. Phone has lag for some of the heavy apps but it eventually nullify soon you start using it daily. I would say if you are buying this phone for camera then DON'T please

Heating problem and touch screen problem

2.0 out of 5 stars
-----
It is very disappointing that phone has heating issue. On simple use you will feel the heat and once you have played any game then it is like old iron. It is heat the upper part of phone i.e. camera side.

On the other hand screen stuck while using whatapps. Screen touch start working abnormal. I have brought  2 handsets i feel similar  issues in both of the handsets.

I am not a tech bug but second phone user has raised concern  to amazon they have ask to install diagnostic  software  after that i have no idea what they have done to his handset.

Firstly I was impressed by the delivery of the phone it was in my hand in just 10 hours after I book the phone in Amazon. Great job from Amazon.
Coming to M31, Really it's a monster. Unfortunately It got slipped from my hand on day 1 itself from 3ft but there is no scratch in the screen and there is only a minor rash on side panel. The battery was a beast and gives pretty good enough time to use the phone for long time. Camera was nice and overall phone performance was awesome. Really good product  from SAMSUNG.

Great Phone in this price range. Amazing battery. Although charging speed is slow, but once it charges, it does not doe easily. In this lockdown, while i am almost every hour on phone, it still gives me 1-1.25 days of backup which is amazing. Once the lockdown ends, i might get more than 2 days on medium usage. On heavy usage, i am easily getting 1.25 days of battery with SOT of more than 10 hours.

Amazing camera and amazing one ui. The UI is very rich with features.

Overall, I would recommend you to buy this phone with your eyes closed. No Redmi / Realme phone will give you so much confidence than this.

Thank you Samsung. :)

Pros.
Super Amoled Screen. Immersive Experience to watch movies.
Battery Last for more than 24 hrs continous usage. Take 2 hrs 30 minutes to fully charge from 0 to 100%
Fingerprint &amp; faceunlock are fast.
Camera. Only 64mp back &amp; selfie camera are good &amp; capture detailed &amp; sharp images.
Samsung UI is lag free Smooth &amp; with Zero Ads.

Cons. No Cons so far...

I have moved down from note 8 which i bought for 64 thousand 2 years back, from amazon. I purchased this for 16 thousand. I was expecting a major downgrade but i am happy to share that the user experience is just as good. The battery impresse me and i am astounded that samsung delivered the same screen quality that i had on the note 8. Camera is decent but i am comparing it to a note so my expectations are high. The weight distribution is so good that it feels much better to hold than to hold a note 8. I have used it tocplay call of duty mobile and it works well with medium settings.

I dont think you can get better value for money at this price and that too with service support of a behemoth like samsung.

One of the best options in the segment.
I preferred this phone for its sAMOLED display  and I am very happy  with it's look and performance.  To my surprise software one UI is smooth performing and practical.  Samsung's galaxy M series has been trustworthy brand against many aggressive competitors. Packaging and charger design could have been better. Anyhow satisfied with choice.

ANOTHER BLOCKBUSTER FROM SAMSUNGüëçüëçüëç
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
This is my 5th samsung phone and following are the pros and cons for this product.
Pros:-
Build quality:-2.5/5 yeah most of it is polycarbonate which feels little lighter on side but it is better than glass back for those who use phone roughly it eliminates the rust of breaking.
Style:- 5/5 yeah it's samsungüëç
Performance:- 4/5 yeah it is a monster üëç
Camera:-5/5 superb it is,üëç
Battery:-5/5 two days on the goüëç
Display:-5/5 i love samsung s-amoledüëçüëç
Fingerprint sensor:- 5/5 lightining fast
Face unlock:- 5/5 lightining fast
CONS-
polycarbonate looks like plastic.
Processor is little dizzy for hardcore gamers
Physical Fingerprint sensor is a bit outdated now a days.
Polycarbonate back is plain and fingerprint magnet.

Very nice smartphone in budget
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
The king of its segment
-----
Best buy for an average consumer for media consumption, watching youtube, and streaming services online...
The screen alone makes it worth of buying as it's way way better than the panels on its competition.
The camera quality is great and even better than the competition.
Battery life deserves a mention wherein for a heavy user, you won't be left searching for charges... it easily lasts one full work day without needing to be charged.
Fingerprint scanner could be better positioned but its fast which is great.

Gaming would be slightly compromised when compared to its competitors, but I dont think an average user would notice it, because the screen has wonderful color accuracy and contrast

Overall the best purchase in this price range.

Immense battery life, quad camera setup and great display!
-----
I've got the 6GB+128GB variant and thanks to early access and Prime Delivery experience....
Pro:
1. The first thing that you notice is that the mobile feels pretty lightweight for a 6000mAh battery pack with impressive performance.
2. The 6.4inch FHD+ SAMOLED panel -  best display in the price range.
3. Versatile rear quad camera setup and front facing camera with very decent image quality, great video performance under daylight.
4. Refined One UI 2.0 with Android 10 out of the box makes the device snappy to use and.
5. The physical rear finger print scanner works pretty fast, accurate and even when the finger is wet.
6. RAM management is quite good and storage provided is great which can also be expanded upto 512GB.
7. Price.

Cons:
1. The same Exynos 9611 chipset from it's predecessor M30s is a decent processor and it handles the day to day tasks pretty well but the mobile feels under-powered for some reason. But at this price tag a Snapdragon 712 or 730 SoC chipset would be make this mobile an aggressive one.
2. The camera performance under low-light conditions is poor and makes the image look smooth lacking details. Same in the case of zooming into the subject during daylight. And again this is the only downside for such a good camera setup.

My experience with this mobile is quite satisfactory so far and I would recommend buying this mobile. Also use a case and tempered glass for drop protectionüôÇ.

4. Full marks ro 64MP quad camera.

Amazing phone with great battery life.
-----
I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks now and I must say that I am very much impressed. The camera quality is just amazing. Even in low lights, the picture quality is amazing. The screen is always been a usp of Samsung phones and this phone screen lives upto the expectations. Battery life is simply amazing. For me it goes thru the second day with almost 4 to 5 hours of gaming, 2 to 3 hours of internet surfing and calls as well. Fingerprint sensor is pretty good as well. I have not experienced any lag while using the phone and switching between different apps is smooth. Overall a nice phone in such great price.

having 6000mAh battery , backup is only 24hrs on use so....shame on battery backup
secondly, upermost part gets heated time to time
and thirdly, face lock sensor is bit slow , camera is ok'ish and no back case inside the box
so overall at this rate i.e @16000 one should never look for this phone and plzz buyers don't go on the specification provided plzzz...i went but!!
BATTERY BACKUP IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE !!!!
CAN'T BELIEVE specially from Samsung

I prefer Samsung than any Chinese brand mobile because I believe it's more reliable and trusted brand.
M31 is having good display, camera is good, and awesome battery backup. Only  issue I found with this mobile is it takes a long time to charge about 2 hours, so having 6000mAh is not effective unless you keep it at charge on night (the reason for 4 star).
-----
M31 justifies its cost.
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars

Battery life is better than others but still it cannot stand for two days with regular internet usage.
Camera is quality is great.  But using wide angle view stretches the image and distorts the faces as well .
Big space makes life easier.
Fingerprint sensor could be more sensitive.
Just missed a wow review due to little things but Overall this mobile justifies its cost.

I have been using this phone for almost 3 months and I have a mix review to this phone.
It is in good competition with redmi phones in this price range, however yet again samsung has failed in phone hang issue. This phone in 3 months has already hangs a lot. (I dont play any heavy game on this phone and have limited apps and data).
Fingerprint sensor is a area of improvement. Sensitivity is low.
Battery is good....
Camera is also good....
Overall average experience...

Really amazing phone  after 4days of use . Samsung is best in battery 6000 mah .  every  time I use to carry power bank for charging.  Now no tension , no power bank, and no charger.
Comes to display : really I am very  happy  for dispay  with low budget I got amoled display.

For this specification: other phones are 18k +

Handson experience after 10 days.
Really disappointing product from Samsung. This is utlra hyped product. Its a marketing stratagy of samsung to promote it. Only battery is the feature of the phone which last around 1.5 days on heavy usage. i am a game freak and it is good for that.
The camera is pathetic mark my word pathetic its a 8 megapixel camera which they branding as 64 megapixel. when you zoom after cl8cking a photo there is no details. its all blurred out and you feel cheated like anything. the selfie camera sucks. Overall experience is bitter. I really dont like the smartphone. it is all plastic body and quite compressable. I have oppo reno phone i felt it is 1000% guinine than this cheating phone. Be aware before you buy. 2 star is only for battrry only battrry.

Ok ok product...I don't know how people are giving so much rating for this product...
My review post 2 weeks of usage:
Pros:
Budget friendly
Nice camera with nice features.especially wide angle and slow motion.
Nice amoled display.
Battery is also ok.
Cons:front camera adding so many filters which I dont like...missing the natural picture die to these filters.camera specs dient match the quality of pictures.
Battery is taking around 3 hours from 0 to 100 which is too much time.at the same time draining in 1 and half days of modern usage.
Face lock is not smooth sometimes responding bit slow.
Very low sound comparative my any previous models whether its samsung series or redmi series.
Mobile also doesn't works seamlessly.taking 1 or 2 secs to open the app some times.

Finally so so product.and could be I expected too much from the config they mentioned abt.
-----
All in all better then average.

3.0 out of 5 stars

Speed of mobile is Good, no hanging, smooth gaming. For me Camera not up to the mark...as I earlier used Samsung note5 and 8mp of note5 is much better then this 64mp. Samoled is great. Finishing of the product is so not good....alignment of fitting lacks perfection. Camera holes alignment or side edge you can see poor craftsmanship.

Must read before buying. In depth review of Samsung Galaxy M31.
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Samsung has done a pretty good job in the mid range segment with it's M series of smartphones.

Display: Thanks to the S-OLED the display is crisp and clear with excellent viewing angles, better than any other non samsung phones in the mid range segment. Colour reproduction is excellent, but too sharp if set on vivid. You can set it to natural through display settings for more natural feel.
Rating: 5 of 5.

Battery: First ever phone containing a 6000 mah battery. Believe me it is a mammoth battery, It gives a day and half battery backup with medium use. Normal use can easily last for 2 days. Phone feels light knowing it has a mammoth battery. I have Asus Max pro M1 with 5000 mah battery feels heavy compared to Samsung M31.

Rating: 5 of 5

Performance: The Exynos 9611 does a pretty decent job in handling daily phone activities. It handles pubg well too. But mind it this is a midrange phone, considering this it's awesome on gaming part too. For pubg, on high settings the device gets a bit hot but that's normal since pubg uses a lots of hardware resources and some game lag here and there, but again it's ok at this price point.

Rating: 5 of 5

Sound: Sound is a taken care of a mono speaker on the bottom right of the phone, Not loud but ok enough. The placement of speaker is odd for me though as my hand comes over the speaker while in landscape mode for watching videos or movies. Sound through headphones is nice (depends on your headphones too). I have a House of Marley Smile Jamaica earphones and the sound produced is crystal clear.

Sound: 4 of 5

Camera: My god the rear cameras are excellent in good lights. You can zoom the picture taken to the point it can't be zoomed further and you will find no or negligible noise in the pictures. Front selfie camera does a decent job too. Can be better in low light as the pictures taken are noisy and grainy. This will be eliminated in further OTA updates (Hope so). Videos are excellent too. The camera app includes all features for tiktokers too.

Rating: 4 of 5.

Call Quality: The most important factor of a phone which is rarely reviewed, only one word "Excellent". No unusual sounds while on call through the earpiece, even when on loudspeaker you can hear the other person very well even if you have some disturbances around. Mic does an excellent job as well the person on other can hear you clearly.

Rating: 5 of 5

Storage: It depends on the variant you choose. I bought one with 6gb ram and 128 gb internal storage. Massive storage at this price. 6 gigs of RAM ( DDR4) helps you seamlessly multitask without any lags or reloads.

Rating: 5/5

Conclusion: A must buy mid range device that has all the features a smartphone user wants. Truly an all rounder device.

Really I am so impressed with the new Samsung M31 smartphone.I bought it from amazon and delivered it to me within time.Following are the reviews of this smarphones based on thier performance I used it during a month.

CAMERA:the quad rear camera is so good.The pictures which is captured is so clear and doesnt even blurred thtough zooming .The video i recorded is also of Full hd quality and seems to be recorded through high pixel digital cameras.

DISPLAY:The super amoled display of M31 is also do good.The crystal clear display enables me to use it effectively during bright sunshine unlike other smartphones.

BATTERY:The superb 6000 mah battery is so high Even after continuous use of 10 hours the battery drains a little .And fast charging enables this phone to charge fastly .

NETWORK CONNECTIVITY:Both sim support 4G connectivity and network strength capacity is also good.

FINGERPRINT SENSOR: This phone comes with a rear fingerprint scanner which allows me to unlock my phone less than a second and Face unlock id is also works good.

RAM And MEMORY: I bought 6Gb ram and 128 gb storage variant.I have played several games of high quality like Pubg but even not a single glitch observed during gaming.Also multiple apps opening at a same time doesnot hangs my handset.I have not observed any hanging problem until now.

SPEAKER:Sound quality is good and so loud such that we are even listen songs in loudspeaker in a huge crowd area.

WEIGHT AND DESIGN:This phone weight is not so high even it uses large 6000 mah battery.And I give it 5 star in its design .The large 6.4 inch screen it uses is so nice and I feels it so handy and carriable during walking,jogging or any other travelling.

Overall I gave this phone 5 star as it brings my life so easier and all my works which i used to do with laptop is now shifted to my new Samsung M31 smartphone.

THANKS TO SAMSUNG AND AMAZON for this great smartphone..

coming from a Samsung S7 Edge, I always wanted a phone with an awesome screen and a good battery life. This phone has them both. Its a bit heavier than the S7 Edge, but it is because of the 6000mah battery. My usage is average and I have never experienced and issue with his one. first charging I felt that the phone was heating but that has stopped after the first software upgrade. Awesome phone for a budget.

amazing handset in price segment, great features, most and important is don't want to by MI as its origin from Virus country, I feel my contribution towards India and exchange MI with this device.
I insist to all great Indians, never by from Virus country and replace or return if you own it.

Its almost 1 month since i bought this mobile. 1st impression is impressive... you cannot resist picking  it up again and again... check every angle.. every service. Every settings... its marvelous...

Camera is good for normal user... but for pro's i would not recommend it.. though you can work it out with little change in settings and here and there... autofocus is not that good but definitely not that bad too... fingerprint gives trouble sometime but other than that it works like a charm... the only issue i had it that samsung did not provide  a light border around it... so user could feel it and pace finger correctly.. the day it arrived.. i downloaded many application from microsoft word to evernote... whatsapp to skype pubG to candy crush... more the 150 app are there currently on my device but no issue of speed while switching 1 to another.. though it gets little heat up while playing pubG but not that much... and lo lagging  so far...
And above all boss 6000 mah battery... for normal user ... if you charge your phn 100% and in normal use taking phone calls.. texting chatting..listening music.. playing normal games... it last 70-75 % at the end of day... woooow...
I am not an high end user... and i am well aware about price range... so for me ints 4 out of 5... but for those who need everything perfect kindly incrrase your budget till 20k i must say m31 slay every predator around it.....

Initial impressions and basic user review of Samsung M31
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I bought the black 6GB/128GB variant a week ago and have been using this phone ever since. I'm happy with its performance in general, so far.

Few things which I feel require a quick mention:

1. Battery - Although the phone has a fast charging capability, my device takes roughly between 1.5 to 2.5 hours to completely charge, which is a bit disappointing, but the battery lasts easily for 24 hours so that's okay. Still disappointed about the slow charging bit.

2. Camera - The primary camera performs best in an outdoor lighting condition with a fairly decent color reproduction. The EIS for 1080p videos is good. The front-faced camera captures good pictures and records video decently in indoor lighting conditions. Didn't get to check it in an outdoor condition.

3. Other features - The build quality looks premium. The volume and the power buttons appears to be of good quality. The finger print sensor has a quick response time which is great. The touchscreen quality is indeed good. The OS operates well, I haven't noticed any lag so far. The dark mode is a welcome addition to this phone. Call quality is very good. The speakers are fairly loud given there's only 1 speaker grill at the bottom.

Overall, in my opinion M31 is a value for money phone from Samsung.

Real Monster. Good budget phone to buy.

After so much of research, I decided to go with M31 on the second day of launch. To my surprise, the phone matched my Expectations. Have to appreciate Amazon for the super fast delivery, I ordered it by night around 10pm and I got the phone delivered by next day morning 9am. Packing was good and safe.
I'm writing this mobile review based on my first 2 days experience with this phone. Will add later if there is anything.

Pros:
1. Very nice battery. It was coming roughly 2 days for a moderate usage in 4G.
2. Camera is very decent. Even though it doesn't justify 64mp, still I would say camera is good with clear pictures.
3. Display is too good
4. Phone is not very heavy and good to use
5. Voice clarity and signal is good
6. Looks very good and stylish too.

Cons:
1. Finger print is placed very high in the back, needs to stretch a bit to reach the sensor
2. Charging is very slow(I understand its 6000mah), roughly 2.5hrs, could have given charger with more watts.
3. Charging cable length is very short
4. No earphones provided with this mobile.
5. Speaker is not much loud as only one speaker is provided at the bottom
6. Has mild heat when we play high end games, but its not too heat also

Overall is a Good budget phone to buy.

Calls getting dropped.

1.0 out of 5 stars

Almost every call gets dropped after 20 to 30 seconds. On same SIM , other phones are working fine. So , its device problem.

Expected more on other side but not up to expectations. Over all rating a B- if calls drop issue is resolved, else its worthless.
-----
If your looking for a decent phone with good screen ,UI, Battery life go for it

Bought the m31 (6+128) both space black and ocean blue variants for me and my brother.here are my views about the device.
Pros:
1.Super amoled display which is more vibrant than IPS LCD pannels
2.Stunning blacks Thanks to the Samsung's SAMOLED DISPLAY.
3.Massive 6000 mah battery which lasts for around  1 and half to 2 based on our usage.
4.super user friendly thanks to samsung ONEUI 2.0 the interface is too Good.
5.come with android 10 out of the box.
6.The quad camera setup is decent enough and there is some auto focus issue which I think may be corrected with an update.
7.Decent performer for games like pubg,call of duty etc....
8.Always on display is very useful and get done the task of notification LED ofcourse there is some battery drain because of this feature.But trust me it is very less than you expected.

Cons:
1.supports 15W fast charging only which make the total charge time to around 2h 30 mins .but remember the capacity is around 6000mah which take more time to charge.
2.Design is too old as we are getting glass finish in other brands within this budget range.
3.Need improvement in the speed of unlocking phone using biometrics.

Fantastic phone in this price range. Overall its a very good smartphone. The sAMOLED screen is very sharp and clear. Fingerprint sensor is very fast. Even face unlock works great even in low light. 6000 mah batery stands true to its word. I play pubg without any lag in hd quality and high frame rate. I am a medium user of phone and watches many videos . Still the battery lasts more than 1.5 days. The phone gives a very premium feel. The camera quality is just awesome. One cannot expect any better quality in this price range. I am delighted to be the user of this phone and recommend it to everyone. This phone is just mind blowing.

Awesome!!

I ordered this phone within few hours of launch, and was promptly delivered the very next day. Thanks to Amazon for on time delivery

I bought the ocean blue, 128 GB variant which is kind of dark blue and I really love the colour. I am no techie to review the phone on its technical aspects but as a common layman I truly love its performance since the 3 days I have been using it.

The set up  took really less time than I expected and it comes with Smart Switch App, which made the data transfer easy and smooth.

The pictures clicked from the phone are extremely good and nice, however I saw a flicker of light when I tried to take a slowmotion video. I am not sure if the flickering was because of the light or the issue was with the camera. but there was not such flickering while capturing a slowmotion video in daylight.

The battery back up seems to be amazing, Since 3 days I have charged it only once. (Other than the charging done on the first day for 3 hours). But the charging is not as fast, and I feel the 15V charger is not good enough for the 6000 MaH Battery

Overall I loved the phone it is smooth, fast and Vibrant.... and Im loving it

Pathetic product delivered, phone set delivered on 16th March &amp; i have gifted it on 23rd March, when the phone is switched on, phone touch not working, keypad not working, so many time requested for replacement, Amazon least bothered to acknowledge it, nor I have got confirmation for replacement, when we call customer care they say lock down, understand , my question is why amazon not accepting requests for replacement, I have requested for replacement( on 23r March 2020 )  before return window closed ( I e on 26th March 2020)

Very good handset in the budget of 17k that to from a brand like Samsung. i was using Galaxy A7 before to this mobile and other than thickness and few features like on-screen notifications and PIP features are missing. But Battery performance wise \ camera &amp; Display wise makes this mobile on upper hand side.

for thoose who are camera lovers and brand freakers can choose this mobile without any worries.

A totally worth buy mobile from Samsung. The game changing features are the Awesome Camera and the Extraordinary Battery Life. Carrying a 6000mah battery, this phone is way lighter in comparison of other phones with the same battery.

As for the gaming performance, I didn't face any issue while playing heavy games like PUBG and Modern Combat 5.

The 6 gb ram and the Exynos 9611 processor performs very well with multi tasking and many other things.

The Night Mode, the wide angle mode, and the Super slomo mode are the features that I loved the most in the camera.

To conclude, Its the best smartphone according to me at this price point.
-----
Not a worthy one. Find a nearby service center before purchasing

I brought it on the first day(March 5) it was released and seems good but after software upgradation it went for error.

You cannot switch on/off your mobile...Ot will show an error message if you put charge and it go off after the battery hot fully drained....

I gave it samsung service center on 13th june 13 after the lockdown still they are working on it first week they said they are awaiting patches from Samsung second week they said mother board has to be changed and this week i dont know what they are going to say....

I gave it for wife as a gift but she blames  that i haven't choosen a worthy one...

I haven't used the mobile more than a month and it's surprise to hear a new mobile not even a Month old got mother board problem this shows the quality of the mobile...

Most frustrating thing is none will your call they have land line and mobile number...If your fortunate they may answer you call after you continuously call them more than 50 times....

If you want to put yourself in trouble by your hard earned money then you have to choose this mobile....

Overall for me it is a wonderful product by Samsung based on the price. Getting all this features in this price range is just awesomeüëçüëç
I would give Pro's and Con's that I felt after my use of 15 days

Pros:
1) Wonderful design
2) Superb battery life
3) AmOled display is amazing
4) Camera is also good
5) Fingerprint reader as given on the back is a plus for me bcz I have seen many on screen fingerprint reader going numb.. So this is having it at the back and it's just amazing.
6) Headphone jack is avaliable
7) Fast charging is really fast üòâ

Cons:
1) Phone heats up quickly while charging and when used continuously for above 30-35 mins
2) The touch could have been a little more smoother i.e. Less resistive
3) User Interface is quite complex, took 2-3 days to completely get aquanted with it

Average product, don't expect S20 quality. Battery is good
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) is an average low mid range product for a reasonable price. It is as fast as my Galaxy S7, but not as fast as S20. Please don't buy this phone expecting to be flagship Galaxy S20. You get what you pay for. No complains so far.

The Good:
1) Finger Print Reader is good - unlocks in 1 to 1.5 seconds
2) Battery Life is good - 1.5 days of usable

The Average:
1) Camera is average, please don't expect it to deliver S20 Quality Pictures, remember, you have paid 1/3 of S20 price.

The Ugly:
1) Bloatware from Google &amp; Samsung
-----
Great budget phone with amazing configuration. Go for this phone with Good brand name &amp; specs

Pros:
1. Phone looks neat and premium finish.
2. Fits perfectly in your hand.
3. Camera quality is decent enough for the price paid.
4. Battery back up is good. Lasts for full day with heavy usage. For a normal user easily it will go for 1.5 days.
5. Touch is super smooth and super amoled is really great.
6. Sound clarity is good.
7. Finger touch sensor works perfect.
8. Face recognition is nice.
9. Super configuration in this price. No lagging or hanging issue.

Cons:
1. No back cover, screen guard in the box.
2. Heats up if map is continously on.
3. Night mode camera quality is not upto the mark.

It's a winner!!

This mobile is one of the best in its price range. Firstly, the battery is rock solid. At 6000 mah, it comes for more than one and a half day's usage for a hard user like me. The display is kickass and the other features like finger print sensor and face recognition works fast too. On the design front, M31 looks like an identical twin of M30s except for the camera module which houses 4 lenses.

The quad cam is good for daylight shooting. In the night, it does feel that Samsung could've done better. But again, considering the price range and other features packed in the phone, its forgivable, I would say. The charging is quite slow because of the 6000 mah battery.

This is my third day with the phone and wrt to the first impression, I can say that this phone is a winner. If your are planning to buy one, I would recommend you to buy the 128 GB version. Hardly 1000 bucks more than the 64 GB version. But with the amount of photos and videos you are gonna shoot with this superb camera, I am sure you would want to have more memory.

Using this mobile for  almost 2 months now. Just before lockdown i bought it and it started hanging within a week so i wasn't able to place an exchange or return order complaint. The battery life is also very less as compared to other mobile phones I've used. Plus it mentions 6000mah which it definitely not at all acceptable. Also it starts to heat up pretty quickly and then you'll not be able to use your phone for another 30 mins. Not at all satisfied with the product.

This phone for its price is best in class. While Chinese phones may pack more features but Samsung is clearly a class apart.

It has the best fingerprint reader which is blazing fast.

The camera is excellent at the price point and the AR feature is a new addition that is quite fun.

The battery life is awesome. With a 6000 mAh battery it will always last a full day and then some more.

It charges quickly even though it has a large battery thanks to the included fast charger.

The screen is the best at the given price point with crisp and vivid images.

The phone is snappy with zero lag. It runs smoothly.

The fact that it can support dual Sims and an SD Card without any glitches and the fact that you don't have to decide between having two sim cards or one sim and an SD card is excellent.

The gesture controls are handy and call quality is excellent.

All in all this is completely worth the money. At this price point you simply can't get a better phone

Personally I loved Galaxy series, the Make in India products...
Features :
* With normal usage, the phone lasted over 2 days and you don‚Äôt need to carry a power bank with you anymore.
* Super AMOLED display is great and highly customizable with detailed colors.
* Fingerprint &amp; biometric are pretty quick
* Battery life is exceptional for this device 6000maH , lasts 2days with ease (minimal gaming)
* * Cameras are whole new chapter, high resolution cameras capture shots with huge detail...
Whats more interesting are the AReality support for this device...(in core)
* Even Flashlight has modes of brightness which is pretty useful...

Overall this is a great device at this price range supported by Samsung's best apps and customization...
Its a beast in performance, battery and camera...

Fingerprint Senser is great, it sense just in once. Battery life last for 11 hour when use randomly. Amoled display gives u a great fun while u watch any video. No lack between game and working. I love the product if u are searching a phone under 15000 u should buy samsung galaxy m31 6Gb with 64GB ROM. Features are amazing with new features and extra features than other phones under 15000rs. Camera quality is amazing with 64MP camera. It can help u read small words from a distance of 10m. Wide angle and macro shots are amazing. This phone is perfect in all fields in a very small price. Love u samsung for such nice product. Hope such new amazing products like this.

Pros:
1.Battery 6000 mAh- good to last for 2 days with moderate use. (I am not a gamer)
2. Camera- good at day light shots(front &amp; back). Definitely need improvement at low light conditions. Same camera performes better than this at Realme&amp; Redmi.
3.Display- Super Amoled- best
4. It does not feel too heavy even though with 6000 mAh battery.
5. Android 10- Samsung's One UI2. Latest with great GUI.
6. Finger print sensor- fast with great response.
Cons:
1.Exynos 9611 processor - average. Not meant for gamers.
2. Plastic back.
3. Charging- ~2.5 hrs to fuel the battery full
4.Focus hunting- While recording video camera struggles to focus. You feel it only when viewed on big screens.

Pretty Decent features in a reasonable price range...
Camera is good but not exceptional, don't expect iPhone X clarity n crispiness as this is a budget phone.. Battery backup is great as expected with a 6000mh battery.

Only flaw I can point out is, the term fast charging associated with this fone Charging time varies between 4=5hrs for a full charge which is not expected
-----
Truly Monstrous performance

Amazing crystal clear display and smooth operation. I am still not happy that the fingerprint sensor doesn't lock the phone, like my moto g. Still, it's quite a package and monster for the price.

Pros -
Screen
Camera
Battery life
RAM
Charger

What could have been better-
Fingerprint Sensor could have locked the phone
Screen isn't really scratch proof, which is understandable considering it's a 3
Plastic body
Processor is not in the league of a Snapdragon but still better than Mediatek

Overall an amazing phone, but please check for a discount. I got 500 rupees off and I'm happy.

Issue in new phone

I faced problems from day one. When I opened the box and was trying to charge the phone adapter was not working. 2nd day I went to service centre and they replaced the adapter. Battery is drying fast while it is 6000 mah. I thought there is some issue with the new phone but due to lockdown I did not went to service centre for battery problem. I am facing issue every time sometime it is restarting suddenly, due to lockdown will Amazon exchange my phone with the new one or Service Centre will replace my phone. I do not want this phone it will create lots of technical problem in future. So please replace the phone.

I am happy and I know it.

Nothing much to say about disliking,
Because I love this phone,
Camera quality is best,
Battery life was my preferred thing to look for and so now I dont have to worry about it after buying this phone.
Finger print reader is working best, as previously I used some other phones whose finger print reader did suck after using for a month, but Samsung so far has done a wonderful quality built.
I am happy and I know it.

Budget Slayer

Way too amazing budget phone Samsung has ever launched.
The premium quality experience you enjoy on display is beyond expectation in this range.
The finger print is also pretty good along with facial recognition feature which will suffice at this price.
Slim design is unbelievable considering the fact that it's packed with 6000mah battery and on that note, one must not forget how efficiently Samsung has managed to balance and maintain its weight.
Gaming experience is really treat to your eyes as well as your soul, not just saying but actually tried playing Call of Duty(mobile), Asphalt 9 Legends and FIFA, once again what graphic quality at this level of price range.
Camera quality is something you cannot avoid talking in Samsung phone, which in this case also, it beats all the budget phones camera in its segment.
I will just speak for myself, I am really happy with the phone introduced by Samsung, rest it might vary from person to personüôÇ

I had recieved ae defective piece...I recieved this phone on March 16th....keypad getting stuck  from the day one...I thought due to software not update yet..bcoz one update  I kept it hold...but after update also same issue...I'm very disappointed

Technician advised to hard reset  phone .
After that also same issue...

About phone:
Initially battery started charging fast...now its very slow...
And people who habituated to redmi honor will get disappointed  with battery charge..

Battery backup not very good. And i am facing frequent issues with network connectivity and also with sound.. I have to restart now and then to get it working again. Slight heating issue is also there. Overall, i am disappointed with the mobile. I dont know if these issues are in my handset only or is a model defect. Camera is just nice only and not great as i expected from a 64 mp camera. Screen display quality is good and touchscreen is very responsive though.

Samsung Galaxy M31: The Good, The Bad, And The X Factor
By Sandeep Sarkar
Updated: Friday, March 20, 2020, 16:56 [IST]

Samsung has added a new handset in the Galaxy M series dubbed Galaxy M31. The company introduced this series last year to compete against its Chinese counterparts like Xiaomi and Realme who own a major chunk of the market with feature-rich smartphones being offered an affordable price tag.

The latest entrant comes as a successor to the Galaxy M30s which has been quite popular in the mid-range segment. Carrying some traits from its predecessor, the Galaxy M31 is packed with a humongous 6,000 mAh battery and an L-shaped quad-camera module.

At a starting price label of Rs. 14,999 for the 6GB RAM+64GB storage and Rs. 15,999 for the 6GB RAM+128GB storage model, it goes up against the likes of the Honor 9X, Redmi Note 8 Pro, and the Realme XT. Let's see what this device brings to the table and how good is it against the Chinese rivals in our initial impressions:

Samsung Galaxy M31: The Good
High-Resolution Super AMOLED Display

The first thing that will grab your attention while buying this handset is its big high-resolution display. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy M31 with a 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display that churns out 1080 x 2340 pixels FHD+ resolution and has a tall 19:5:9 aspect ratio. Samsung has never compromised with the display quality; which seems evident on the Galaxy M31 as well.

The tall display complemented by high-resolution support makes it suitable for 1080p videos. Moreover, the narrow bezels all around the display give you the maximum area to watch content. The U-shaped notch is slightly bigger.

The colors delivered are punchy and vivid, something which you will find on other mid-range Samsung smartphones as well. The viewing angles and sunlight visibility seems good. But, we will be able to give feedback after a thorough usage. It is worth noting that this is the same display that the company had used on its predecessor, i.e, the Galaxy M30s. So, you can expect the same display output.

Amazing phone with #MEGAMONSTER battery
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Theis phone completely suits to all my needs. I have been using realme 3 pro for the last 1 year. The phone was quite good, but the samsung m31 beats it in almost every category. This phone has sAmoled display, quite loud speakers, type c charging port, amazing aesthetic visuals, sturdy outer body and fast charging. They still have provided a heqdphone jqck in this phone. But the main feature of this phone is its 6000mah battery. I work in a 9 to 6 job, and have my mobile internet on the whole time, due to which my previous phone's battery used to drain fast and it did not run for even half a day. I had to carry a power bank or a charger with me everywhere, which was not feasible. But since I bought this phone, I did not have to complain about battery even once, as even after heavy usage all day, my phone still retains 35% battery by the time I connect it to charger at night. Moreover, the phone is still not very heavy even after having such a big battery.

The phone has 4 cameras on back and one on front. The camera provides high quality and very clear photos. The people who love instant shots will love the camera. There are a lot of features provided with the phone such as time lapse, super slow, bokeh and many others.

It has 128gb storage (which is expandable) , which should be enough for most people now a days. The 6gb ram and their highly efficient in-house exynos processor ensures that there is no lag anytime anywhere.

The only main complaint I have with this phone is that samsung one ui doesn't support 3 finger screenshot and instead provides palm swipe screenshot, which is not comfortable at all. Most of the time, it doesn't work. I really hope they provide 3 finger screenshot option in the next update.

In the next iteration of this phone they can provide a faster charging option (more thwn to 15 watt) , a screen with faster refresh rate, more efficient processor and other minor upgrades. But for now I'm 99 percent satisfied with this phone( aside from that palm swipe screenshot). This is a must buy phone.

Samsung M31 after 1 month of usage.
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I have been an Samsung S7 edge user before this and bought Redmi note 8 pro and Mi A3 for my wife and Mom, and used those extensively and this review is based on a comparison of all these phones.
Pros:
Firstly M31 is at its price point of 16k for the 128GB model is amazing with its overall camera performance and Battery life. The camera is definitely better than the note 8 pro. The 32MP selfie camera has the right colors output for Indian faces.
My S7 edge's amoled screen was incomparably with the budget phones till now, but the amoled screen in the M31 didn't disappoint me at all. The 5MP macro lens now makes more sense than the 2MP macro lens of Note 8 pro which I believe is useless. The M31 macro lens gave some really good shots.
Android 10 out of the box and Samsung's UI is definitely much better than Redmi or Stock android of Mi A3. For multimedia, this phone is really good with its screen quality and sound quality with Dolby atmos support.

Cons: Although people say you do not feel that the phone has a 6000 mah battery as it doesn't feel heavy but actually if you use the phone a lot and for longer durations, you will surely feel the weight. Now that is also because I use a back cover with the phone but again practically majority of us will use a back cover.
Secondly the phone is not powerful enough to play games for durations. After playing COD for 1 hour, the phones becomes a little hot and game play shows some lags. So definately not for gamers. The Note 8 pro is the best phone for gamers at a much lesser price.
Fingerprint sensor is fast enough, not the fastest though. The only thing is they should have given in-display sensor on the front as if the phone is on the table I have to pick it up everytime to unlock.

Overall for people like me who like a good lasting battery, a good screen and a good camera, this phone is perfect at this price point. Plus Samsung service which I have used a lot with older phones gives the edge to choose Samsung over others.

Power packed Smartphone in pocket friendly price

Samsung Galaxy M31 is a power packed Complete Smartphone. I did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and I did not find myself waiting for an app to load all over again.

The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. I enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which let you stream full-HD content.

I played PUBG Mobile on the Galaxy M31, and the game defaulted to high settings by default with the graphics set to HD and the frame rate to High. The game was playable at these settings and I did not notice any issues. After playing for 20 minutes noticed a four percent battery drop, and the device did get warm to the touch. The big battery will allow you to play for quite long without needing to plug the smartphone into the charger.

With my usage, the battery lasted us for close to two days without any issues. If battery life is important to you, the Galaxy M31 will not disappoint.

Samsung Galaxy M31 cameras

I found the Galaxy M31 to be quick to detect what it's pointed towards and lock focus in daylight. Photos turned out well and had decent details. Text at a distance was legible on zooming in. The smartphone enables HDR automatically if required. Switching to the wide-angle-camera is easy and you can get a wider field of view. However, while these shots look great as is, zooming in reveals that this sensor misses out on details. Wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges.

The Galaxy M31 is capable of separating subjects and backgrounds when shooting close-ups, giving a natural depth effect. The macro camera takes decent shots.

In low-light the Galaxy M31 takes longer to lock focus, so you will need to be patient while taking shots

Best and Good mobile

Galaxy M31 sports a rectangular camera module at the back in the top left corner. The camera setup comprises three camera sensors and an LED flash. There is a fingerprint scanner in the middle, followed by the Samsung branding at the bottom. Upfront, there is a waterdrop notch at the top and fewer bezels. The chin has a 3.5mm audio jack, USB Type-C port, and speaker grille (from left to right). The head doesn‚Äôt have anything. The left side of the smartphone is home to a SIM slot and the left side houses the volume rocker and the power on/off button. Speaking of the volume button, it is placed quite high and reaching it wasn‚Äôt as easy as it is on any other smartphone.

The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, which is known as the Infinity-U display. The name arises from the presence of a waterdrop notch.

The M31 is Samsung‚Äôs cheapest phone to feature a 64-megapixel rear camera, and using pixel binning, it takes 16-megapixel photos in auto mode. And daytime performance is pretty good. There‚Äôs plenty of detail in the photos and good dynamic range. The same goes for video recording. The M31 is also the cheapest Samsung phone to sport 4K video recording (at 30 fps), and apart from a lack of stabilization, videos captured in daylight look pretty good.

With a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, it‚Äôs no wonder the Galaxy M31 can last a really long time on a single charge. I always got a full day of battery life with heavy usage, and with light to not-too-heavy use, you won‚Äôt have to charge it until late evening the next day, at least if you stick to mostly Wi-Fi. Switching to LTE brings down battery life, naturally, but you can still get a full day out of it with fairly heavy use.

Best mobile phone under 20,000
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
This is the best mobile phone under Rs  20,000. My detailed review after a week of usage.
1. Battery life - This phone has full day battery life. I don't have a television and mobile phone is my only source of entertainment. So you can imagine my usage pattern. I used to charge my old phone two times a day but not this beast. Easily runs through the day with maximum usage including moderate.l GPS navigation and high brightness.

2. Display - Again no other brand can dare to compare. Not even iphone. Best display. Keeping this one short because i am short of words for this display.

3. User Interface - Everything on point. One UI 2.0 is a treat to operate. Using samsung phone after a long time and it feels great to be back home after using MIUI ( xiaomi ) , EMUI ( Huawei ) and one plus. UI has all the important features and perfect placement to make it highly efficient and usefull. Screen transitions are joyful. Smoothness of another level. Feels like butter flowing under my fingers.

4. Camera - I have attatched few sample images where you can really appreciate the amount of detail this beast can capture. 64 MP shots are crystal clear with very level of detail.
Again i am short of words to explain the camera. Simply best camera phone under Rs 20,000. While all other brands keep explaining how you can use pro mode to make it intresting but in this phone you can simply point and shoot and results are always interesting. Also there is pro mode and many other modes if you still need them.
I have become a fan of this phone and a fan of samsung.
No negative points so far , i will keep updating this review in future if i find anthing good or bad.

My friend  grand master galaxy M31

5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Hi,  my name is ranjith,  living in chennai and work as civil engineer,  thanks to make a valuable  chance for give a feedback about the  grand master M31, I didn't expect this much of best futures in grand monster galaxy M31,  bcus the camera quality for both front and back was awesome and unbeatable as compare to other mobiles with in a limit prize.

Battery backup was so good,  i did a charge last 2 days before but still my mobile have 35%.

Video quality for supporting all HD content  videos,  are best to seen with high quality and dolby atmis 360¬∞ surrounding sound.

Highly secured with finger print censore.

Android 10.0 and one UI 2.0  was performed good with out hanging eventhough while use large file autocadd,  primavera,  stadd pro soft wares.

It retains the same super AMOLED display,  exynos 9611 SoC and long - lasting 6000?mAh battery. There's also a small waterdrop notch on the display. However,  when you watch movies or play games on the device,  the Infinity -V display on the device doesn't distract.
Although still great at handling basic of daily use,  and even good at handling multitasking.

The company has  essentially upgraded the cameras to offer a higher resolution  64MP sensor and quad camera setup. Good photo quality in daynight

The sumsung Galaxy  M31 comes with a familiar design.
The galaxy m31 also carries  on the good work with phone's camera  system  which is quite impressive for the price...
The ultra-wide lens on the device  makes the phone more versatile at clicking different tyoes of shots.  5 megapixel macro lens for close up shot we found to be quite good

Great phone in the Budget phone Segment minus the old Processor
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I was looking for a budget phone with a decent battery and camera.

Samsung M31 seemed to fit in that category perfectly.

Pros
1) A gigantic battery of 6000mah with a 15v quick charging option. Gives you so much relaxation when you are using multiple things through the day. Have sailed through a day without battery charging.
2) The Live focus feature on the camera works pretty well for the price it is being offered.
3) Great captures with minute detail capturing under ample light. I am yet to use it under low light.
4) Pretty lightweight for a phone with such huge battery size
5) Two Sim card slots plus a memory card slot over and above the 128 GB storage is a bonus
6) A secretly hid Dolby Atmos feature which adds quite an impact on the sound when on bluetooth or earphone

Cons
1) A very outdated processor which doesn't do justice to the 6GB Ram being offered. The functioning is quite okay
2) Need to really work on the Face Unlock technology. I had to stop using face unlock on the second day because I was tired of so many disapproval from my phone
3) Once you disconnect the call there is a 2 second lag for the call screen to go away which gets pretty annoying.
4) Lot of redundant apps being given with the phone and loads of unwanted samsung apps attached which doesn't add value to your functions.
5) Plastic body with multiple hand prints if being used with a cover.

Overall If you are looking for  a budget phone with amazing camera and battery this is your phone. But if you are too much into gaming configuration it is not going to entice you much.

IT'S WORTH BUYING SMARTPHONE IN MID RANGE
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Samsung is constantly improving its level..on mid range phone..
If i talk about its...looks i think you may have to compromise a bit....but wait a min..there's a lot imp things rather than looks...

1.Camera‚úå üíñ----- Awesome camera quality, some says that there is no zoom feature in 64mp mode..yes it is right...but honestly speaking you dont require one, as the pic is so clear that...it really gives a stunning details.

2. Battery‚úåüíñ--awesome battery power of 6000mh...if you are a heavy user I am dam sure this is gonna be a very plus point...
One imp thing also...when I was buying this phone I got to know that it dosen't come with fast charging...and you have to wait 4 to 5hrs ...I was bit worried about that...but when I first charged my phone I was shocked to know that you can completely charge your phone in 60mins.

3.Fingerprint‚úåüíî---As usual you expect from Samsung it's awesome but...there is no..in display fingerprint sensor.

4.Displayüíñüíñ---Its super awesome as its SuperAmoled

5üòîüòîüòî.The thing  from which I am disappointed is only that it doesn't come with..Samsung Knox.üòî...but I think if you dont use this..then this phone is worth buying...but if you use this feature then shift to A-series...

6..üòâüòâA most imp thing is I am a Samsung user from last 6years I can assure you Samsung gives...more than what is shown in display...as many small features which we use in daily are generally not covered in Advertisements.
-----
Great phone! All the features are advertised by Samsung. #MegaMonster!
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I ordered this set on the first day and the delivery was amazing.

All the features of this phone are as advertised. The outer body is same as that of Galaxy M30s and M30. A little on the thick side due to 6000mAh battery.

Camera and battery life are excellent. The charger that came along with my set was white in colour.

Though, there is a bug in the phone (which is also found in Galaxy S10+) where the in-call speaker becomes your primary speaker. You can google about this bug. Hopefully, samsung will resolve it in the future updates.

Android 10 and one core is great. There are application like Bixby vision, AR emojis which is novel and interesting. Game launcher is also great in managing and organizing games.

Back cover is must as the back panel is shiny and smudges doesn't look great. Overall, the phone is great and price is reasonable.

Life like mobile
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I bought this mobile after using the previous version. i.e. M30. compare to previous phone, this phone has really good improvements. Pros of the phone is given below
1. Good battery life: Once fully charged I am using this phone for two days in normal conditions. Even if extensive gaming, battery longs for a full day
2. Big storage helps you in storing large number of photos and data without thinking
3. Amoled Screen gives you super fine experience while watching movies. I use mobile phone for watching movie even if my laptop has big screen only for its amoled screen expereince.
4. I have been using it for around a month now and it never struck or were never lagging.
5. I have played high graphic games like pubg. It supports well

However there is small con I noticced
1. Camera is good. But if you want low light photography, it is not upto the mark
-----
Value for money | Handy | Great Camera | Lightweight
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Value for money: Truly a value for money phone, as in this range you are getting everything you need.

Handiness: Great confidence on hold, I have always used phones without back covers and tempered glass. When I was buying this phone was thinking how will I manage this big phone but I was surprised as it is not slippery with a glass-like material which keeps your look on.

Camera: Great camera, I am not much mobile camera freak but when I used it I found it extremely great in the range.

Battery: It is fine, stays for 1.5 or 2 days was expecting it will last for more time but it is fine as there are many services which are continuously running so it's fine. And I was thinking that with 6000 mah battery it will be heavy but it's not as compared to other phones.

Sound: Quality of sound is very good whether it is speaker phone or as you can play music aswell and it's enough for a small room.

Screen: It is good, as it's a display and picture quality is great it shows real colours.

Backside: I liked this new material by Samsung which is used in the backside of this phone, as when you hold your phone, you will not feel it slippery and in this range it is great, the only thing I felt is it's backside cover quickly captures the dirt of hand and drops handprints etc.

King samsung M31
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I bought this phone because of the brand name "samsung". The first touch phone which I was used is Samsung(sliding type with touch). When I saw the add of this m31 I fixed this in mind.
  This phone is one of the most fantastic phone which I have ever seen. There is no words to say about The Batery life. It is Amazing. I can watch continuously 6 movies from 100%. Still the charge is 50% only . Even in my nonstop use I am getting 2.5 days battery life.
 Camera quality is also an amazing thing. Video quality  is like a Digital camera video. Photos are getting more and more clear during zooming.  Camera clarity is supeeeeerrr..
Fingerprint reader is excellent . It is too fast in unlocking using finger.
Ram is also fabulous.  No hang or delay. Sound quality is also super.
  From my point of view I have no negatives to say. This is an excellent phone . A huge facility in an affordable budget. I suggested this phone to 2 of my friends and the purchased too... so dear friends  pls choose this phone, u will not get this much features in any other phone. Others may have more features but they have no battery life and maximum 6 hrs back up. They have no brand value also. A small battery with more load can't use for more time. But our samsung is king. Pls try once u loved it u will not change ur mind.
  Still I am fall in love with samsung. Especially the battery life... thank you samsung team for giving this gift to us. ........

Absolute gem from Samsung
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars

Before reviewing my samsung M31, I would like to share what I was actually seeking in a phone.
1. Best available battery life with fast charging
2. Good audio quality in video recording (for uploading acoustic guitar covers on YouTube)
3. A nice camera
4. Good enough processor for multitasking
5. Additional slot for expandable memory

This M31 from Samsung proves great on all fronts as per my requirement.
I am not a pro tech savvy who goes into the minute detail of every feature but would sum up the best I could experience in the last 5 days.

Camera Quality - My wife loved it more than her One plus 6T, pretty unbelievable though. Both front and rear (4 lenses) do their job quite well.
I video recorded a guitar cover and both picture and sound were upto the mark.

Battery life- one full charge lasted around 36 hours on a normal usage. 0-100% charge took around 2.5 hours ~ 150 minutes.

Gaming/Processor - Played Real cricket 20 and Gear club Racing, absolutely smooth.

Feel of the phone - Slightly bulky due to heavy battery but that's okay.

Most features similar to A51 but price almost 8k lower.
For someone like me who doesn't like to spend more than 15k on a phone, this might be the best option for you.

Mega Monster at 15k price range.....
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Pros
1. Excellent sAmoled display with stunning camera stills
2. Superb battery backup with 6000 mah
3. Blue light protector can be enabled to protect our eyes from harmful blue Rays emerge out of phones
4. Average processor but ok
5. Definitely a monster at this price range
Cons
1. Mobile gets heated up bit while using camera and other apps continously. Also, during software update
2. Full Mobile charging 1%-100% takes up to 2.5hrs for full charging as the charger is15w fast charger and not 25w charging like in other phones.

Overall rating 4 and 1 star less for above cons.

However,  an extraordinary mobile at this price range with a great brand SAMSUNG. Blindly,  go for it your budget is less than 15k

Worth for the price

I was previously using moto g5s plus and this was selected after comparing many models in this price range. Using this for the past 4 days. Everything is fine, the clarity, sound, network, net speed, gaming. Heard many negative reviews for the processor used. But comparatively no drawbacks. You can definitely go for this model. And to mention, the SAR value is also very very less in the price range.
Battery life is only one day for full Internet usage and 3 hours of calls.

This is wrost phone of samsung brand. Because once a time samsung gives update a mobile. I am updating according to this after updating mobile screen looks blue and phone doesn't work. Any function of Mobile does not work it look like a dummy phone. I will call on customer service but he doesn't reply. So please customer don't buy this phone. If you're not believe please search on Google and YouTube also about this phone regarding update of this phone.

Awesome All-rounder under 20000 Rupees
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
‚óèIt is an amazing phone which provides all-round performance whether we talk of battery(which is the biggest current battery available the 6000Mah)

‚óèIts camera is also incredible as compared to other smartphones in this range. As well as above mid-range smartphones also doesn't have such camera (64+8+5+5). It also has AR Doodle and AR Emojis.

‚óèNext is its performance which is obviously one very nice. While playing PUBG one can easily enjoy the game on high graphics for long without major overheating issues.

‚óèSamsung is known for its security and it has provided:-
&gt;Inbuilt McAfee antivirus protection,
&gt;Inbuilt VPN
&gt;Inbuilt WiFi protection.

Also the OS and UI are amazing and very handy.

It also has amazing split screen view which can even run in camera. And using pop-up view we can even open 5 APPLICATIONS at a time and even more.

Users may not be able to find all these features in first time but will obviously able to find them by viewing some tutorial video of this beast smartphone.

By using this smartphone one can surely say that this is a #MegaMonster

Samsung Galaxy M31 Review after use of 4 days
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Pros:
Good Battery life. After 100% charging I watched 5 movies (Indian) and used mobile data during my train journey. Battery lasted for 1.5 days.
Width: Width of screen compared to My old Redmi Note 3 is less and hence was easy to hold on.
I brought this phone for Battery and speed and I am totally satisfied.

Cons: In Sunlight brightness is not that g8t. My old Redmi Note phone I was able to watch videos without any issue.
-----
Brilliant Phone

I am rating this phone 5 stars because -1.The camera quality is Brilliant,2.Screen Quality is Fabulous,3.The Processor is Fantastic,4.The Ram and Rom are Mind Blowing,5The Processor is Extraordinary.This Phone is the Definition of a prefect android phone.Well done SAMSUNG and ANDROID.

Best midrange phone with packed features
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Likes : The phone looks stunning and packs great features. The best part 6000 MaH battery which never feels bulky as the weight is balanced so nicely. The phone comes with all positive features in good price point. The UI is easy to use and no useless preinstalled apps like Realme phones. It makes all sense to buy this device with name tag Samsung.

Dislikes: The camera could have been better. The back panel gets scratches easily during daily use and finger prints are easily noticeable. But this might be the case with most of the phones in this price range.

Conclusion : The phone comes with all good configurations in a good price point and there is no need to spend extra for just higher processor speed. Of course the more you spend the more you get but remember all phone get old and new ones replaces them sooner.
-----
A well balanced device to have.

4.0 out of 5 stars

Display : This is an oled panel, the colors are
  absolutely gorgeous. No flaws.

Battery: This is again a plus point in this
  device, I use my mobile phone for 2
  or 3 days once it's fully charged.

Camera : 64MP camera has some dynamic
  range issues but it is good for the
  price segment.

  128 MP camera performs good in
  daylight not in night.

  Macro lens is great.

  I usually take less selfies. But the
  selfie cam is pretty decent.

Charging time for this device is long because of the monster battery.

I do not play games on mobile phones. So can't say much about gaming performance.

I use a lot of applications concurrently and this device hasn't failed me yet.

I am very satisfied with device.

ite ¬∑ Reviewed on samsung.com
Well, the Samsung Galaxy M31 arrived in blue, the first thing I did was put the case that I had already prepared. The battery lasts a whole day if you hit it hard with games. It can be said that I was there all day, from when I woke up to falling asleep playing on my mobile and using it, and it lasted with a 10% battery surplus. The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything. The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaint with anything about this mobile and 64GB of internal storage, I do not even consider using the microSD slot since 64GB for me is enough, combining it with Google Photos is much more than enough for me.

Yes
Wen i purcahsed n ordered it i was very glad but wen i started use it, i had noticed these points:-
1.) Poor camera quality it showed its camera quality is 64 mp but back camera is like 5-8 ,mp n front is like 2 mp thats it...
2.) Bettery backup:- too much dessapointed it takes more than 3 hours to full charge and after 7-8 continue used it again came at 5% from 100%..

3.) Hanging issue:- sun can changes its direction but there is a strong connection i had noticed till now that is sumsung phones and its hanging issue..today after 3 months later i m very much sure nobody cannot improve sumsung's this issue..
4.,) less features in front video:- if u are photography lover then Do not purchase it bcoz it has very low front video quality...

5.) Yes u can use it as a memory card only coz it has good storage capacity, i purchased it6gb RAM and 128gb ROM so i can store so many video n audio in it which were ctreated by other good cameras or phone..
6.) No use of default programme or apps.

I share some Tech Details.

In First Photo, You see Ram in GB.
(5.43 + 2.50)(Ram + Swap Memory)
Swap memory work same as Ram and its good to see in Samsung. In final words Samsung give you 7.93 GB instead of 6GB.(Maybe Swap memory use for Game boost)

In Second Photo, You see the home with 5x6 grid layout.

In third Photo, You see Software Details.

In fourth, You see black and white photo.(idk what you call)

Samsung Camera is good. Samsung also told you which look is good for shot.

Samsung M31 not support Knox Security.

Samsung with 6 with 128GB it's really a #MegaMonster.ü§™üòà

Not that good as the Samsung brand is expected to be

3.0 out of 5 stars

Likes:
1. Battery is good.
2. Camera appears good, though I haven't yet observed/used it keenly.

Dislikes:
1. The width of the handset is less than the optimal, making typing difficult due to the jumbling of alphabet in the portrait mode.
2. System heats up even during the simple applications.
3. It even hangs down while using simpler applications.
4. The overall software is not user friendly, making simpler things complex.
5. Not at par with Redmi phones. My Redmi Note 4 was better than it in many respects.
6. The seller is casual and not competent enough as the packaging was quite imperfect for the phone. The phone box was simply kept in a big cardboard box alongwith some other item, without any cushioning. The seller should be blacklisted by Amazon.
Redmi Note 8 Pro is a better option. I Regret for buying it.
-----
Excellent option at cheapest price in the range!
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars

Though I was apprehensive to buy this phone after using my previous One Plus 5 for the last 3 yrs yet I  must say that this by far the best decision I have made in the month! #M31 is a monster rightly as highlighted in their ads constantly. Few of my friends were chosen to give the first reviews and I am glad I believed them!

The 64 mega pixel camera is fantastic and has a good AI attached to it because it can differ food objects and nature pretty vividly. The finger print sensor at the back is quickest indeed. And the battery life is super amazing too. Though the charging scene is a bit slow but it's okay to give that time off to the phone once in two days.

I chose the 128 Gb option since I have a bundles of data to carry and the phone is clearly standing up to my expectations in the last 10 days.

This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.

I'm very much happy with the quality of phone samsung come up with .
But I m much disappointed with the people's I don't know wheather they are from samsung or any third party agency of samsung  , calling me every day and forcing to write review, in addition of that they are arguing for the same , that's too much pathetic.
What's wrong !!! Hallo !

That's not sales , that's not how it works ,people's are writing their review if they really feels good , you cannot force !!
 If you do so it will always have a bad effect for one's who really developed this nice gadget.
That's  very wrong gesture just to get catch few review to increase sales . But believe me that may have wrong effect too..

Like I rated 2 star for a such nice phone which  deserves at least 4 star ....

Excellent phone which is quite a steal for Rs.16000

Pros:
Currently the best budget phone on market imo

Camera quality is excellent for a phone of this price.

Excellent display

Game performance is good. Had no problems running games like PUBG in high graphics.

Excellent battery life. Currently writing this review I haven't charged the phone for 2 days and still have around 40% charge despite using it frequently.

The music quality while using headphones is amazing, especially due to Dolby Atmos.

Cons:

Sound quality from the phone speaker could be better.

A lot of pre-installed apps was not to my liking, though a few could be uninstalled.

The icons look generic and all the good themes have to be bought through the Samsung store, or you can use other launchers.

Value for money, except for dash charging

I changed to Samsung M31 from One Plus 3, which I was using for 3.5+ years. This phone was a major upgrade for me. Quad- camera, super Amoled screen and humongous battery are the super cons of the phone. Being a non-gamer, I have no issues with the performance. But, overall the phone is absolute value for money. I would like to add a few cons, which I think should be taken into consideration while buying this:
1. No dash charging. Having used One Plus for quite a long, charging the phone becomes a bit painful for me. It takes close to 3 hrs to fully charged from zero. But, having a 6000 mah battery, it takes a lot to time to get drained as well. I was able to use this phone more than 24 hours on a single charge with quite heavy usage and screen time.
2. The speaker could have been a bit louder. It's not bad, but could have been better.
3. The phone is not meant for heavy gamers.
4. Camera UI could be improved a lot and could me made more clean and clutter-free.

Worst Battery Life And Fraud Policies
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Worst battery life, It takes 5 hours to charge 100%, Battery Drains in 12 hours only for normal usage, Decreasing Customer Faith, There is nothing  correct details regarding  battery as it shows in the phones features, Amazon Also Takes Too much  Time For Inpection And Its Technician Are Also Fraud, It is So Hard To Replace might be impossible And there is no return or refund policy, So it's better not to Buy It on Amazon and save your money.

The device is excellent
It gives u a premium feeling
The display is jus awesome
The amoled display is so nice
Very useful for the multimedia consumers
The front camera is not so good
The back camera is excellent
The  battery life is awesome
Not soo good with gaming performance though
Pubg like games will struck
U have to play it in mid to low settings
The charging time is more coz of the 15w charger, it's kinda old model

Conclusion:
If u are a multimedia consumer who watch movies and videos alike, and who are a battery fan, and would love to use the back camera much
Then this is THE BEST MOBILE FOR YOU

If u want more performance oriented phones for gaming purposes, and a selfie addict and don't care abt bat display, then this phone will disappoint you... I would suggest u to go for other phones

But other than that, overall the phone is great...

Great phone at a Great price

The product is handy, the display is very good and so is the battery.
But don't expect too much from the 6000 mAH battery. The features are great and the sensors work good.

Sound:
Sound is loud but clear. You wont be needing to attach it to a speaker when indoors. There is a special Dolby Effect for speakers which you probably should give a try. It is great.

Biometrics:
Phone is supported with Finger print scanner and Face unlock. And these are surprisingly fast as compared to its prior versions.

Apps:
Most apps are supported but some utility app like Samsung Pay etc is not yet supported by the phone. Please work on it.

Gaming:
So far so good. I have tried out pubg and Asphalt. The games work flawless and phone doesn't heat up as expected.

9.5/10 for overall performance
10/10 at this price range

You can definitely go forward and get your hands on it.

Price range is justified by Samsung

4. Feels heavier during holding for a longer time.
5. No earphones with mobile handest.  :(

Samsung M31 latest smartphone you must buy!!
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Samsung recently introduced its latest smartphone in the M-series with the launch of Galaxy M31. The smartphone comes with a host of interesting features and it is priced at Rs 14,999 for 6GB RAM + 64GB storage and Rs 15,999 for 6GB RAM + 128GB storage variant.¬†

¬†

The latest smartphone from Samsung is loaded with a powerful 6,000mAh battery along with improved cameras and sleek design. So, is it enough to compete against the likes of Poco X2 and Realme 6? Let‚Äôs find out.¬†
Let‚Äôs start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.¬†

Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.¬†

¬†
Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review

¬†
The Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.¬†

¬†
That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.

¬†In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.¬†

Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review

¬†
The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.¬†

¬†
Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.¬†

¬†Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review

¬†The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.¬†

¬†
On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company‚Äôs custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.

My Experience with Samsung Galaxy M31
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
At first glance, it is hard to distinguish between the Samsung Galaxy M30s (Review) and the Galaxy M31 from the front. Both smartphones sport big 6.4-inch displays with waterdrop notches, which Samsung calls Infinity U displays, The bezels aren't thin but are acceptable for the price. Just like with other M series smartphones, Samsung has used plastic in the construction of the Galaxy M31. The earpiece is sleek and sits right above the display in the frame of the smartphone.

Pick the Galaxy M31 up and it feels comfortable to hold in the hand. The sides are slightly curved which helps with grip. Samsung has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right of the device. The power button is easy to reach but the volume buttons could have been positioned better. On the left is the SIM tray which did not sit perfectly flush on our review unit. The Galaxy M31 has a 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port, and speaker at the bottom. The top only has the secondary microphone.

When you look at the back of the Galaxy M31, you'll see some changes. The camera module is similar to that of the Galaxy M30s but it now packs a fourth camera. Next to this is the fingerprint scanner which was comfortable for us to reach while holding the smartphone.

The Galaxy M31 packs in a big 6,000mAh battery and weighs 191g makes the device feel a little heavy. Samsung has thankfully bundled a 15W charger in the box which should help keep charging times down. The company offers the Galaxy M31 in two colours, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We had the Space Black variant for review, and it picked up fingerprints and smudges very easily. There is no case in the box, so you may want to buy one.

Samsung Galaxy M31 specifications and features
The spec sheet of the Galaxy M31 looks similar to that of the Galaxy M30s. It sports a 6.4-inch AMOLED display with a full-HD+ resolution. It also has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection which should keep it from picking up scratches too easily. The display has good viewing angles and is legible when outdoors. There are two colour profiles to choose from, and you can also change the white balance.

Samsung has retained the Exynos 9611 SoC from the Galaxy M30s. This is an octa-core processor with four performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.3GHz and four efficiency Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. For graphics, it has the Mali-G72 GPU. You get 6GB of RAM and a choice between a 64GB storage variant and a 128GB storage variant for Rs. 15,999 or Rs. 16,999 respectively. However, Samsung is offering a Rs. 1,000 discount which brings the prices down to Rs. 14,999 and Rs. 15,999 respectively. The duration of this offer has not been specified.

Samsung has bumped up RAM on the Galaxy M31 compared to its predecessor which should give it some leverage while multitasking. We did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps however big apps do take slightly longer. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and we did not find ourselves waiting for an app to load all over again.
The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. We enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which should let you stream full-HD content.

We ran our usual benchmarks on the Galaxy M31. In AnTuTu, it managed to score 191,981 points which are higher than the Galaxy M30s did. The Galaxy M31 also scored 348 and 1,247 respectively in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests. As for graphics benchmarks, the Galaxy M31 managed 41fps in GFXBench T-Rex and 8.9fps in GFXBench Car Chase

I bought this the day it launched. The very moment it was available for sale and got it at an affordable price of ‚Çπ14999, delivered the same day via Amazon Prime. Its been almost 15 days of heavy use now

What i liked:
-Amoled screen is sharp and crisp at displaying. No faulty viewing angles. Drop notch is super stylish and gives a flagship look to the device. Videos can be cropped to fit by the finger pinching out action. i have never seen Adaptive Brightness work so well in any phone.
-Fingerprint sensor is easy to reach at the back below the camera. Quick unlocking and Smart Unlock works well. Face unlock is accurate and works well too.
-Quad Camera setup is one of the sleekest cameras and positioning looks fabulous. The camera is quick to focus, great depth, the 64MP produces sharp images with a focus on the smallest details too. It has features like Pro, Hyperlapse, SlowMo, SuperSlowMo, Panorama, Night mode, Macro (wide), Bixby Vision, AR emoji, Food, 4k video and so much more. The front camera is better than what it looks like. It has perfect positioning, quick to focus and great attention to detail too. Overall, the cameras themselves make this phone worth a buy. Not just better in this range of phones but also than most flagship phones in 40-50k range.
-Android 10 &amp; One UI2.1 are both very clean, precise and extremely easy to use. If you're on any os below 9, this will be a great upgrade.
-The biggest reason i bought this was the 6000mAh monster battery, it is not surprising that they do deliver their promise in this case too. The battery does not exhaust easily. Being a heavy user this battery, after charged fully, lasts around 2.5 days for me. The 15W type C charger that comes in the box takes about an hour to charge it from 0 to 100%.
-There is one external speaker towards the side of the charging port which produces clean and moderately loud sound. Dolby Atmos Sound is also an upgrade if you are looking for a surround sound experience. towards the other side of the charging port, you have a 3.5mm headphone jack.
-The Samsung Exynos 9611 processor lives upto its name. It is faster than i had expected it to be. Also, there are separate slots for memory and 2 sim cards which is a major pro.
-The phone in hand feels very light, despite its huge battery. The Ocean Blue colour looks sophisticated and might give the black variant competition.
-The box has a 15W fast charger with cable, user manuals, ejection pin.

What I didn't like
-It might sound stupid but there is nothing that i did not like about the m31. Maybe they could have provided a headphone in the box but given the features of the phone at such a low price range, that is understandable. Other than that, the phone has delivered to all the claims that it made and I think it is one of the best phones i have owned so far. Great competition in this range. Highly Recommended.

Overall a Fantastic device with brilliant specs, Terrific battery &amp; within this Price Point...!!

Received this from Amazon a week back. Here is review after a week's usage -
1) The build quality of phone certainly ferls premium for this budget.
2) Display is where I believe this device will surely outclass it's rivals. 6.4inch SAMOLED screen with FHD+ resolution looks gorgeous and colours pop out brilliantly. Even in direct sunlight I have no issues in seeing the content.
3) Camera quality is top notch even in low lighting conditions whether it be 64MP Rear cams or 32MP
Front, I infact felt the front camera better than my Galaxy Note 10+ in certain lighting conditions. Plus you get quad camera setup with ultra wide, macro and 4th cam for depth sensing, slow motion, 4k video shoot at 30fps.
4) Battery life is Terrific, 6000MAH lasts easily 2 days on a moderate usage with 4g Calls, WhatsApp,  fee gaming, browsing and youtube content. Icing on the cake is it comes with a 15w fast charger which is superb.
5) Biometrics works just fine wether it's fingerprint or face unlock, accurate and fast.
6) Best part is it comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack which is quite a feature these days. Although Samsung could have provided a headphone with it which I feel is a mandate, but nevertheless the prescene of 3.5mm jack won't feel you sad about it.
7) Internal 6gb of ram and 64gb of storage for base model is quite decent and performance is is quite good. It's fast, there is no lag in any apps. Morever you can expand it via external micosd card upto 1TB.
8) It has an inbuilt FM Radio which was quite surprising feature. There is one bottom firing speaker which ain't stereo but it's quite loud. Can't expect everything at this pricepoint. Moreover you get Dolby Atmos feature as well so mulimedia experience is quite good.
9) It comes with android 10 and Samsung UI 2.0 which I think Samsung has done quite a good job balancing the design, features &amp; usability where I think it's close to being the best software experience on an android. It's easy and clean to use.
10) Overall a well made device with a good usable feature set and good performance, great cameras, terrific battery and software experience. Would highly recommend it as one of the purchasing options while buying a phone in this pice range.

Writing this review after using this phone for more than a month as my primary device.

Not less than a Flagship phone at a very comfortably affordable budget. Slim, light weight and attractive desgine. Premium to hold and use. The screen is amazing and produces amazing colours.
Pros :

1. First of all amazing 64 megapixel camera shoots amazing and highly detailed pictures with amazing colours.. ultra wide angle camera of 8 megapixel is too good for landscape and nature photography.
5 Mp Macro-camera and 5 Mp depth camera adds a special touch to this quad canera device..
Front facing 32 Mp camera captures the true skin colour in almost every situations.
The most amazing feature is its night camera which captures images better or almost equal to some professional cameras.
It also offers 4k video and slo-mo on both i.e. front and rear camera and ultra slo-mo on back camera.

2. 6000 mah battery is more than enough and lasts almost around 26-27 hours approx (am not a gamer or a heavy user but "always on display" is continuously on.)

3. Amazing sound, loud, crisp and clear. Clear voice on calls.

4. No heating problem while on charge or on call or while surfing internet for longer hours.

5. Nice on screen animation and colour reproduction.

Cons :

1. The thing which matters the most is there are not much options in the PRO MODE.
2. The keyboard lags a little bit and takes around 2 minutes to resume back.
3. If you turn on the speakers while on call, you won't be able to hear anything the other person is saying from the other side.
4. When you creat folders on the app screen and add apps on it, the apps would come out every time you restart the phone.
5. There could have been more features in the phone as compared to other brands in this price segment like locks and security, dual apps, IR Blasters etc etc.

Overall am quite satisfied with this smartphone as i wanted a camera centric phone with a large battery and this is absolutely that device.

Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without doubt
best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India seller. I ordered on the first day 5th March 2020 of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Good:

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 50% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!!  Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
- Received two day later  by 6 pm!

Not So Good:

- Not that thin, but ok

- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue

- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.

Feedback

- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.
- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.

Go for it without any doubt.

- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)
- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.

I'll start by saying this is the best Birthday gift I have purchased for myself, also my First Samsung phone.
I will start with the my experience with the phone so far.

Speed:
- Great speed and touch response and Apps opening time is amazing
- Phone boot up is quite fast
- Fingerprint and face ID is very fast compared to In-display fingerprint
- Gaming experience is good too

Camera:
- Attached the shots, see the amazing close up and night mode
- Super amoled display shows the  best possible colors
- Steady camera, till not I haven't got a single blur picture or out of focus, which is amazing
- Image process is impressive, no time delay in capturing and saving the images

Looks:

Trust if if anything matters the most to me is the looks of the phone, this phone looks amazing and quite attractive
One small issue - a bit slippery, but a cover would take care of it. I'm not a cover fan though, I like the phone the way it is.

Features:
Fast Charging
Android 10 One UI2
Memory Card slot
Best - 3.5 mm Audio Jack
Dolby Atmos sound
6000 mAh - more than 48 hours with moderate usage and about day and half with extreme usage
Charting time is about 30-45 minutes
NO ADs - The best part
Sound: Quite loud, over calls as well on speaker side. That's what I love

To be honest, I was so worried about transferring the data from old phone to new one, but found out the Samsung Smart switch app, within minutes every single thing(means everything) from old phone to new got transferred, absolutely had nothing else to do apart from installing the apps.
Assistant is also quite nice.
For me some things were hard to find in the new UI as I was used to other versions, but it has everything that other smartphones are offering and even better than others in the same price segment
Samsung Members is the place I found to be very helpful if anyone has any questions or issues to be discussed about the phone.
The only thing that didnt impress me is the Dialer, its split in 3 parts (Keypad/Recent/Contacts), maybe i'm used to the one page Dialer thats why.
Also the Notification menu, its quite big, I think considering the phone size its designed this way by Samsung.

I'm glad I chose a great birthday gift for myself, I sure am satisfied with the product. Thanks

Budget phone with awesome specs!!!

4.0 out of 5 stars

This phone is overall good for its camera quality, battery backup and its processor. Camera quality is great compared to other phones of this price range. Processor is very fast, as you can open up 4-5 apps in pop up window and the phone dosen't even lag a bit, not to mention gaming- smoothest gameplay you could ever get in this price range.
All that aside the best feature is its battery backup, with a full charge your phone will easily last about 2-3 days over its normal day to day usage.
Fast charging dosen't satisfy much as it takes around 2 hours to charge from 30-100%.
If you're ordering online, make sure to add to cart a tampered glass and back cover along with it, as these are not included in the box, also make sure its of good quality becausethe glass may brake if the phone hits the ground with the corner side.
In short, its an awesome phone and you'll definitely love it...

Best phone for 16k (128gb)
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
The phone is really awesome and worth to spend 16k on. It is very handy, looks nice (back should have been given some gradient design), and very light weight. Operation is very smooth. It is so user friendly that it assists searches, it has settings for almost everything you see on the phone which means you need not compromise with how it asssits you. The best thing I liked is its focus mode which is a must have in any student's phone...also we can create our own mode where we can decide which all applications we must be able to use while having a me time.6 gb + 128 gb is too much to get for 16k from such a reputed brand like samsung. I have been using this phone for past 3 days and it has not made me disappointed. This phone is made for normal users where all your needs are met. Voice quality is good on call, speakers are not so loud,battery backup is awesome with 6000 mah. Options to delete screenshots after sharing was another awesome feature. My gallery used to be flooded with unwanted screenshots and now its solved. Its size is also good. Enough for reading pdfs and watching movies and won't hurt your thumb after long use. I have a suggestion that the pack could have included a back cover also as most of midrange phones comes with backcover with it. Battery takes about 2 and a half hours to get fully charged from nearly 0. Phone comes with android 10. Photos taken are okay. I'm not a photography person. I'm really happy with my choice... Samsung has not disappointed me this time also. I happily suggest Samsung M31 to any normal user.

Overall not bad, but still not upto the mark.
-----
3.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Performance, Display and Battery: Overall speed is good. But touch is not respond properly, like small buttons or moving buttons while playing games. Display resolution is not upto the mark, easily get to know while playing 1080p videos. Battery life is excellent. If you are not play games or paly much videos, would have use 2 days.

Camera: 64MP is for gimmick, that is not up to the mark. Take a picture and zoom it, pictures will be blur. Redmi note 8 48MP far better than this. Day light camera is avg but  low light quality too poor. Macro camera quality is good. Overall camera is can say 2 out of 5 star.

Would have decrease 2k or 1k in a price. But overall not bad.

Go for it..

Newly purchased samsung m31 quite satisfied with the phone. In fact, loving this #Megamonster

Things to know before buying

M31 offers One UI 2.0 (based on Android 10)¬†which is out-of-the-box.
A smooth Android skin, it works well on most Samsung smartphones and has a few nifty features ‚Äì¬†Always-On Display,¬†Ultra Data Saving, and¬†Dual Messenger¬†‚Äì that add to the package.

6.4 full hd Super Amoled display is just Amazing which I couldn't find in other phones in this segment. It gives an enriched experience while watching Netflix or prime. It supports 4K as well.

The colours are vibrant and punchy and the text is sharp and  the sunlight legibility is also quite good.

It has a 6000mah mega monster battery which I love the most. Easily it last for 1.5 or 2 days. And it takes 2.5 hours or less for full charging. Trust me I use my phone for around 12-15 hours a day. With this monstar battery, phone doesn't seem heavyweight. Well done! Samsung

The Samsung Galaxy M31 consists of a¬†64-megapixel primary sensor, an¬†8-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, a¬†5-megapixel macro sensor, and a¬†5-megapixel depth camera, which produce great results in day-time. The images captured by the 64-megapixel sensor have good details and great dynamic range
32 MP selfie camera is amazing.
It supports slow motion, live focus as well
 Overall phone is awesome. If looking for a phone under 15000, I would suggest this is best phone in the market with samsung brand value.
-----
Awesome

The Samsung Galaxy M31 is decently and simply designed when it comes to budget smartphones. There isn‚Äôt too much going on but whatever we have on our plates is still eye-pleasing. When I first held the Galaxy M31, it appeared quite bulky. But as it adjusted to my hands I got to know it was lightweight after all. Made up of polycarbonate, the device comes in two colour options: Ocean Blue and Space Black. I got hold of the black colour and loved the classic black tone of the device, which can never go wrong for a smartphone or anything painted in black. Although the smartphone doesn‚Äôt have a glass back, it doesn‚Äôt come last in the design race and offers us a sleek, not-so-cheap, and sturdy design.
The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, which is known as the Infinity-U display. The name arises from the presence of a waterdrop notch. It is protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is slightly disappointing. The smartphone has a number of display features, which are mostly in the case of every Samsung smartphone. There is Adaptive Brightness, Blue light filter, Dark mode, a choice between Vivid and Natural display colours, Always On Display, Accidental touch protection, Touch Sensitivity and more. While all the display features prove to be helpful, the accidental touch protection doesn‚Äôt really provide any protection as the device could easily be accessed accidentally.
Finally I will suggest others to buy this mobile because of the excellent functionality and features

Great phone by Samsung..
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
After 5 days of use
Pros
1) prompt finger print and face authentication. Face recognition is too fast.
2)Camera quality natural. Quard camera +64 Mega pixel is the best.
3) Gigantic battery life. With all day use of netflix and toutube video, tuning songs , games..
4)it has real HD quality display , suitable for streaming netflix and youtube videos.
5) i feel it has light body due to fibre back cover.
6)Above all has the brand logo of samsung..

Cons
1)I thought that there was disturbance and noise while phone call.. and i was annoyyed but figured out that it was the network problem of sim operator..
So the conclusion is no cons yet

Previously i have used Samsung M30S which i lost just before lockdown and unable to order new phone for next almost 50 days. The day government allowed order for phone i ordered this phone because I have already used M30s i have observed how that performed in term of battery (1.5 -2 days), camera, display etc.
Now M31 is latest version in the sequence  of m30s with better camera quality and display.
I am very happy to get phone in this range from brand like Samsung.

Best mobile ever used by me. Main difference is the display that is just outstanding. Samoled display feels like butter nan, full makhan may be due to samoled and gorilla glass. Love you Samsung. My favourite brand. Battery is good as expected. Overall a masterpiece from Samsung. Goodbye.

The best mid-ranger smartphone till now(Under 15k)

5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I'm reviewing this product after using for a week..It is absolutely an beast in this price segment..One thing about Samsung is that..Its super amoled display,security and build  ...

-SOFTWARE:8.5/10
The new OneUI 2.0 built on Android 10 is superb and user friendly..Also it has some good features

-DISPLAY:9/10
The 6.4inch amoled display  with full-HD+ is good...It supports Widevine L1 to which is awesome..The details were richer compared to other mobiles in this price segment

-BATTERY:10/10
The massive 6000mah is pretty good and it lasts upto 1.5 days for a normal user .Charging from 0-75% is good with 15W charger but after it takes a long time to reach 100% ..
Total time taken (0-100%) is 2.5 hrs..

-SOUND:9/10
The sound is decent..it has richer tone and no distortion at high volumes...The Dolby Atmos supports only with Earphones  but it was excellent. Call quality was good..

-CAMERA:7.5/10
As this model is just an upgraded version of m30s,it is just have been improved...The pics came out well in daylight..dynamic range was pretty decent....But video stabilization and photos at low light was not upto the mark..Macro was okayish...The front camera was okay ..But overall good..

-It is not suitable  for high graphics  gaming...
Overheating is not there...I suggest Samsung  to upgrade  the chipset in the future
-Fingerprint reader is very fast
-Phone is slippery..I suggest you to buy a good case for it.
-----
Best in this price segment

5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I am writing this review after 10 days.
1.CAMERA
I found the rare camera excellent. The photos speak for there selves but focus is not available in macro mode you have to make exact distance about 3cms to clearly have a nice shot, the night mode is very good. When you open Slow motion videos, you fell lag on the videos. I think it is a software problem because i have seen m30s capturing good slow motion videos by having exactly the same proccer, I hope samsung will solve this problem in future updates.
when we came to the front camera, i think samsung tried to improve the front camera from m30s. It is very great but suffers a little at night time.
2.BATTERY
The 6000mah battery on this device is excellent, it last easly 2 days with moderete users. And can last a full day with heavy users so no need to worry about the battery.
3.DISPLAY
Perfect, no problem with that.
4.VALUE FOR MONEY
the best from devices in this price segment.
5.FINGER PRINT AND FACE UNLOCK
finger print is fast and secure, i have no problem with that. Face unlock is very fast during a day. But doesn't work sometimes at night and artificial light sources.

PROS
1.BIG BATTERY
2.AWESOME DISPLAY
3.GREAT CAMERA
4.FAST FINGER PRINT SCANNER

CONS
1.LACKS FOCUS ON THE MACRO MODE CAMERA
2.THE PHONE HEATS SOMETIMES BUT MANAGABLE.
3.FRONT CAMERA IS NOT SOO GOOD AT NIGHT TIME.
3.FELLS A LAG ON SLOWMOTION VIDEOS

Awesome phone.

I I was concerned about purchasing Samsung products as I used to compare Samsung old phones ans Redmi products earlier.

After reading lots of reviews like this, I purchased this and I'm really satisfied.  I'm sharing a few pros ans cons after using it for 3 days.

Pros-

- Superb battery life
- Amazing Screen- Super AMOLED display is unbeatable
- Managed battery weight cleverly - not at all bulky
- Smooth and fast comparing to Redmi
- Handy
- 64 MP is clearly wortg every penny
- Provides Night view camera, Hyperlapse, Slow mo, Super Slow Mo, panaroma, Macro, wide angle and many more options..

I have attached some pictures for your reference.

Cons-

- Haven't provided wity ultra fast charging - it takes 3-4 hours to full charge
- should provide back cover

Good phone in this budget and better than mi redminote 8 pro.

Good phone in this budget and better than mi redminote 8 pro.
First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Good:

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
-----
Monstrous phone indeed!!!

5.0 out of 5 stars

There are multiple reasons to buy this product-
1. The best specs at this price range.
2. Samsung customer service and support is very good.since they have enormous number of service centres.
3. The phone is very impressive in terms of looks.
4. The battery is 6000mah which means you can stop worrying about the battery to drain fast.

I bought this phone on the launch date 5 march and amazon delivered it within 24 hours.The 64MP camera works really good even in low light,This phone also boasts a 32 MP front camera making video calls super clear.Dolby atoms makes listening to songs and music very good experience.
As far as screen is concerned super Amoled display with pixel density of 443 is best in class.I've been using the phone for about 4 days now and the phone works smoothly.The fingerprint sensor is fast.No heating problems detected so far PUBG works seamlessly in the ultra HD mode.I charged the phone to a 100% and then used the phone for about 45 min,to my surprise the battery was drained just to 1%.
So my verdict on the phone-
Battery life-10/10
Camera-8/10
Display-9/10
Software-9/10
Design-8/10
Performance-8/10
Value for money-10/10

Fake Samsung Phone Delivered
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Hi,
I would like to bring this to your notice that I had Purchased Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) Sm-M315FZKGINS worth  Rs.15,999.00 on 5th of March 2020 from Amazon Prime Account which was Sold by STPL Exclusive Online and got was delivered on 7th March 2020.
The Samsung M31 seems to be fake product, its not even a month the phone has stopped working completely. It keeps hanging frequently. While operating any application on phone, it stops responding along with this is issue the speaker quality has become very low (basically it does not functions) No Sound at all. Even while playing random videos on YouTube application as well in the phone's gallery it automatically gets fast forwarded without giving any command.
Its altogether a very disappointing experience not only with the Samsung Phone Brand but also with Amazon Prime Membership Account and the online Retailer (STPL Exclusive Online) listed on Amazon.
I would request to please get the Product replaced Asap, as Due to lock-down I am unable to even take it to Samsung Service Center or to any Mobile Repairing Shop.
Note: Kindly Respond to the above complaint, or legal action will be taken further at your Cost.
-----
Best phone to buy if you are looking for daily usage purposes like movies and awesome camera setup.
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars

M31 is for those who just want a phone which would click decent pictures, have a good battery life, and are not planning for heavy gaming.
Coming to the camera quality, 64 MP camera, it clicks pictures beyond your expectation. The colours seem natural and when you zoom into the pictures you can feel 64 MP.
The only disappointing thing about camera is that Night modes get distorted a lot of times. And even the macro camera didn't perform that good.
Fingerprint sensor is fast but I have faced few issues where it would not respond unless I awake the screen by clicking power button.
Battery life is which stands out in features as it says 6000 mAH. But I am very disappointed about it as after using for almost a week. Even though 6000 mAH, it just feels like I am using a 3500 mAH battery phone. I feel it is the problem with Exynos 9611 processor as it is not optimized. But still you can use the phone for one whole day with playing few games and movies. But with normal usage you can go up to 1 and half day.

But the best feature is that you get sAMOLED display for this price. The colours are awesome. And with widevine L1 certificate you can stream FHD on Netflix and Amazon Prime.

Samsung M31 upset
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Hello peoples, I have purchased this M31 Last month 18 March, am totally upset due to Samsung M31 because of more gaps in this M31.
 I will tell problem -&gt; 1. Macro camera ( in ad they show small boat photo ve≈ïy clearly from a distance but actually it not like that.
2. Only they additional  camera and increase the mega pixel.Additional macro camera totally waste.
3. Battery - 6000MA ok , when I put charge it take 4 to 5 hrs for full charge.
When i compare to my moto g3 it take 2hrs only for full charge in normal charge.
 Charging time  it take too much of time , it waste.
4. Mobile security, actually I interest in A50S for two main reason one for NFC and other one KNOX Security.
in M30 I don't know actually condition.
But I had review Spec of M31 in GSMARENA ,
NFC is available depend on market,
I saw many review none one not say about NFC they not no about that.

Due to KNOX Security, NFC, Battery charging time, Macro camera it totally  upset my mind on the first day of my purchase it self.

If any development in exist mobile model kindly do some improvement.

Positive point , 6GB ram It working well.
-----
battery sucks...takes 8-9 hours to full charge

Writing review after using 2 months.

Amoled display is good.
Camera is hyped. Not that great.
Lacking to perform daily regular task.
Hangs a lot. Need to restart each time.
Initially 1 month full battery charge was taking around 2.5 hours . Now it's taking 8-9 hours.
-----
Decent phone for the price. Could have been better
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Even though on the bulkier side compared to A and S series, M31 is a great phone given the 6000mah battery. This lasts me the whole day on a single charge.

The charger could have been 18+watts and the cable length is pathetic. Not even 0.8 M. Disappointed in the cable.

Decent camera, easy set up using smart switch.
Also brought a Redmi 8A dual and this phone is only slightly better
-----
More than worth it
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Finger print reader lags a bit and is not as fast as the phones other competitors whereas the camera is definitely worth the price (In fact more than value for money). I have compared M31's camera with other brands such as OnePlus and it gives them a competition (But obviously not overpowering them). Bettery life is something that I shouldn't even speak about, the phone lasts for more than 1.5 days for me and when full charged .... üòÇ 6000mah is all I need to say. This pgone overall is totally worth it, no lags as such. Samsung phones generally have poor GPS but there's no such problem with this phone. If you are looking for a phone under 15K then this should be your buy.
-----
A very good phone with great features and best pricing
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Samsung M31 is a very good phone to buy with highest configuration assembled that we can get at this price.
It gives a great feel when using it, with super AMOLED display with 6 GB RAM , ample storage, 64MP Camera and long battery life,it gives you maximum than a other budget phones.

Pros:
1. Long battery life
2. Great Camera (Front and Back) also has wide angle lenses for both front and rear cameras.
3. Smooth Touch Screen Display
4. Perfect Fit in Hand
5. Fingerprint sensor works good
6. OS works really smooth
7. UI is great

Cons:
1. The fast charger provided is only a 2A charger which is less against the battery size, should be on the higher side, takes 2 to 3 hours to get fully charged.
2.  The placement of the fingerprint sensor should have been a bit lower than it is currently placed. Finger reach is difficult.
3. Certain inbuilt apps gets hanged and crashed if they are not updated timely. Also, their update can only happen through galaxy store app. Google Play Store does not respond sometimes.
4. Gets heated up while charging and also when used for a long duration.

Read 100% genuine review for m31

4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I am old user of samsung mobile and i am big fan of samsung display...so for display 5 out of 5 stars...
For camara : i can give 4.5 out of 5 stars...-0.5 because of Samsung captures some high saturated picture.so same for m31 also.
For battery life : 5 out of 5 stars...coz you can go for 1 full day with 6000 mah battery..
For charger : it takes 2 to 2.5 h to get full charge so charger is fast but not so fast.
For performance: 4.5 out of 5 stars as per performance...i am using m31 from last aprox 20 days...i didnt notice any single lag in this phone...-0.5 coz of gaming performance...m31 is good but not that much...

But overall you can surely go for it...this is my genuine opinion on m31...

Budget phone with extra budget facilities...i m satisfied with my purchase...

Thank you
Good product with good price

Amazing Camera and Battery Life.

4.0 out of 5 stars

Hi Guys, Writing Review after using the device for almost 2 weeks. TBH, I was about to buy Redmi Note 8 pro which is in same price range as this one but after thorough comparison i bought Samsung M31.
Pros :
1. Amazing camera. Samsung's M31's photos are more lively and provide you natural element of the clicking environment.
2. Battery Life. It takes upto 2-2.5 Hrs to fully charge the phone and you can use the phone for almost whole day. whole day because at the time of writing this review Lockdown is going on India due to Corornavirus, so i am  always watching Videos and surfing Instagram and Facebook in it.
3. Amoled screen - gives you amazing experience with Videos and movies.

Cons:
1. Not for Gaming - Since i am not gamer, this device perfectly suits my needs. But If you are interested in playing games i would suggest to go with other devices.
2. Charger - Should have given more powerful charger since 6000mah takes alot of time to charge the device with the provided charger.
3. Back of the phone does not feel premium. Feels like a plastic coverup.

I got M31 on 6th March and with  in a month time there was a software update on April 10th. I accepted the software too  my goodness the mobile got hanged and its in downloading status from morning 11 am on wards........... Its like dum next to me .
Reason is there is a software issues in the mobile and also the mobile is getting hanged often.
Its not worth to buy in Samsung  no value for money and it a stress for us.

Cons:
Blur night mode camera

This is one of the best mobiles which you can get at under 20k from Samsung. I'm writing after four days of usage.

Pros:
‚Ä¢ Crisp AMOLED display- Dark mode feature is excellent
‚Ä¢ Excellent battery life
‚Ä¢ Decent performance- No heating or lagging and dedicated sim slots supporting  LTE
‚Ä¢ Good photo quality in daylight- Macro performance is very good

Cons:
‚Ä¢ More notifications related to Samsung
‚Ä¢ Poor video stabilisation
‚Ä¢ Samsung is not giving any back cover with it.While mobiles like Redmi Note 8 and many others at same price are giving back covers.

Overall, it is a good deal to buy this phone.
-----
M31 is overall very Good Phone from Samsung to beat other companies in current market

At this price,very good product from Samsung...
-----
First of all I will tell you about this product after using 1 week...
1. Coming to the bettery part.. this product has very good battery performance.. battery capacity is 6000mah..

2. I loved display of this product.. display is very very good... see the picture of that display.. i loved it.. this display is sAmoled.. for this price.. this is good.

3. Comming to the Samsung UI.. SAMSUNG has very good UI compared to other brand...it just feel smooth perfomance...

4. There are 64mp main camera.. and 8mp ultrawide camera.. and 5mp macro camera and 5mp depth camera... obviously 64mp provide very sharp images.. but while using this lens.. we can't zoom in... ultra wide camera is good... macro camera also good..

5. As we know Samsung has its own processor Exynos... this exynos processor has little power consuming processor as compared to snapdragon... but this exynos has very good AI about camera...

I couldn't find any drawback of this product at this level.. after using 1 month. i will update my review.. thank you

Best high end device within budget in market. This time Samsung team have outdone themselves. Samsung m31 beats 24000 rs smartphones available in market
Amazing display quality
Awesome pixel density 411 ppi
Smooth performance
Superb look
Battery size is monstrous 6000mah biggest in normal smartphone market. First time i feel like i don't have to charge my smartphone all the time.
Camera quality is also also awesome
I was amazed when i saw this phone and purchased it on the day it launched.
Yes it take little longer to charge it but its obvious because of its battery size.
If you want best smartphone under 25k go for it.
Thank you Samsung for making such a device possible :)

Awesome with happiness!!

Samsunga galaxy m31 is a decent buy in this category, this phone is suitable for thoose persons which are not too much into gaming altough games work as charm in this one still not recommended fir intense gaming.
Pros
¬∞Awesome battery life, it is what it is claimed Monster.
¬∞Camera quality is decent
¬∞ display is awesome
¬∞ very light weight considering a 6000 mah battery
¬∞android 10 and one ui 2.0 works like charm
Cons
¬∞Cheap plastic made although it will affect you still glass would have been preferred
¬∞ when you second zoom in pics even in daylight the quality is bad
¬∞ slutters in intense games
¬∞fingerprint sensor is small for big fingers although this is the same fingerprint sensor used on all samsung phones in this category still samsung needs to change the diameter of the sensor, response is quick though
CONCLUSION: if you are really tech savvy, gaming type of person then this is not the right phone for you but if you need some brand value and a decent phone which can handle day to day tasks with ease then go for it.

Only buy if you're an average user and your priority is battery life.

3.0 out of 5 stars

Should be fine for an average user. I dont think this phone can handle heavy gaming. The only game I play on this phone is coin master and I've seen that game not load or just close on its own like 5 times in the 2 weeks I've owned this phone. Camera isn't that good. Display is ok. But its the large battery that is the only reason I bought the phone, and it does last long. Light gaming, YouTube, instagram, twitter, and other daily tasks is no problem for battery life. You can easily see 9+ hours of screen on time, I've seen as high as 11+. I was glad to see there is no idle battery drain. I go to sleep with the battery at 90% and when I wake up in the morning the battery is still at 90% or sometimes 89%. Which is great.
-----
Best to buy for normal use not for heavy use like gaming.

After using this mobile for two days now im comfortable to write the review.
Pros
1.Strong battery back up(i got 16 hours backup without playing games but i was continuously using internet)
2.camera is way better
3.Screen experience is too good.
4.UI
5.No heating effect while charging the phone
6. Dual 4g
7.No lagging in apps as they have provided  6gb RAM
8.128 GB ROM which is enough
9. Big battery

CONS
Biggest issue is about network.Netowrk is not consistent through out so be aware of this.
1.Fingerprint sensor on back side.It should be on screen or it should be imposed on lock key
2.Material finishing looks cheaper they have used plastic as compared with other brands.
3.Charger should be 30W but m31 is with 15w charger as it takes time to charge
4.In the same price range other brands are giving fastest cpu where as samsung is giving middle class processor to samsung is giving its processor
5.As it is 10nm technology  it reduces battery stand by time while other brands uses 8nm which saves the battery.
6.Charger and mobile design need to be changed.

Well,I had a doubt if i could purchase this phone or not!moreover I was between the devil and the deep sea!I wanted to gift this for my dad for his 50th birthday being a teen habit I saved as much I could and thought of spending my money to get my dad this soon the phone arrived and I had an etching desire to open this and somehow gave this as a present to dadü•∞he was word stuck and all wondered if that was brought from my own savings I was still 17 and none could believe I take this special section to thank the #MEGAMONSTER team for making my dad's birthday a remarkable one thanks again!! About the phone it was worth the money and was radiation radiationless reg. The camera it is wow very peculiar and more significant for capture.... on a overall the team had put a tireless effort in making this phone a great success.. cudos to the team.. and wish n hope that God should bless you people with all the good health, success and abundance of happiness in making this model

Best Buy. Value for money.üëçüëç

4.0 out of 5 stars

I have been using this phone for the last 2 months and I am very satisfied with the performance till now.
Pros
1) Good Camera. Crisp picture quality. Wide angle facility with background  blurring facility.
2) Enormous Battery backup. It lasts me 2-3 days.
3) Quite a good amount of memory (128k). Those who do not load huge games, this memory is huge.
4) Quite a big screen. Aspect ratio is such that it is comfortable to hold.
5) Super Amoled display given crisp picture on the screen.
6) Though it has a 6000 mAh battery, the phone is not very heavy.

Cons
1) Though the fingerprint reader is far better than than earlier Samsung phones, it still needs to improve. The location of the fingerprint reader at the back of the phone is a little cumbersome to operate. On-screen fingerprint reader would have been preferred.

If you are looking for a decent good phone within this budget, go ahead and buy it. It is absolutely the best buy at this price.

Does not live up to its hype..however  a decent buy
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Things that this phone does not live up to its promise:
1. Front camera quality is not good. Dosent feel like a 32 MP definitely. Don't forget to  turn off the beauty mode.
2. The night mode amplifies  up things artificially
3. The main camera does not live upto the 64 mp hype- 48 MP cameras of other phones may be better. However for the price the macro, background blur effect and daylight photos are good.

The operating system with the android  10 is good, screen quality is super, built is nice, fingerprint  sensor  very responsive,  no lags, decent sound quality, super battery.
-----
Good in battery and poor in camera
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars

Product is ok...

Positive:-
1)Charge is drained 100% to 70% from 7 am to 4 pm (including data and phone calls) ...

2) Call audible quality is good...

3) Device Weight is low when compared to Realme

4)Display quality is good...

5) speaker sound is good..

6) Selfies is good in low light areas....

7) Auto call record is available

Negative:-

1) Rear Camera quality is not much high... It's an average quality... photo pixels are broken

2) Heat of the device is little bit high when data is on

3) There is no more accessories except Charger adapter and charger cable

4) Noice cancellation is an average... Surrounding noise is heared to opposition

5) Charging the device from 0% to 100% is 2:45 mints because of 15W charger

6) Face unlock not working in low light areas

Overall Product is good for battery backup users
And not well in Camera users

Awesome phone for this price

For office goers , home makers, I would say this is the best phone with best specification from a well known brand. I am writing this review after 5 days of decent use. Battery can survive for 2 days easily even with decent data usage. No heating issue. 64 MP Camera and video quality is so good like a flagship phone. Without a cover, the phone is too slippery to handle. Wide angle camera quality is okay but I don't use it frequently so it is not a big compromise. Selfie camera with 32 MP is a good trade off. No lag or delay in graphics, the transition is too smooth. Gorilla glass 3.0 is very helpful. Speaker sound and quality is very decent enough. Great Audio quality while using this M31 with bluetooth headset especially with "Dolby Atmos" effect on, which I didn't expect. I was planning to buy M30S, but after knowing the launch of M31, I was waiting for 15 days to book this one. Having a 64 MP camera phone would definitely need a 128 GB storage to store your beautiful memories. Worth buying, go for it.
-----
Best one at the Affordable price
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
- 128 GB storage is pretty good.
- supports 512 GB memory card with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone.
- Rear Camera is really good.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good.
Overall I can say is best one at this price.
As of now no negative side / disadvantages.
Will update again I find any.

Best option in low budget.

Overall phone experience is awesome.
1. Screen- Amoled screen in very good and smooth, colours are very good.
2. Body- Phone body is very good and slim.
3. Camera- 64mp camera is provide in this phone but reality is different its looks like 32 mp camera and front camera is 32mp but reality looks like 16mp. Overall performance of camera is good not excellent.
4. Battery- It has 6000 mah battery. Battery performance is very good but feature of fast charging is a joke. Battery takes 3 to 4 hours fully charged.
5. Fingerprint reader is awsome.

This is a monster mobile. Monster in good sense. Very good battery life well full battery charge take some time well its obvious its 6000 mah battery. Camera quality is best. Not tested 64 mp till now coz its 3 days review, front camera is really awesome. Single speakers and its loud enough. Did not received  earphones in the box, apart from that its the best mobile under this budget. 4.5 star go for it. More over It's Samsung.

Amazing phone with very cool features..Dual volte enables both sim and data connectivity while talking on another number..
Fingerprint is very fast and very accurate
Battery life is "die hard" fan...6000 mAh doesn't drain for two days with continuous usage...
64 mp back cam is superb..Macro feature is very cool... Overall very good buy...Must buy over other chinese brand ..Better features than Most chinese brand.

Not happy as M31 is very low quality
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Not happy with camara back and Front, even front camera is perform like VGA camera.

Also full plastic body seems Samsung made this PRODUCT by mistake and we buy to consider Samsung brand !

Compare to this other all phone are best in quality and money saver too with aluminum body!

Feeling like we fool that use this phone and can't return coz loackdown immediately after buy "covid 19"

This phone is a big black spot on Samsung brand image, I strongly recommend not to buy this.

Night mode also not working face unlock is also frustrating and not working most of time.

1-The Galaxy M family has now transformed into a much bigger lineup and garnered a lot of attention,

2-It offers very good battery life dats long for a 2 &amp; half day backup..

3-Scrolling through One UI 2.0 was smooth and apps were quick to open as well. Throughout our week-long usage, we did not encounter any slowdown or lags while using different day-to-day apps for messaging, social media browsing and so on.¬†

4-it does manage to click shots that are generally pleasing to the eye and come out with rich colour and enough detail, its just possible because of wide angle and monster 64 cam..

5-In the real world, this ultra-wide lens adds an all-new way to look at frames and click pictures fitting in more space than you would be able to use a standard smartphone camera.
6- fingerprint sensor captures impulse on d go ..
 Backcover is very shiny carbonate piece making it light weight .....
Excellent monster features on d goooo!!!!!

A must take it and one of the bestest smartphone on its price cap

Before m31 I have m30s  which is one of the best smartphone coming up at that range. Now as the upgradation move on m31. The camera quality with quad 64 MP rear camera comes with different modes is amazing and spiced up with Bixby vision you can click pictures that hard to differentiate from HD wallpapers. With the 6000 mAh battery can endures your smartphone processes for as long as 1 day of continuous activity (non gaming) Fingerprint is perfectly sensitive and better than compare to m30s. 6 GB RAM can provide perfect speed throughout the running apps. Best part about it sAmoled screen is one of the best features that make it different from other phones the colour quality because of that is completely amazing and on top of that while comparing it to iPhone 8 screen for sure samsung going to win over.

Best Phone in Range of 15k -25k Complete Package
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
One of the best phone to buy in a range of 15k -25k.
I am feeling so happy while using it.
Pros:- 1 - The processsor is super fast and we can easily multitask without any lag.

2- The reason why i choose this phone over Redmi was the AMOLED display offered by samsung which is awesome. Now i can watch movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime with better picture Quality as it feels like i am watching in a theatre.

3- Sound Quality is super as it provides with DOLBY ATMOS in this range .

4- The amazing part is that it has a battery of 6000mah which is impossible to get from any great brand like Samsung. I charge it after 3 days if using on a normal basis.

5- The camera of this phone makes your picture is being clicked by a DSLR. I have now started using this for clicking my pictures and stopped using my DSLR

This phone is a go ahead and experience the great features with it.
I strongly recommend to go for Samsung M31

Honest m31 user suggestion
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Mobile features justifies with its name that is mega monster.
Pros.
1. Battery life- as I'm using mobile from last 7 days it's battery life is beyond my expectations. I'm heavy user and battery running life is arround 48 hours.
2. Camera- four different cameras works in very good manner. Picture quality is excellent. When i zoom the picture it don't make blurred pixels.
Front camera is also doing it's duty strongly.
Mobile with latest features are excellent
Few of them are pop up screen, side button uses, good adoption of fingerprint sensor.
And the best thing is its super amoled display makes this mobile very attractive.
Cons.
If i talk about mobile cons there is only one what i get is- facelock feature is not working as good as i expected.
Rest choice is yours, but after using this mobile i have recommended my friends to buy this mobile, and give you suggestion the same.
In it's price segment it's really mega monster.

Ghost touch problem after a day of use
-----
2.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Bad experience of a Samsung product even after years...
Hate the processor (Exynos 9611) as it doesn‚Äôt support quick performance or fast charging.

Just after a day of use got ghost screen touches problem and was hard to force restart...got solved automatically but lost my confidence.

Better processor, fast charging, glass build quality would have been better for the price.
-----
No Privacy and Security.
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
This is not for professional users. This does not have any security feature. You cannot lock any app and it does not have any secured folder. It's required to store any password or important data. Some times our mobile will be used by friends or kids, during that time this phone is not useful ,No privacy or security. Installing third party apps for this purpose may be risky.

I used J7 series earlier, in that feature was there whereas in m31 it's not there. I have seen many reviews and no one mentioned about this.

Finger print reader you have search. Back cover and sensor almost  same texture.

Charging is normal only not fast. Audio output in below speaker is not enough.

When flash is used video is coming black  in slow motion camera.

It's easily getting heated up. After video recording u cannot make call comfortably. Near ear piece it's hot.

Overall I feel disappointed with the security feature.

Big battery, Exceptional Cameras and Superb Display
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
The phone is absolutely amazing!!! I have bought it myself on the very first day of the sale, and by my usage of about 9 to 10 days, the phone is absolutely killer. Although it's not aimed for gamers in mind, the m31 still pulls off games with great ease and no lag. Moreover, the phone feels lightweight as a feather despite packing in a 6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging, which charges this battery in about 2 hours. The display is the best part of the phone. Extremely gorgeous display with a small notch. Moreover, the quad camera array at the back houses an 64 MP camera, which gives extremely detailed photos. The 8MP ultrawide and the Macro camera also are the best in this price bracket. I am exceptionally happy to upgrade from my old phone to this one, and I would recommend it to someone who is a causal gamer and wants a phone with a big battery, great display and awesome cameras. The hashtag used by Samsung #MegaMonster is truly apt for this phone.

Amazing phone, smooth, feels more like i phone 11. Its battery takes a lot of tike to charge...but once charged alcan be used forever
Okay so, the phone is better than any other phone launched recently
I guess its been some weeks since i have been using this but this monster feels just like  a brand new one.
My suggestion is never put a screen guard or a tempered glass on the phone coz it lags the phone and touch response becomes really bad BUT..there s a setting for the screen guard users to increase sensitivity and it goes smooth again
The phone s brilliant and i love the performance and its very light in weight. The battery backup is cool and long lasting.
I literally watched a 3 hour movie with just 16percent charge in phone..
I suggest all the customers to buy a m31

I am reviewing this after 1 week use of Samsung Galaxy M31.
Design : Premium look and feel.
Camera : M31 has best camera in its segment. Picture clicked on it has very minute details even if you click the image very closely. I have taken the few and you can check. I'll rate 5/5.
Battery : Battery is also exceptionally well that lasts upto 2 days with moderate usage. 5/5
Processor : Till now it is running very smooth. seeing no lag so again will give 5/5.
UI: Samsung provides customer friendly User Interface. Face unlock works little bit slow but fingerprint sensor is very fast. 4.5/5

Earlier I was using redmi note 6 pro but I found so many issues specially GUI and device hang, I decided to switch to samsung and till now I am pretty much satisfied with it.

Yesterday I got stucked when I was using keyboard..I have to restart the mobile...anyhow after this I didn't get any problem.

Front camera is not much butter as compare to other mobile 32 mega pixel comera.
The image getting blured when zooming  the image.

Rear camera is good.
All sensors are working as expected.

Some features must be implement which I didn't find in this mobile like -

1. Internet speed status bar on the top of the screen.

2. Daily data usage should be visible inside the top scroll bar It will help the user to limit the daily data use otherwise he went to know only when he spend 50% or 90% through sim card notification.

Battery life is good and we are able user it more longer time as compare to other mobiles.

I love the screen quality of this mobile.
I got some new features in this mobile which are really  very helpful. Thanks Samsung!!!!!!

M31 in a review
-----
I did a lot of research before i bought this phone. 1.First of all, the battery life is absolutely amazing, a heavy user like me is not able to kill battery in a day.
2. The camera quality is quite decent. Although expected more , but for this price range it is pretty gud.
3.The display is top notch , its quite gud and colorful.
4. The fingerprint scanner has absolutely no time lag. It is very well made.
5. The performance is quite gud. Although, samsung Exynos was used. There was many critics who wished for Snapdragon,  but for daily use it runs well.

The only problem i hv come across is heating. Its not over heating, just little increase in temperature.  This happens only while playing high spec games like PUGB. It is not problem , just mentioned it just in case.

Overall, for people who are looking for a decent gaming and daily use phone. This Samsung Galaxy M31 is my recommendation to you.

Highly satisfied with the looks of this phone..... camera is great but still trying to figure out what to do with macro mode.... performance is a bit compromising but still can't say it's bad in this price..... previously I was using Samsung M30 which had 5000mah battery but in that Battery lasted more than in this device.... would highly recommend to try this phone.....It can actually be called upgraded version of M30.....üòö I like it because of its display, camera and looks.... performance could have been more efficient but still it's good enough for daily use and gaming also. It has letest version of Android so hopefully it'll get newer versions of Android sooner in comparison of other devices running on older versions of Android.....In M30 also got upgraded versions quickly

Samsung has been doing quite well with m-series smartphones. The newly launched Samsung Galaxy M31 is a really good phone. If you have a budget of ~15000/- then you can definitely go for this phone. Performance, battery life and camera quality is better than Xiaomi smartphones.

Has been a Redmi user for long but switching to Samsung is one of the best decisions i ever made.

Pros- Extraordinary Camera-I wanted to take a handicam as I am a Teacher and wanted to record videos for students but i suppose i don't need to spend on anything else.
2. Zero heating- Redmi's heating issues bought me here and i suppose i made a great choice.
3. Processor- I have downloaded high intensity games like asphalt, Pubg to kill Lockdown boredom and i see absolutely no lagging and heating.
Ps- I multi-task like hell yet its greatüòä
4. Battery life is love. A proper Full charge lasts above one and half dayüòäüëç

Cons- Initially felt It charged a bit slowly but then realised its done to save its battery from damage and i feel fine.

So i have been using this phone extensively  for 4 days I decided to buy this phone as I consume a lot of YouTube content so screen and battery life was important to me so I chose this phone moreover something strange with this phone is that it gives me up to 1mbps speed on my jiofi(I live basically in middle of a forest..so that's great for me ) and cellular quality is top notch and the UI is just awesome also camera is top notch and all sensors are superb

To talk about cons sinc it uses exynos 9611 chipset u cannot expect a great gaming experience u can still game at high graphic setting but with mild frame drops I have tried pubg, asphalt 9 etc on this on medium settings this phone works like charm

So overall this phone is a great buy if u are stepping from other brands(previously was using a note 7 pro) but not a good upgrade as compared to M30s(almost similar)

So happy shopping

The delivery of the product was very fast, I recieved the product within 48hrs.

Fingerprint reader: Very good 5/5
Camera: camera is AMAZING!!! 5/5
Battery: 6000mah battery is AMAZING 5/5
Charging: 15W fast charging is also AMAZING
Display: the display is amazing with sAMOLED FHD+ Infinity U Display, this is the best part that I like in this mobile. 80% of the manufacturing cost goes on the display of the mobile. SAMSUNG display is world famous.

It is  really a Monster M31.
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Well the Samsung Galaxy M31 is awesome phone. The 64 MP camera captures stunning  photos during day however you cannot zoom in 64 MP during capture. The camera quality is really awesome. Super Amoled screen is good and the quality is really amazing , it's  screen doesn't feel like you are looking at a screen. It feels like it's  a picture and your eyes never tired of it like it used to be in LCD screen. The fast charger provided is fast enough and charges at 1% per min. The huge 6000Mah battery is really Monster and last for 2 days for a normal user. I'm  really happy to buy such an amazing phone.

However I would like Samsung to include selfie capture just by using fingerprint  sensor , this is the only thing it is lagging and everything in One UI is amazing.

Daily Data Notification Missed
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Will be super great if there is an notification for daily data usage which synchronizes with data plan chosen by customer on any network provider (not on wifi network) and recycles on daily bases. So that We do not need to worry if the daily data limit is over or getting close to daily quota limit, also we can be tension free especially while having work from home (lock down period) or other heavy data utilizing time.

Sorry to say this but right now mobile looks like riding a car or bike without knowing the petrol limit.

Hope to have this feature in future updates.

Very bad quality if someone is give me this phone in free I will not take it

1.0 out of 5 stars

Mobile quality is very bad, heating issue, network issues, changing problem and camera quality is so bad, phone is looking like too old.

I have called many time to Amazon from first day and they didn't solve my issue.
Layout/user interface is very bad
-----
Good to buy
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Its a good product,  if you are Samsung fan or looking to buy Samsung mobile, M31 is recommended in this price range. Good Camera, 6000mh battery is enough to sustain for 1.5 days. Great display, dynamic colors, looks premium with a high quality case.

Audio Sound can be better.
-----
Justifies it's tag of MEGA MONSTER.
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
The ultimate phone to have in the M series of Samsung.
As I have already been a user of M30s, I can very accurately describe I went for M31.
Besides the usual camera upgradation from 48MP to 64 MP (rear) and 16MP to 32MP (front) , I find M31 simply more responsive and compatible under my fingers. Besides a 6GB internal system storage and Android 10 OS gives you the feeling of a powerful machine in your hand.
Plus you get the whole package of 6000mAh Battery, 6.4 super amoled display and cool design that gives you the feeling of a premium smart-phone.
Well in nutshell, I can say this phone is a serious winner under the category of budget phone with all premium specifics and a sure thing to hang on to once you buy it.
Happy to buy it from Amazon, super-fast, hassle free delivery.
Word of Advice- Also buy a protective display glass and back cover to give your phone an ever-lasting long life.

Samsung Galaxy M31 - Best of the Best
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
The Best Ever Battery and Camera for limited budget..üí•üí• Hope Samsung produces more new smartphones on this process with battery n camera .. The 1st Best Thing in Samsung M31 is  CHARGE almost lasts for 2 DAYS. The 2nd Best Thing is the yr MP Camera is very much better to capture the pictures with Live Focus, Pro Mode, Night Mode , Food Mode, Slow Mo, Super Slow Mo and Hyperlapse. As it is mentioned M31 is a Fast Charging mobile, it takes almost 3 hrs to charge 100%. It should have alleast charged 100% within half an hr to 45 mins. Charging Time is the only backlog for M31. Please Charge it during N8 hrs. If it is charged Once, It will Surely last for 1 and Half days for Sure for regular Mobile Users. It's best to buy this Mobile especially for Low Budget Users.

Samsung M31, 128GB handset is heating abnormallylly
-----
3.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Got the handset M31_128GB on Thursday (21/05/20). Yesterday  complete data transferred and apps are installed.  Today afternoon 1.30 pm onwards handset started heating abnormally. I don't know the exact reason For heating and I am really worried what needs to be done, replace the same or refund. As it's just one day old, am not able to decide for further steps. Pls suggest
-----
Only buy for battery. Better go for Vivo/Oppo

3.0 out of 5 stars

The camera is not THAT good.. I mean the way they show it in the ads. But then again, at this price,  it's acceptable. The phone should have come with a cover cuz the metallic finish makes it slippery. The hardcover I ordered with it was of no use. I had exchanged my previous phone and got almost Rs. 5000 off  and I immediately regretted it as a lot of tools/in built functions do not exist in this phone. The only good thing which still is debatable is the battery I guess. I wish I had bought some other phone instead.

Monster level performance..
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
The product is wisely good to use daily tasks run smoothly.. app transitions were smooth . No stuttering or legs.  Display takes it all..crisp and clear with viewing angles...too good. Was so amazed by the camera picture quality . Decent pics lowlight pics were good too. Only con is the phone gets lil hot just below the selfie cam..if used for more than 10 min or on call . One ui is decent way better than touchwiz. Bloatware can be removed or disabled. Over all good phone from Samsung gives tight competition to other phones in the same price bracket. Monster battery the name says it all..more than one day or close to 2 days it can last.. gaming is smooth with lil frame drops..

Excellent for photos but not up to the mark for video recording.

"Battery life"
Samsung all phones Battery is good in this model 6000mah very special.

For my continuous use for bellow

GOOD BUDGET PHONE
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Phone is great in budget, Display is truly amazing .if you are into movies and series on your phone its give good experience .

Voice on speaker is low ,otherwise clarity is good.

Down side is exynos dont get feeling as that we get in snapdragon.
Not a gamer ,but I have tried hand on some and performance is average

Battery size claim  and performance is slight mismatch and with time and at time it feel like 4500 mph.

Any ways overall good phone

Build is good, feel is good

Get good backcover immediately or you can have fingerprints all on back of phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars

I bought this phone for 3 reasons:
- Awesome Screen
- 2 Days Battery Life Yet Easy To Carry
- Great Camera Performance

I am happy to say that Samsung M31 delivers on all the above promises.

What could have been better:
- Newer chipset although I haven't seen any lag in any normal tasks thanks to the great optimization done by Samsung folks.
- Battery charging time is a little high as the battery capacity is very hugh despite the 15W fast charging capacity.

I think it would be too much to ask for anything else from a device this good at such an amazing price point.

In short, if you want a device with an awesome screen, huge battery life and amazing camera - just go for the MegaMonster Samsung M31.

Beast with Less focus on Night Photography

5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I got the delivery of phone on 6 March.
When you first boot up the phone you will get update for February security patch.
This phone comes with One Ui 2.0 &amp; the first best part of is you can delete preloaded apps. This ui is more snappy &amp; feels like a premium phone even though it's a midrange phone.
Pros :-
1) Super amoled display with L1 certification
2) UI is more responsive &amp; can be customizable as per our need which basically give a feel of stock android.
3) Battery Backup is killer you can do the excessive task on this phone.
4)Ram Management is on point.
Cons :-
1) Photos of night atmosphere
 are not good.
2) Speaker of the phone is ok.
3) Placement of headphone Jack.
4) Slow Charging speed &amp; length of the USB cable is too short.
Though, Samsung gives good package of software's like Dolby atmos, MrOwl for unlimited cloud storage.
-----
Not as claimed but still good phone
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Software isn't  as sturdy as needed, seems slower at most of the times.
Camera is good, but not as good as claimed. Even 6/10 as claimed.
Battery charges fast enough and gives good back up.
Fingerprint sensor is ok only, while as face recognition isn't even ok.
Overnight downloading stops by itself and you need to manually turn on/off the data to keep up the downloading. Checked all the settings but the issue persists.

I guess, Phone's software needs some sort of upgrade and the phone will be perfect among all other phones of under 20k range.
-----
Not a great phone
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars

Network connection is very unstable for Wifi networks, and the phone is very slow to respond at times.
Wifi keeps dropping off for 5GHz networks especially.
Phone shuts down automatically and remains in that state for almost 15 minutes.

THE SUPERPHONE ( Mega Monster)
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I think it is the best phone under 15000/- .
Fingerprint sensor is fast and there is no issue about it. Camera quality is superb but i think if the camera's aperture were 1.7 then it will destroy every other company's smartphone in camera segment though it has very nice capacity to take very good pictures. The pics taken by it still so awesome. Atlast the battery life is very good. If someone wants to increase the battery life then they can use some tricks like blocking wifi scanning, blocking nearby device scanning , blocking bluetooth scanning,  using, dark mode, blocking unwanted notifications from the apps, using power saver mode, ultra data saver mode, and data saver mode. Then battery performance will be raise to the extreme.

Delivered within 24 hours.
Looks awesome.
Battery was 67% and lasted more than 1 day even on heavy usgae.
Camera is awesome.
Sound is good.
Display is amazing.
Mine is Ocean blue.
Loved the amoled display I'm loving my phone  and suggest  the same for viewers because on low budget you must go for this high end phone with 128 GB storage.
Love the macro photography.

Hey Everyone! Its almost upto 5 days i have been using this Flagship smartphone SAMSUNG GALAXY M31(6GB/64GB). My experience is amzing with this phone. Everything is working properly(FingerPrint sensor and other biometric locks) Camera is very clear and is making photos very stable. The most most most amazing feature in this phone is its battery lifeüë£ Even if after operating this phone for hours, playing games and using many other battery conusming apps it only falls by 10% or 15%. Best for gaming, it never overheats and no lag &amp; bug observed!
In comparison with other Smart Phones it is best budgetary phone till now on Amazonüòá
Grab this deal ASAP and have a good day!‚ù§
Thankyou for your Precious Timeüòä
Stay Safe üíØ

So I'm using this device from more than 2 months..and I can say it's definitely not that a phone which I can call a brilliant one ..battery life is good camera is good..
Fingerprint is okay but will not work if your finger is a bit wet..but overall it's good for me..
No issues of hang-up...and yes with no doubt its samsung and you can go for it..
-----
A budget phone with some of the great features..........and off course the brand and it's class
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
It has a decent camera with numerous features...........night mode is not very good it is just ok. But other features of camera do not let you feel the shortcoming of night mode.
Performance vise, it is good with fast speed and doesn't lag due to it's big ram. This phone doesn't provide bixby as A series do
Setting and notification panel provide many features  for great experience.
Biometrics is good...........1 out of 8 times fingerprint sensor doesn't recognize you but works good even with wet hands.......face lock is also decent.
The features that stand out from all of these are........its screen with amoled display is simply treat to our eyes, battery charger could be more fast but still it is good, performance and classiness.................if your budget is around 15 to 16k then you can definitely look upto this mobile

Budget Beast Samsung M31

5.0 out of 5 stars

Nice move from Samsung
After SAMSUNG M30s
 M31 looks like an update Of m30s
With the price 16000
6GB128 GB

Photos are looks good taken on m31
With 64mp quad camera
32mp selfie camera takes good pictures
6000mah battery gives more comfort  to keep using more than a day-
Wifi calling option  good
Display good
Color also gives  a good look
I giving 5* because  no other mobiles  can't beat M31 within this budget
I'm a Xiaomi Redmi fan for the last 6 years
Mi3,redmi note2, 3s,3sprime,redmi note 5pro, redmi 8a,at last Mi A3
I changed my mind from mi to Samsung because  of the features in this low budget
I buy m30s, and m31
Are best to buy

Feel heating  while continuously usage .
Otherwise  all best in this budget
Thanks for Samsung

Overall good phone if you are not hard core gamer just go for it
Camera is awesome back side but front side camera ok but not so good.
Battery backup is very good,but face unlock take some time if compare to other phone.
Design of phone okk and light weight, overall after updating this phone no hanging problems no heating problems.if you want this phone to watch movies it gives almost 10 hour.this phone deserve 4 star but I think after some update samsung will fix the face unlock time duration.overall good samsung phone

Average phone from Samsung

4.0 out of 5 stars

Writing this review after 10 days of usage.
Pros:
Amoled display is the highlight of the phone.
Camera has improved when compared to M30
Fingerprint sensor works smoothly
Call quality is commendable
Dedicated memory card is handy feature

Cons:
Phone frequently getting stuck in Samsung logo boot screen ,software not stable!!!
Not a phone for gamers
Over heating while charging
Delicate Plastic body,so cover is a must
6000 mah battery will last 1 day only, don't expect more. Software optimization is not as good as miui for killing or hibernating background apps.Do to this ,battery drain is more.

Must buy phone

This phone has Very good display. Sound quality is decent. Camera and Battery are excellent and in day to day life phone is very easy to use and doesn't feel heavy. Thanks to the Samsung UI all my with Android Q it's clean and simple. Speaker is not so loud. Fingure print reader is fast. I also played many games like asphalt 9 and did face any lagging issue because of 6 GB ram. Multitasking is very well handled. The body is little delicate so you need a protective case. Overall it's a good phone and also made in India.

Very good super amoled display, customized camera to AI beauty mode myself, very smooth processor more than enough for multitasking,we can easily uninstall bloatware, amazing Dolby Atmos music background,fast face unlock even in dark night,finger sensor added advantage and fast as well,nice wide angle selfie, super slow motion video recordings,4k videos recording, default assistive touch inside settings to avoid physical buttons, attractive infinity U display,6000mah battery huge boost for display and avoid frequent charging which last for full one day on Heavy usage, moderately for 1.5 day, customizable user interface,clear call quality without any frequent  drops,snappy 6gigz/128gigz....worth for 16k.... real megamonster

Very poor performance of all Samsung mobiles all have hang problem
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I am using Samsung mobile since last 3 years. First one was J7 pro second A70 now Now M31 but all processor works in same way. You can't imagine some time it's take 10 second to connect the call after receiving so conclusion is that it doesn't matter you spend 15k or 60k in Samsung mobile the problem of hang will remain same. Very Poor performance just wastage of money.

People before buying this phone I suggest to read this ...Their is a serious video and music lag or fast forward of voice n music..there is major issues in sound quality..these is the honest review..n camere is ok..phone also looks good...but issue is sound in video and music , n in YouTube etc. and more over another major issue is Bluetooth (apple AirPods)there is serious lag of sound and breakage of sound

Initial product review - 1. the battery easily lasts for a day with mobile data on for the most part.
2. The 64 MP main camera produces amazing pictures with good balance
3. The new processor works buttery smooth with multiple apps running simultaneously.
 4. Also a type C otg adapter would have been appreciated
5. I would have loved to see Samsung release a matte black version of the phone, but the glossy "space black" still looks pretty good

Amazing Specs. Worst Performace. Absolutely Worst Phone.
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I bought this phone on Day 1 of Sales. Excited, but Excitement didn't last long.

2nd Day started seeing issues like it hangs a lot, becomes non-responsive for almost 10 min and has to force restart every time. So requested for replacement. Got replacement after a couple of days, hoping this would not be defective.

This also started hanging on the first day itself. I think its a software issue.

It suddenly becomes non-responsive, you can hear calls coming in, but can't receive them, the screen becomes off, it won't turn on for the next 10 min or more. I have missed many calls like this.

On the paper, the specs and price are absolutely amazing. Now I realize why the phone is sold at lower prices.

Please let me know if any of you also faced the same issues.
-----
All pros with only cons... Galaxy M31
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
I am giving 4/5 stars, one star less for not having folder lock feature.

I like this phone, it's working smooth like butter, it's camera, battery, processor are great and it is handling multitasking pretty well, it has great battery backup too. I am not a pro gamer so for me it's more than sufficient for daily working.
The only cons with this phone is that it is not having folder lock or app lock feature. To get his feature, we have to install third party app. Providing folder lock in this phone would have added more security features for users.

I was not so happy with the last samsung phone i used in 2013 and all these years i was using other brands and finally i decided to buy Samsung galaxy M31 6GB, 128 GB version..i had compared with other phones in this segment including realme, redmi, vivo and oppo.after a lots of home work i went for this one and in simple words it is amazing.in terms of performance, display and battery , its simply the best i would say. Finger print reader works very nice..its fast too.and even face recognition  works fast. The siper display is to he mentioned.and no heating problmes so far.and camera 64 MP back cam offers very good photo experience and 32MP selfie cam is also mind blowing. Battery life is to be mentioned in double inverted comas.its really awesome. It stays for almost one and half days. Multi tasking works very nice.In short as the name suggests, its a monster..i love the new Samsung galaxy M31 experience

If you really want quality then you should go for it super amoled display is too beautiful to handle so that's why if you really really e looking for a product which has beauty E and quality and battery backup then you should really go for it however I like 5 inch smartphones screen I am bothered that's why Samsung has not made of phone of smaller display thank you friends

WORST CAMERA AND BUILD QUALITY. JUSY FANCY SPECS

Worst camera set up. Insanely thick and cheap built. Not returning cos it was gifted to someone and am kinda embarrassed.
‚Ä¢ ANCIENT CAMERA QUALITY
‚Ä¢ VERY THICK
‚Ä¢ CHEAP PLASTIC BUILD
Several other options with no such FANCY/TOO PROMISING SPECS.

I myself use two Galaxy Notes but now I have a different impression on SAMSUNG.

Good Product with a decent performance and camera
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Why are some of the reviews mentioning poor camera etc? There is nothing much wrong with this phone. It is a good product and should be a smooth companion for an year at least.

P.S&gt; I don't play games on my phone. I wanted a great display (AMOLED), decent performance, good camera and a reasonably decent battery life. I got what I wanted and if you want the same, go for it too. Do buy a good case along with the phone because Samsung has not given a case inside the box.

Before i bought this product I've checked a lot of reviews and as everyone said it's good for people who consume a lot of media i went ahead and bought this.. This phones got one of the best displays in this price segment.. it's an awesome experience to watch movies and shows in this phone. And with the amazing battery backup of 6000mah we can watch shows continuosly for hours. The camera quality is also really awesome. I love everything about this phone except the charging speed.. it takes me around 3 hours to fully charge. I wish they would have added a much more faster charger instead of that 15W. Also sometimes the face unlock is bit slow or unresponsive. But as a whole i absolutely love this product.

Bang for your buck

The phone is really a mega monster and well worth the price. 128GB and 6GB RAM, 6000mAh battery along with a decent processor and camera is a steal at this price range. But my camera seems to have a problem where all the corners of the photo except a central circle become blurry and so i cannot take a whole picture of even a page. It might be a hardware problem in my device or it could be a software problem as well. Besides this issue the phone works great.

Cheating  for amazon products

Only battery  is best and camera  is very  poor quality  and fingerprint  reader is slowly  processing  and camera front and back camera is totally  wasted  that Samsung  M31product so overall  this mobile  worth of 15000 thousand  so I feeled tham for waste of my money these amazon products  was cheating  for me thus duplicat products  for delivery for me so I was complaint  for court I already asked  to replacement  policy that amazon customer doesn't  respond  for me and another  one time call doesn't  responds  that sir was tell replacement  policy not accepted tell so totally  Amazon products  was cheating for ever one people I was share that the a duplicate  product  for amazon for WhatsApp ,Instagram, Facebook,and ect  so be carefully  to order  for amazon totally  cheating ever one .

Don't think twice if you stumble upon M31, because it's best.

4.0 out of 5 stars

Nice product within 16K, although when compared with other options available in market this might not be immediate choice but believe me you will not regret being an Owner of Samsung M31.

Amazing quality of camera have already made me cameramen within my circle and a selfie geek, Battery is as promised, works whole day with just 50% with extensive use of GPS and WIFI and well as internet. What more can be asked for 16k when you are getting 128 GB and 6 GB memory with perfectly great fingerprint sensors and face lock.

Only cons I found: Weight should have been a bit less and size is not very much comfortable with skinny pants.

Overall, best handset in recent times and would always be looking for new models of Samsung within this price range. Good luck Samsung.

Just an average phone...phone can't handle on its own the software glitches unlike Mi &amp; Asus phones.
A system update made the phone dead and now I want to return the product and buy a different phone given the lockdown situation in the country and all its service centres closed.

Please suggest what should be done?

Updated review:- stars updated from 3 to 4.
The samsung team responded well and recovery of my dead phone was made possible. Phone is working pretty ok since then except the battery unit in it. The battery efficiency has fallen since then.
Had the problem not happened, this phone deserved a generous 5 star. üëç

Heat issue++++ &amp; under quality front cam... ( Front cam Just like a 12 micromax cam)
-----
3.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Am only writing the cons:-

1.) Front canera quality 5years backward..(its a quality with 12MP micromax camera instead of 32 MP)

2.) HEATING ISSUE IS THERE... ALMOST UPPER ‚Öì HEATS LIKE ANYTHING....( EXYNOS chipset is poorer, past experiences from many users..i personally rely for a Snapdragon chipset... )

But This time i overestimated exynos &amp; i fail...

*Exynos is a samsung made chipset cheaply produced but most performed chipset are always with Snapdragon thus the phones they possess...

Exynos 9611 used in..14k galaxy m31...24k galaxy a31 and goes on i donno what they mean by this.. unusual distribution...

3.) Facial recognition takes time far poorer than my poco f1 but fingerprint scanner is ok but not that fast still ok...
-----
Without any doubt Go for M31

Display-Super Amoled. Best in class. You will love it.

Front camera is not up to mark. But overall good quality.
Processor - I am  not  heavy user.  It performs daily  tasks  very well.

Battery- It gave me almost 4 hours screen time from 52% battery and 15% battery is still left. So it is excellent.
Software- One Ui very best.. many customization options.

Also, I've got some issues with network hope it will be fixed in next update.
Samsung's knox security is missing.
Samsung please check for above and fix in next update as soon as possible.

On the 11th day of delivery  of phone, sound of main speaker  get down. I don't know why but it's not very low. Even I can't hear the ringtone. Over all phones built quality is awesome as well outstanding camera performance.

Its everything that the advertisement says!

5.0 out of 5 stars

Considering how much it costed me and the brand I invested in , I very happily and confidently say that this phone is precisely everything that the advertisement say about it.  It's been 12 days since I bought this handset and so far I have never run out of battery. My son and I both, have been playing pubg for hours and though there are super minor glitches which one can easily ignore..this phone has been awesome. The camera and finger print sensors are super fine and quick.

The phone appears more worth than its value to me.

If you are planning to  buy a handset, go for M31 without even a single doubt in mind.

Best camera and touchscreen
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
The camera quality is really exciting with 64 MP quad camera capturing almost all details. The macro and wide angle options makes it outstanding for this price. However, sometimes when required to take fast actions, focus is being lost. Autofocus is not so quick as well.  32 MP front camera is a beast!!!
The smoothness of display and screen is highly appreciable and commendable and this will be the best in this price range.
Finger print reader should have been onscreen and the case could be ceramic or metalic which are being offered by other manufacturers for this price or lower.
Eventhough it is claimed to be 6000 mAh, draining of battery is quick and you need to recharge once in a day.
Unexpected crash of apps is also observed within one week of time.

As a mountain  guide I always go for  a phone  with  a big batteries, since  there  is limited  chance to find  wall sockets.  So I found  this phone perfect do those  who live  off the grid's.  Plus  the camera it takes  perfect photograph,, thanks to Samsung now I don't  have  to carry  my bulky  DSLR every time  I go to an expedition. Above  are the  two main features I have  been  looking from a smartphone, screen  visibility  was also great when I was at glacier. Samsung  should transform this phone  into a Rugged  smartphone. And one more thing,  Image stabilizer during  video capture  was amazingly  smooth.
Thanks Samsung
And thanks  Amazon  for its super fast  delivery.

Samsung M31- Pros &amp; cons
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Samsung M31 is a Best quality product having  the great performance and built quality is also good with the latest Android 10

 That is available in chipest price.

M31's comes with 64mp quad camera and 6.4 Amoled display are amazing.
Camera comes with lots of modes like
Slow motion, super-slow-mo, live focus,  macro shot, night mode, ultra wide shot &amp; many more filters.

 3 stars to it's battery life
Because  while using phone it releasing  heat.
Samsung  announced  that the new M31 will come with 6000mAh battery although the performance  is good but battery life is not satisfactory.
In other hand i will say that it has the 6000 mAh battery  but the charger  is 15V that is not suitable  to charge a heavy battery.
-----
Worth Buy

Recently I purchased Samsung Galaxy M31 on Amazon. I have been using this phone for past 2 weeks and here are my feedbacks.

Pros:
Color of the phone is really cool and looks awesome.
Loading of apps is faster
Front and Back camera is really good and output of the pictures are excellent during the day-light.
Audio quality using headphones gives you a different experience altogether.
Battery life lasts for 48-72 hours, if you are a regular user. If you are heavy user it should last some where between 23 to 36 hours.

Cons:
Pictures taken in night mode is decent.
The phone gets slighted heated when you are using for a longer duration.

Well no doubt indeed it was one of the most awaited mobile phone of 2020 and I must say It was worth it ,6000 mah battery , 64mp camera and many more cool and latest features
But there was one minute areas where I believe the creature should have taken care of
  - length of data cable
No doubt the charger is a fast charger still it would have been appropriate if the length of cable was bit longer
Last but not the least as a Samsung user I never get tired of bragging the level of service you provide us at your service centre ..pls keep it like this always

I am very happy to review on my recent purchase Samsung M31 mobile phone.
Performance is very Good as it is having Octa core processor with 6 GB RAM.

The Display is Super Amoled with 6.4 inch screen which is fantastic &amp; I can say that No other phone comes closer in this budget segment.

The highlight of the mobile is its Camera, possessing Quad camera of 64+ 8 + 5 + 5 MP Primary Cameras &amp; 32 MP Front Camera. The attached photos are taken from this phone as the font size is so small to read, Phone helped me in reading see the clarity.

Now I will give 5 rating for its monster Battery of 6000mAh

Why I strictly Recommend others to go for this phone because of its lowest SAR value.

Overall my rating is 5.

Amazing phone at budget price

Phone is a steal at current price, giving best specs in the range and lots of features.  Samsung has really worked and delivered a product which exceeds market expectations.
Samsung has done amazing job on the latest One UI. It is more intuitive and fast. Also, it works very well with all sorts of apps.
Of course, the camera is exceptional,  especially its  64MP mode which has good detailing.
The display also looks excellent as it's super amoled which was only available in higher end models until now.
Holding and using the phone is also very easy due to sleek design and less weight even with the mega battery. The battery backup is amazing,  giving me 2 days battery life on single charge with good usage.
Definitely worth every rupee.

I bought m31 as soon it was launched. Excellent  worth to the price. Camara front 32mp excellent I use for zoom meeting my clients call me said my picture is ver clear and sharp asking what brand phone I am using?. Back 64mp main camara excellent awesome and amazing photo are very sharp with out breaking when it zoomed  I purchased M4l31 for taking video shooting. Video shooting as clear as taking professional  video camara.
Regarding finger print is just one soft touch unlock phone and faster.
Battery (6000MAH) is wonderful. My daily usage in zoom and video conference call at least  3  hours at full charge battery usage only half from full charge. In week ends battery listing today's in single full charge. Worth for the price. I am happy on m31

Yesterday I received one. Very gooddesign to carry. It seems light weight.
I was little disappointed with packaging because brown box packing was not proper so we felt that may be somebody tried to replace something from the box. I was little disappointed when not found Head Phones inside box in Samsung Product. Camera quality is good. Overall very good battery life, fully satisfied

4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
This phone is really good in day to day tasks. But it's processing power is not that good, sometimes it overheats while playing heavy games such as call of duty mobile and pubg mobile. As for the camera quality the daylight photos are crystal clear but the night photos are a bit blurry if you have shaky hands. Battery will last 1.5 days more or less and 2 if there is no Ga(y)ming involved. Oh and this phone probably has the best screen under 20k I haven't seen the other phones but this one is an one of a kind. There are some other small features that makes the phone easy to use too, so over all 4.5 out of 5 because of over heating during gaming and the rest is ten out of ten.
-----
Best at this range with good build quality and gives feel of mega monster at every step of usage.

This new Samsung beast is monster in every aspect i.e., monster 6000mah battery, monster 64MP main rear camera, monster super amoled full HD+ display, and many more.. This new monster is very slim and very easy to handle and use. 4 different camera lenses helps us to captureevery type of shot as we seek in a perfect manner.
Other phones Samsung don't give 6000 mah battery with the 64 MP camera and super amoled full HD display altogether at this rate.
15W fast charger takes almost 1.5-2 hours to charge this big batteryvwhich lasts for almost 2 days with normal internet and other uses.
So one must go for this M31 because at this price, this is the only one phone in this segment which provides customer all types of major functions at this rate.

Plz don't buy this phone. Just after 12 day purchase, mobile stopped working. When I visited service centre, service engineer told me that operating system has been corrupted. They update the OS and mobile starts working. Then again after 8 days mobile stopped suddenly. When I visited service centre engineer told me that this mobile has serious issues with OS. Now this time it took 1 week to update. This is ridiculous Samsung. Why New mobile has this much problem. Nobody from Samsung is responding not on mobile or not in email. This is what you called international brand. To hell with that. Plz plz don't buy this set.

Display kills

5.0 out of 5 stars

I was tempted to write a review a few weeks after I bought this phone. I have been MI phone before. With some research and my requirements I bought this. I'm not disaapointed.
What is good about this phone? The camera is superb. The battery is superb. But what I like the most is the display. With MI phones in the same prize range, the display of Galaxy M31 is much much better.

Cons:
Less OS features. Many of the software features are found missing in this phone. For example, short cut for taking screen shot doesn't work as desired. Facial recognition is a tat slow.

Overall: 4.5 out of 5

I used for some photos. It appeared just natural colour And wonderful images. I use multi-tasking without any interption. I am happy with Samsung's Galaxy m31. Battery is really what I was looking for. If you just travel for a couple of days, you really don't need to battery charge. Thanks for a giant battery.
Thanks to seller and Amazon for providing best service and products.

Well its my first time using a Samsung android phone. To be honest I wasn't expecting that good device. I wanted a phone with good battery with a great display and m31 is a total banger om this one. The battery lasts for 2 days and the amoled screen is amazing. Apart from screen and battery this packs a great deal of utility. Samsung one ui is awesome, tbh I'm loving this. I've played cod and mcoc on this and they run quite smooth.
Talking about some not so exciting feature is camera quality, on paper they look great but in original the camera is less sharp it's beautifys and soften the image. And yes it's little bit chunky in terms of weight. And yes it takes a long time to charge.
Overall its a great deal.
9/10 recommended.

6000 mAh  battery  . 32MP  front  camera. 64MP+8MP+5MP+5MP  rear  camera .Also  has  samsung  latest  ui  .  and  6  gb  ram  ,128  gb  storage.  In  16000 rupees ,  you  can't  ask  for  more.  Really , I  like  Samsung galaxy M31 . If  you  are  looking mobile for  watching  series  and  movies , Samsung galaxy M31 is  nice  . If  you  are  looking  for  gaming , Samsung galaxy M31 is  good, although  you  may  look  for  another  smartphones because Snapdragon is better  than Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9611 in  some  points. In  comparision  with  other  samsung  smartphones ,Samsung galaxy M31 has  one  disadvantage  that  Samsung galaxy M31 has  front  gorilla glass  3  and  no  rear  glass  while  some  samsung  phones  have  rear  glass.

I would say this is the best smartphone at around 15000 rupees .
6000mAh battery is its USP. I watched two movies online back to back and still 60% of battery was available. With fast charging 6000mah battery takes a bit time but that is reasnable. 64 MP camera is mind blowing with for different types of camera you can click different  quality images. Its been two days I have bought this phone and surely I am in love with it. 6GB RAM is enough to play any mobile game like ping or free fire or any other.

I bought the mobile on March and have been using for the past 3 months.. I am a tehnological addict who would keep on changing mobile once in 6 months... Previously I was using Oppo F11 and  being unsatisfied with the specs of that model, I bought this device.. I am extremely happy about this device as the phone is really superb and an excellent choice for normal and heavy usage.. Battery back up is massive and no need to worry even if you play heavy graphics games and You don't need to carry a power bank or charger even if you happen to halt in a place for 2 days .. Display and Camera quality are awesome and comparatively better than other mobiles at this price segment.. My friend is using iPhone 7 plus and he is asking my m31 as exchange to his iPhone...I really love the Pixel and display clarity.. You can blindly buy the mobile without any negative thought...

Phone is worth at this price range. Comparing to the phone i have used before like Nokia, the cameras of Samsung galaxy M31 is missing details in the pictures, but is good in low light. Overall the the cameras are really good compared to other Samsung phones in this price range. I love the full black body, when the phone is used in dark screen mode, it absolutely a great feel of having very nice gadget at hand - Hats off to the design here. Ofcourse, the display is superb. And battery life is really a plus on this phone. A great product to own! Though, the charger i recieved in the box is defective, its not working, i had to use my other chargers to charge my phone because i didn't like to exchange my phone just for the defective charger.

Samsung M31 usability review
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
It's a good phone. While switching from my previous phone - Nokia 6.1, I could say a little disappointed, considering the usability aspects - Single hand operation, Holding comforts etc.
Before purchase this do evaluate Redmi 9 pro too. It's a close match.

Pros :
Fingerprint reader is good. Comparing with Redmi 9 pro in which sensor is embedded in lock button, I didn't experience a usability concern because of face unlock.

Amazing display

Compettative spec at this price point for a flagship
Good battery life

Samsung galaxy usability apps - Better than Android one experience

Cons :
Heavy and bulky in hand ( Larger display)

Not looks premium like Nokia

Heating up issue with mobile

2.0 out of 5 stars

Hi, I have raised a concern already about heating up of device. When I am on call, mobile gets heated up very much and I am facing sever pain below my left ear.
After stating all this over the call (I used my old mobile to call), Amazon team has asked me to do troubleshooting and diagnosed my mobile when I was not using my mobile and  the result showed under control temperature of the device. I am shocked that even I stated so many times about my physical pain, they are not ready to place a request of return/replacement.
I urge you to please support here. I am not able to see any other option to return it.

Going forward, I would not be ordering anything from Amazon and will also suggest my friends and family too.

Looked up many reviews  and purchased Samsung M31 as I was convinced that this is the phone with the most robust battery. Nothing else matters at the end of the day if you don't have  enough charge left. So this phone really fit pls the bill. The photos are crystal clear and the the 4 cameras at the back give you several options for the same.But this phone, shut off the unnecessary notifications,  put a slick black screen to help save your power.The wide Amulet display makes watching movies and ott platforms a pleasure.
The sound from.the speakers are good and equally great on the headphone. Turn on the Dolby atmos if you have to giving you options for music, movies or sports. A great value for money at around 16000 rupees.

One of the best phones available for that price
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
The specs is incredible on paper and when I bought it and actually tested it, most of the specs hold good. The camera quality and features are very good though it may take some time to focus on the object dynamically. Normal without zoom 64MP shots are amazing and so is Macro &amp; ultra wide. Though when zoomed the quality goes down drastically. Charging speed and battery life are decent enough and haven't seen heating issue until now. The number 6000mah maybe bloated up but the battery performance is good enough for a common user. The AMOLED display, security features and Samsung apps/shop/members are top notch! Overall, the best common use phone you can get for this price.

PS: the metal back of the phone is amazing!

Camera quality is 3rd class.
64MP is like 06MP &amp; 32MP is like 03MP.
Pixel quality of photo is very bad.
6K monster battery is myth. Battery backup is very poor. 15W charge is very slow.
Face unlock is slow.
Don't buy any mid range phone of Samsung.
It is waste of money.
I want my money back from Amazon.

A WFM Phone !

The finger print reader lacks a bit in the reading and is a bit clumsy. Maybe more functions like M30 could be added with the finger print reader over here as well. The camera is a bomb with amazing clarity in all aspects. After all its Samsung, the cameras are always amazing. The battery life if you say is 23 hours maximum with all possible activities, videos, games, calling, video calling , zoom meetings and if the net is not used, then the battery backup stays for as good as 30+ hours. A great WFM phone, amazing features. Maybe, there could be a system update for lagging a bit even after having 6GB RAM for keyboard application. But rest all, is amazing.

The pros and cons
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
The phone is 100% value for money but it would have been far better if the Samsung had used good built quality. The finger print reader is working fine. There are so many modes in camera which I think is so cool for clicking pictures and the camera quality is much better. Well you are getting a 6000mAH battery in this one, one shouldn't be complaining about the battery life atleast. The  cons of this phone is that Samsung should have given a higher watt fast charger which is only 15 watt fast charging and the back side of the phone gets scratches all over it if you  clean the phone with a soft cotton cloth only. The backside would have been much better if they have used glass. All over the phone is best in this price range.

2) Camera is fabulous in each and every mode.
3) Battery life as defined by the tag is a mega monster.It easily lasts the whole day with heavy usage and can last two days with light use.
4) The display is amazing,it is an awesome experience watching HD videos on the SuperAmoled display.
5) The always on display feature that Samsung has provided is appreciable.
6) Dolby Atmos gives a magical music experience.
7) The light weight design with such a big battery says all about the intelligent designing of the phone.

Dislikes:
1) The face recognition is a little disappointing as it does not work up to the expectations.It takes little more than the normal time to unlock phone with this.
2) The wifi connectivity is a little slow

Currently touch screen of the cellphone is not working, with in 1.5 months, I am very disappointment with the quality of the cellphone, in this lock-down situation, How customer care team will help for replacement.

As I am Samsung customer since 18 years, I would like to hear from team immanently for solution.

Not for gamers, who have interested to play heavy games

I am using M31 (6GB,128GB), the performance is good but there is some problems:
1. Experience Heating problem, while playing heavy game like PUBG for more than 1 hour on the upper part of the phone.
2. Sometimes freezing of samsung keyboard.
3. Gyroscope is not much Sensitive as compare to other brand phones.

At last phone is good, not better choice for gamers.

üòÄü§óüòçüòòThis phone will definitely a winner under 20k segment phones. My honest review after 4 days usage.

1.Excellent Back &amp; Front Cam, PFA pics here.
2.Display moulded edges &amp; sAMOLED nice.
3.Big Battery, good backup for 2 days with mobile data on.
4.Performance is Above Average i would say. Still i didn't remove the cover so after removing the plastic cover, it would be better..
5.3 slots are sd card.. i bought only 64gb.
6. Normal ram usage is 3gb and 3gb free for heavy users
7.speaker is above avg.
8. Mobile weight is medium and slim.

I will give 4.5 rating. (Finger print could have been moved to front or side). I hope it will long last for 5,6 years...üòçüòòü§ó

Samsung galaxy M31 is sleek enough to manage with one hand and the I personally am fond of Samsung keyboard,it can be really used with ease when compared to any other phones of other brands. The battery lasts longer than other samsung phones like M30/M30s.The camera also gives us variety of quality shots ,the top most being 64Mp(the detailing of this shot is unbelievable) and also the price is so affable too .Its a big time deal and real one too as I can get a phone from  SAMSUNG with affordable price

I regret buying this mobile. it is much slower then my earlier samsung on nxt mobile. Also on this phone the network bar for vodafone network shows only 2 lines whereas on my other mobile it shows full network of vodafone. Worst phone . I suggest people not to go for this phone. It is definitely not a 6 gb ram phone. 6 gb ram is only on papers and not actual.

One week review
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Okay so I bought the phone on the day it was released. The review is based the first week usage of the phone.
1. Starting big just like it's battery. The 6000 mAh battery last for a day and half on moderate to high usage of the phone.
2. Camera - the quad cam setup impresses more than one can expect, specially the 64 MP mode.
3. The sAMOLED screen is blessing to the eyes. Brightness is no isssue even out in the sun.
4. With it's 6gb ram one can just stop worrying about the lag.
5. Even though it doesn't have a glass back. It still gives a premium feel.

And with the brand like Samsung it is a must go phone under 15k.
-----
Affordable, true powerhouse performer with stunning looks, 64 MP Quad Camera good for all occasions.

Tha Galaxy M31 is probably the greatest piece of design &amp; engineering excellence by the Global Smartphone leader -Samsung for its new/repeat purchase Galaxy users.

Having used the M31 for 5 days now I would love to share my user experience. Every aspect of this phone is unique, the hardware, software and the OS has been engineered par excellence and over delivers on its promise and commitment.

For non Galaxy users possibly this is the best possible opportunity to own this powerhouse phone at such an appealing price point.

Kudos to the Amazon India Team for the Product Management, planning, sales, marketing &amp; logistics support rendered with before time delivery of this amazing product.

I bought one week back. The product is flawless. Build quality is good,amoled display make it equal to flagship version. Go for 64 GB if u already have SD card. If you already have Samsung phone you can easily transfer everything through samsung smart switch feature.
Battery holds good if you don't use this phone as hotspot all the time.

Touch sensors are good and speakers are fine.

Do not have any complaints so far except keyboard input seems lags at time hopefully some updates in future fixes it.
15k worth mobile n its worth it!!

Should appriciate the effort made by samsung on M31,
If u are a tiktoker, vlogger, camera lover, this phone is for you
There are many phones with good cameras and yes better than Samsung M31 but you will not satisfy as this beast make you satisfy with the features like super slowmo, slowmo, macro, nightmode etc
The best part is, the person who doesn't like his face or he is camera shy and loves doing vlogs, AR emoji will help him to creates his face and you can do video on it.
With AR emoji u can do some awesome tiktok as well.
You can visit my tiktok ID for videos @hemantmachani

Also appriciated Amazon quick delivery, not a prime member but still i received this phone in 2 days.

Excellent price point.
Display is excellent.
Very fast processor.
Fingerprint reader is fast and accurate for the price point.
Camera is excellent. Sharp and accurate colors and image reproduction.
Battery Life is awesome. It lasts about 18 hours on hevay usage.
Microphone placement is some issue. Many times finger accidentally covers it, leading to voice not reaching the person at other end of call. One has to be very careful not to cover the microphone accidentally.

Samsung Galaxy M31 Review Rating

After 15 days of usage. The phone is a good option for budget buyers who want to stick to a band. The battery life is good but not excellent. Performance is okayish considering it has 6MB RAM. Camera is decent enough.  Build quality is fine but you would need a protective back cover. Display is excellent and the best feature of this phone.

Am unable to use internet and pages are loading slower. I saw similar issues reported for M31 in Samsung community website.
My family members are having same network inserted in different mobile works really good. I have done all the troubleshooting steps which I saw in the portal. It seems like some hardware issue.
I'm planning to replace my phone. Sad that I have to return and book a new one it's very time consuming.
Apart from this all features are good.

After using 2 days I'm writing this review of Samsung Galaxy M31.
This phone is good in terms of performance and looks.
Battery is okay, it's not run that big what the company claims. One more issue is with charging. Company claims fast charging but this phone is very very slow in charging. It takes around 2 hours to full charge.
Camera is okay in 16K price.

The Galaxy M31 turned out to be the most value-for-money budget phone from the Korean giant.
Samsung has once again focused on battery capacity as one of the highlights. The Galaxy M31 has a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, the biggest we‚Äôve ever seen on any Galaxy phone, no matter which price segment it may fall in. The other notable feature on the M31 is a 64MP primary rear camera.
The Galaxy M31 also comes with a number of other camera features, like AR Emoji, Super Slow-mo video recording, a regular slow motion mode, and a Super Steady mode that uses the ultra-wide cameras to record action camera-like videos with reduced shake.

I love it .
Thanks Samsung and Amazon

Like:
Value for money
Camera quality is good
Selfie camera is nice
Battery is excellent
Display supercool
Storage of128gb is giving much much comfort.
Screen size is good for viewing videos and reading as well.

Dislike:
Image processing can be improvised
4G LTE data streaming not smooth as expected. Even though we have excellent data connection video stream's buffering or cache is not faster.

At this price and brand like Samsung is a good deal.  Also it is Made in India.

Above features and quality. I am using Apple 10 XS. Samsung A31 is really packed with loads of quality and features at this price. I am not comparing Samsung to Apple but price to features here.

Phone was too good and worth for its price.. I'm writing this review after using the phone for more than a month.. till now no issues with its battery life.. I think the time period which I used is enough to make conclusion about battery and coming to screen resolution, camera quality, sound quality, performance, browsing efficiency.. everything was good till now.. the only thing I miss was earphones and protective case.. it would be very appreciative if Samsung provides earphones and protective case like how vivo is providing.. other than that no issues.. I was happy with the mobile!!!

M31 value for money, but can get better. Released in a hurry.

Heat at the top-back of the phone sometimes, but not unbearable,  just get scared as you're gonna have to put it over the ear.
Camera is good, a little smudgy on zoom, but captures good light and colors.
Battery backup on medium use good, full charge gives a day and a half.
Sleek in the hand.
Lag in scrolling apps even with 6+128GB is noticeable.
Wi-fi-Calling very helpful.
Product info said it had sim card pin, but box did not.
Too many system updates within first 2 days of using. Some apps crashed.
So happy to have a good camera smartphone but I believe it can be better with the 15k budget.

Camera quality is very poor, 64mp image is just a joke. Mi note 8 pro has better image quality compared to this phone. Do not believe paid product reviews.
Display is good and mobile is light weight though it has 6000mah battery.

Go for it...

Short and crispy way :-
Pros -
1. Battery backup is like 2 days if you run daily activities which is very much required
2. Phone is lighter even we have a massive battery inside
3. If you have samsung forget about screen.. its always awesome.
4. Fingr print and face unlock is quite smooth without any hiccups

Cons:-
1. Charging is slow with 15W charger
2. Sluggish in multitasking even in 6gb

Overall its a nice package at this price range
-----
Good specs in the given price

Galaxy M31's camera sure lives up to my expectations. The picture quality in low light is awesome and the phone is comparatively light given the battery capacity. It took around 2.5 hours for a full charge and lasted for roughly 1.5 day on my normal usage. However, I'm a bit disappointed with the lack of IR blaster and One UI. One UI doesn't have out of the box support for things like internet speed meter and number of fingerprints that can be registered is limited to 3. Overall it's a good purchase within given price, especially if you're a camera fanatic.

Previously I had used C9 Pro compared to that M31 was little bit fast and the battery backup was too good. Both front and back camera quality was superb. Im using this m31 mobile for more than a month and usage of mobile is high, like i would use mobile around 15 hrs in a day(most of time i use it for browsing) after that I will put the mobile in charging overnight (1 time in a day). While i put it on charge in day time i have observed it was getting charged to 15% to 100% with in 2hrs for a 6000 mah monstere battery. I'm really satisfied in battery backup side and camera side when compared to my previous mobile C9 Pro.  Really worth buying.

I am using this phone from 06/03/2020.

Thank you to Amazon who delivered the product timely before proceeding to your. I made my tour memorable with this Phone after capturing good quality of camera, videos etc.

Ok first of all.
1.Do not buy the phone as they have mentioned 6000Mah Mega Battery.The battery works just half a day and is so normal. It's not even fast charging.
2.Do not even think of a good front camera.
3. The charger is not a fast charger.
Do not go for this for 16k.
4. Rest some of the features are okie.
5. Would be better if I get refund.

This Phone (Samsung Galaxy M31 6 GB+128GB) has got everything, can even punch above its weight.
No performance issues, Samsung's sAMOLED display looks the best (simply better than others), battery easily lasts a day with constant use. Cameras take great photos too.
One UI 2.0 is beautiful, lovely to use.
Overall it has been a great purchase. Great Work, Samsung.

Bought it on the launch hour. I am rating this after using it for more than two weeks. It is worth your money. I think, Samsung cameback  with a bang. Awesome  speck in this range. Don't waste your money choosing other vendors.
Both sides  Camera's are stunning.
Sound quality is very good.
Battery backup is coming for 2 days.
Initially felt bit heavy ..but now I am okay with it.
No lags at all.
 Just go for it...

This is by far the best budget smartphone I've ever used.The camera quality is amazing.The night mode on the phone works really well and it has various camera modes which are great.The gaming is also really good on this phone.Games like ping and cod work really well even on high frame rate.The battery is surely unbelieveable.The phone lasts for a long time and its cooling technology is also great.Video resolution on various OTT platforms is quite good.The charger of the phone is 15w and charges the phone at a great speed.Overall,if you're looking for a budget smartphone in the price range of 12000-18000 this is the best choice.

After using this phone for 2 month &amp; more, I am giving this review ( a short review) after viewing this you can really impress with this phone,my observations are:
1.everyone is looking for such a phone with a very good camera quality,in this phone with 64 MP camera the images are really appreciable.
2. Now I come to its battery it has 6000 mah of battery life,which lasts a long ,in my recent days I watch movies,playing games but it doesn't last.
3. Now about its look, very attractive especially it's back with superb camera design .I impressed.
4. With the given processor it doest create any hindrance while using any heavy size gaming app.

So I want to say as I experienced, it is really very impressive with this budget.
