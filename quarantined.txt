First time buying a Samsung phone and absolutely loved the experience.......the phone is 9/10 overall...The feel in the hand is really premium even with polycarbonate back...I've held glass phone and this phone doesn't feel any cheaper....Samsung didn't make any compromises with phone ...my only complain is the fingerprint scanner it takes a little swipe to unlock rather than a tap...I'm not quite used to this.....the performance in public is great too.  ...I reccomend gfx tool to achieve true 60 fps possible to GPU optimization in premium gfx tool ......the best thing about this phone is the battery ....... it's a beast and nothing can beat it in this price range....I get minimum of 8hrs of screen time in my heavy usage with the phone playing games and using social media apps.....its my new favourite phone...thx to samsung

5.0 out of 5 stars

however, there is a noticeable delay and slowness when installing new apps and also after taking a 1 minute video in highest resolution.

overall in the end, combined with 6 gb ram, the processor a potent performance combination for all types of users.

there was some minor scratches on the body and camera frame.

it has a very fast and accurate fingerprint sensor, an outstanding fed+ amoled display, a very brilliant camera, with a nec and decent exynos 9611 processor which is known for its speed and of course a very impressive 6000mah battery for 2 day's use.
