Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera,2,2,57,1
Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside,1,2,57,2
Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).,1,0,57,3

The camera quality is excellent.,4,0,61,0
The UI is user friendly.,3,0,61,1
One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone.,4,0,65,0
Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget.,4,0,65,1
"A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone.",2,4,65,2

Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more.,3,0,65,4
Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm.,2,0,65,5
Charging speed is very slow.,1,0,65,6
it took 2hrs30 mins to fully charge.,2,0,65,7
Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t.,2,0,65,8
But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone.,3,0,65,9
for pubg gamer you will notice lag in high resolution gaming,1,2,65,10
if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in smooth ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.,2,4,65,11

i have previously purchased m30sthe the signal strength was very weak so i had to to sell the phone on olx .,1,4,79,0
Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card.,3,0,79,1
I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating.,2,4,79,2
i understand that sar rating is harmful to our body brain,2,4,79,3
nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.,4,0,79,4
now coming to this phone camera is good touch responsiveness is excellent it is having wi fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website.,3,0,79,5

I was using Huawei honor phones until now because of their excellent call quality and network reception.,3,0,187,1
The features were promising but the negative reviews regarding network held me back.,2,1,187,2
by chance i happened to come across a video in couture regarding lte / 3 g / 2 g settings in the m1.,2,4,187,3
In fact the call quality and  network reception of the M21is much better than the Honor phones which I have been using for a long time.,2,1,187,4
The reason why this network issue arises is because after inserting the Sim and starting the M21 the OS of this phone selects the LTE/3G/2G (auto connect) option in Mobile networks by default.,2,2,187,5
I am using Jio Sim and Jio is only 4G.,2,4,187,6
Now if by chance the 4G signal becomes a little weak the phone will search for 3G or 2G signal and in doing so the call or network signal may drop or get cut altogether since Jio is only 4G.,2,2,187,7
So for those who have Jio Sim and have network issues I will suggest that (1) select LTE only option in Mobile networks (2) In Access Point Names open 3 vertical dots and Reset to default and immediately reboot or restart the phone.,2,1,187,9
