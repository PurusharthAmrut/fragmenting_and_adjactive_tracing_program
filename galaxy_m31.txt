Overall phone is very good in this budget  with monster battery, good camera and super Amoled display with full HD + display, and Dolby atmos sound in earphone is very  crystal clear and relaxing.
Only one thing  need to be improved default app lock is not available  .I request to Samsung  to give  S secure or other default app lock feature.

The phone is simply amazing. The Raven Black model looks gorgeous. Very sturdy. The camera quality is excellent. The UI is user friendly. This phone is similar to the Samsung range of phones, so it is hard to decide the model that's best for its price. According to my analysis, M21 is a good

Well I need a phone which can last upto a long time without charging the phone again and again but with it's 6000 mAh battery it totally met my requirements.
The Camera quality is excellent and all the basic functioning in this phone is quite impressing. Overall for those who are quite depressed with their old phone,this phone worth a shot.

Got it for‚Çπ 12699 on 15may 2020. Best value for money phone with super amoled screen. Its specs are comparable with other phones available in market on current date. It lacks fast charges inside box, takes 4 hours for full charge from zero with provided charges. Rest be assured it will not disappoint you at any front on performance and specs.

I PURCHASED SAMSUNG GALAXY M21, ON 18-MAY-2020, THE DELIVERY WAS WITHIN TIME. AFTER RECEIVING THE PRODUCT SICE LAST 5DAYS. ITS BATTERY LIFE IS REALLY AWESOME. CAMERA QUALITY IN DAYLIGHT IS  SO REALISTIC WITH TRUE COLOUR.  AND SUPER AMOLED SCREEN DISPLAY IS PRETTY COOL.

That is what is known as comeback... Many mster it really is. I watched a couple of movies and webseries and my battery still didn't get down.The camera works better than canon or Nikon. The fingerprint and the face recognition work like hell.And the best part I get it all for 12699. Way to go Samsung
Don't think have a go and be happy.

"Battery life"..
You can evalute battery life when you have full charging!!!
I am not satified with the product just want to return it, everything is good(like camera, features, finger print) but just to get 90% charge in the phone it take not less than 6-7 hours which is not adjustable for any user I feel!!

However The Smartphone is best.

Fingerprint very slow and not detecting sometime.

Excellent product !! Really the best mobile under 15k. Camera quality is amazing. Fingerprint reader is also fast. And the battery capacity is huge it lasts  a full day even for a heavy user. I recommend to buy this phone rather than going for some Chinese brands like redmi or realme.

Writing this review after using the phone for 10 days. Display, Battery, Camera all are good but the charger provided in box should have of more capacity than 15W bcoz it takes close to 3 hours to charge the phone to 100%....so it is not really a fast charging capable smartphone.

I can't believe Samsung could pack this much features in M21.
M21 doesn't feel like mid range device if you look at features.
Hands on experience is smooth, screen is premium battery life is outstanding.
I will recommend it to every Indian.

M21 is a least priced mobile having beast Exynos 9611 octaocre processor, it has same features as samsung M30s but at low cost, along with monster 6000 mah battery, one good thing about of M21 is low SAR value.

+Looks Good in your hands
+Display is great
-One drawback is the location of speaker. When your holding with both hands, one hand will cover the speakers and the sound will suppress.
Other wise very nice product.

Over all very nice
Samsung has provided a lot of customizable features wrt the UI and it really comes in handy.
Only problem I see is that the battery takes a good 3 hours to charge but that's ok considering the fact that it has 6000mah  battery

Due to plastic body, it easily catch scratches, otherwise good phone to have. One thing also i want to add is that its camera needs little more improvements in video recording and hdr mode in front facing camera.

A great phone with amazing screen and brilliant battery life. It takes fantastic photos. It is a bit heavier as it comes with a 6000mah battery. Overall its worth it if you are a regular user. But if you are looking for a gaming phone, you might find better options.

Screen color resolution are ultimate. Rest all ok.but camra is not meeting expectations. 48mp is a myth, actually it is as good as 16mp of any old Samsung version. Value for money. I am using 4 GB 64.

Camera Quality of Phone is not good to match 48 mega pixel standard.
Watching Video in hotstar is Showing poor quality. Also sefie pics taken are having white spots.
Also phone is taking some time while taking pics . Main thing is camera quality is poor.

First of all, don't buy in Amazon bcz after selling their product no return/no replacement/ no response.
Charging time is 3.5 hrs
Ringtones sound is not loud, it's very bad
No inbuilt apps like music player, app lock, screen recorder, call recorder, video player etc
Sound is bad
Look Is decent
Battery is not up to the mark
Camera is decent but flash no use
Phone is slow

After using this gadget for 1 month, I am writing this review.
So, all you guys know the main features of this Smartphone is it's Battery and it's Super AMOLED Screen also the brand value  which you are getting in this Budget Smartphone can not be ignored!
Keeping aside the brand value, you'll get exynos 9611 which is enough for you to do great things lag free. Rear Camera works brilliantly and front camera is decent. Also, you can play PUBG Lag free in (HD Ultra) settings for 1-2 hours. After that it starts heating (not a lot). But remember my advise, this phone is not for gamers, it is dor those who are in a need of feature packed budget smartphone from a reliable and trustworthy brand "SAMSUNG".

Very happy to purchase it!
Worth Buying in this price range....

Pros - Only one I.e. Amoled Display Awesome.

Cons - 1. Average Camera
  2.  Battery back up not that good
  3.  Phone heats when watching videos
  On YouTube and while charging.
  4. Processor not that fast.
Very Average Phone. PLEASE DON'T BUY.

This phone is really awsm. Having good camera quality especially front camera and battery life makes it remarkable. Amoled screen, light waight gives it two wings to fly. If you are not an intense gamer then this phone will be the best for you.
Cons:-
Charging speed, but you can use fast charger instead of the charge given to you.

Available in two colours only.

this handset is not worth of 15 k. its a waste of time and money . showing 6000mah battry but the life os battery is less than 6 hours even when not using it much. And Amazon technician is saying we can't replace it nor return it.I mean its insane. Its better to buy expensive prpducts from outlet rather than online . Amazon is good for groceries only that to be some time. If it is possible to give zero star to this product i would have given it.Disappointed with the amazon services and tgis product.

The best part of the phone is the battery the phone is 6000 MAH so they battery life is really good , it s a light weight handy phone , really liked a lot to return to the samsung , was using samsung when they used to have flip phones with a revolving camera and display of name coming at the back , and now when i use samsung those memories come back .
Hop to buy the flip model also soon ...
Nice phone

The moment I turned it on, it started over heating. While charging it heats too much. Even when talking on call the upper portion starts heating. Very disappointed with this mobile. Maybe the heating is sometimes in the limit but I think the newly purchased mobile should not have any of heating issues.

The mobile is good in an overall view. But to be specific it took around 5hr to get charged from 40% to 100%. And the most dreadful thing is that it is taking around 10min for every 1% charge. So, do we call it a fast charger?

Positives
- Monster battery life - truly. I last charged it 4 days ago and it is still showing 20% battery remaining. Admitted that I am using it lightly (only for email, whatsapp and some web browsing).
- Very nice and responsive UI (I like it better than stock android).
- Amazing camera for its price. See attached photos of close-up shots, wide-angle (taken at dusk), 2x, 3x and 4x Zoom, and night mode shot.

Negatives
- None really. It is a bit bulky thanks to its large battery - but that's not a major concern.
- It comes with Samsung bloatware (which you can't uninstall) - but this is not too intrusive (much better than Vivo and Xiaomi bloatware).

Overall - I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an awesome budget phone.

This is a highly hyped phone. Samsung launched a cheap quality, 1 year life, all in one budget phone. I have used this phone for a week now and have also spoken with some other people who have purchased it and somehow they got same experience. Sorry Samsung fans, this phone has more cons the pros.

Pros:
1. Triple camera setup. Wide angle camera gives it an edge. Covers much range than other cameras in this segment phones. Live focus or bokeh kida down market. Color mixture is just superb. You will get really live and vibrant photography outside. Samsung has made improvement in its image processing.
2. Radio: Yes it has inbuilt radio option.
3. Su Amoled: just amazing, you'll love the texture of video and picture quality.
4. Charging: Takes about 2-3 hours for full charge given 6k mah battery.
5. Clean OS. Yes for those who don't like funky UI and wants just a clean and easy going OSz samsung offers that.
6. Dedicated SIM x 2 slot. Separate memory card slot.

Cons.:
1. Camera: Has artificial bokeh programming. If you are the one who goes by detail it will disappoint you. Image with Zoom or taken while movement are just down market. So much noise.
2. Battery drains fast, give you about a day's usage support. Like a 4000mah one.
3. RAM: Guys this is where I was disappointed. Just after installing 6 apps, my available RAM space was just 1.3/4gb. Not she where all that space went.
4. The phone lage, from the very first boot it was lagging, sometimes you can experience a delay of 2 seconds in touch response. Can be fixed my software update.
5. Security patch of Feb 2020. No security patch for march of April, might be due to corona lockdown.
6. It's heavy to hold. Back shine will go in a week if you don't use a back cover.
7. Fingerprint is slow.
All and all Samsung's main USP is this triple camera setup and Super amoled display. Rest all can be found in other 11k phone. This phone won't last more then 1.5 year.

Updating my review

removing 1 star (now 4 star)

Because its automatic brightness almost doesn't work almost 70% times.

don't take too much expectations for battery life it's just more then average ( i think you can assume it has 5000 mAh battery it just my point of view ) ( as per accubattery app its has 5400 mah estimated battery capacity)

charging time 2:30 hours

fingerprint reader is accurate and fast.

camera quality also good it has scene optimizer that works great.

see i like samsung because its User Interface is best and ad free also brand value.

lets talk about performance, I'm normal mobile user like twitter, YouTube, camera etc.

i played PUBG smoothly

Samsung's super AMOLED is always Best and it can easily beat any Chinese phone worth 25K. its has High brightness.

Definitely Best choice for this price 12699

Ratings given as below:

Camera - 3/5 (Okay for normal shots, but zoom into the shot and the details look like watercolor painted. 48 MP mode is good, low light performance is horrible)
Display - 5/5 (Absolutely Gorgeous Display)
Battery - 2/5 (Never expected the drain rate to be this fast on a 6000mAh battery. Drained 20% on lowest brightness and moderate internet surfing in one hour)
Sound - 4/5 (Not very loud)
Processor - 4/5 (Good for regular use and moderate gaming, not recommended for heavy gaming)
RAM - 5/5 (6GB RAM, no issues)
Storage - 5/5 (128GB, fast storage)
Charging - 3/5 (Fast charging not fast enough and charging cable quality very poor)

Overall a good phone, but if you can stretch your budget a little bit to about ‚Çπ17000, there are tons of other better options than this.

It's my first samsung budget phone and I am totally surprised with Galaxy M21

This phone has everything as per requirement of user which is want under 15k price segment

Display: sAmoled  you can't get such type of display experience in any phone under 20k
Batter: it's huge no comments
Camera: better then Realme 6 or Note 9 pro
Processor: for me its good but heavy game user slightly disappointed
Brand &amp; Trust: Samsung  a reputed brand

I wish it should be come with glass body design but it's hands feel experience also good

Excellent Job by samsung this time

Got this mobile during the lockdown as there was no other better phone online but Samsung has degraded the quality of their phone.  The packing of the phone is poor, seems like they have provided the refurbished phone. There is dust cover over the phone and the edges have dust cover. giving a feeling of receiving a old used phone. The phone restarts automatically in every 1-2 days. Seems like there is some issue with the phone and would show its effect in the long run.  The battery says 6000 mah, but is same as 4000 mah. On full charge, it goes for 24 hrs (100% to 5%). The camera is also not up to the mark. Mi note 7 pro camera does a better job. The body of the phone is plastic made so expect scratch very soon. The network signal is also not very strong. compared samsung m21 with mi note 7 pro. If Mi 7 pro is showing 3 network tower then Samsung m21 will only show 2 tower. The sound during the call increases and decreases sometimes over call, may b network issue or may b phone issue. Also the earpiece speaker is placed in a weird position, slight movement of hand and you would not be able to hear the sound.

The major concern I am having with the phone right now is the phone restarting automatically once in 2 days and the call issue I am facing.

However, at time of lockdown you only have two options. either buy a Chinese Mi phone or buy Samsung m21 and if you have money, go for iPhone. The budget crunch made me buy Samsung m21. Hoping it does not turn into a disappointment.

This is a very balanced offering from Samsung at this price. It has a good display, great battery life, decent performance and good camera. The speaker output is bit low and the 15w charger takes long to fully charge the battery. Overall a no nonsense device that gets the job done perfectly but nothing exciting design wise. Also i think Samsung's one ui is better than MIUI or Realme os.

After one month of usage. Good product at this budget. Excellent display and battery backup. Charging is not as slow as many accuse it of and it takes a bit more than 2 hrs for me from 0-100% to charge a massive 6000mah battery. Performce is decent enough for mid level graphics and day to day functions, multimedia apps work smoothly. Rear camera is decent not great and fails short to capture details and colours vividly. Front camera does a good job. Fingerprint scanner is fast but you have to place your finger properly or firmly in middle of the scanner. OneUI needs more gestures and shortcuts for users convenience. It comes with latest update and there are no ads and is course better that ones in the same budget. Usage of durable cover and tempered glass is highly recommended as the back is plastic and a finger print magnet and screen replacement is very expensive. To conclude, if you are not a gamer, and especially for a multimedia user this is the best phone in the range of 12000-13000

I got my galaxy m21 on 25th may 2020 through amazon. I am quite impressed with the huge 6000mah battery of the smartphone obviously which tempted me to buy the same. This is giving me a battery life of 1.5days. Thankfully I'm not having any network issues in this phone still now. I'm using both wifi and mobile data and both are working fine. I travel a lot on foot and compass was a much needed one and it is very sensitive and good. Fingerprint and touch sensitivity is satisfactory. Exynos processor is not the best but this smartphone gives very much what you need for your daily needs. Camera is satisfactory and again no complaints,it gives what you needs. Amoled screen display is the most attraction of this smartphone and gives you a visual treat. Charging time is more than 2hours ,well it's having a huge 6000mah battery, so no problem. Till now no heating problem and I feel this is the most advantage of the phone. Very much satisfied with my galaxy m21üòçüòçü•∞ü•∞

I bought a 6GB+128GB variant (Black)
I like how the battery does not drain even when I use it heavily for a day. The fingerprint sensor is really good. The in-hand feel of the phone is also good. Camera is a bit of work but works well with some settings. Sound quality can be improved as when the sound grill is covered with a finger, the sound is blocked completely. The operating system is fast and efficient. Overall a really nice phone to buy if your budget is between 12k to 15k.

Was in confusion between Samsung M21 - Realme6 - Redmi Note 9 pro, but choose M21 after seeing my friends Samsung M30. And now I feel I made the right choice considering following points
* Samsung One UI - Smooth &amp; fast
* Super amoled display with Full HD resolution
* 6000 mah üîã - after Full day usage battery is around 50% including 2 hrs of PUBG playtime
* Super camera 48 MP takes very good pictures
  &amp; 20 Mp selfie camera is master in taking Selfie,
  which also have wide Selfie option.
* PUBG can be played in HD &amp; HDR Graphics.
* Biometrics are fast in unlocking the Phone.
* Lastly such good smartphone at a good price of Rs.12699- comes from SAMSUNG .

I have been using the device since 4-5 days, initial impressions are good. I always use cover andd tempered glass so looks doesn't matter that much, infact M21 looks better in a cover or case.
1. Display is crisp, clear and colourful.
2. I shifted from Motorola G6 to this, I liked ONE UI.
3. Network reception and call quality is good.
4. Music sounds better via headphones.
5. Pubg runs smoothly on lower graphics settings.
6. Camera quality is also good considering the price point, I checked the main camera only.
Battery backup is awesome, takes time to charge but lasts very long, Now I don't need to plug charger while Playing Pubg.

Overall there is everything one desires in a smartphone. For someone who wants overall good experience this device a good choice.  It ticks all the boxes.

Given the price I am very much happy that I bought it.

I have cancelled two different orders from the same range of mobiles previously. Bought Samsung M21 for my father as he didn't want anything chinese. He had Samsung A50 before. He is very happy to have the same device feeling with better camera, battery life. He could not use other A series extras as he is not very tech savvy. However, my mother's complaints grow directly proportional to his social media and binge watch time.

The only reason in purchased this phone that it's not chinese and made in NOIDA UP by non chinese company. The performance of the phone is mind blowing. Battery life is great consumed only 30% battery in first day. Having 6000 mah battery I thought it will be a heavy hone but it's not. Touch senstivity is great over all the phone is great only issue is fast charging which is claimed by samsung but I am still ok what I got. The greater thing about this phone is Samsung's sAMOLED display and SAMSUNG'S EXYNOS processor. Love the phone go ahead and buy it and stop funding china for their evil plans against humanity.

Samsung has done an excellent job in the last year or so by launching the affordable M series of phones - It has been designed for specifically the Indian markets and to compete with the Chinese phones. The M21 is priced just right!
Battery is good, more than decent camera (one cannot expect Iphone or Oneplus quality!) and solid build. This was a gift to my mother and i know she feels very comfortable using the same.

I was looking for a Made in India smartphone from a non-Chinese brand and shortlisted Samsung. Initially I was skeptical about the performance of their Exynos processors but after using the phone I can say that they are as good as (if not better than) competitors.
M21's build quality &amp; performance is pretty impressive. 6000mAH battery easily lasts for 2 days even after heavy usage. Android 10, sAMOLED display and fast charging are some of my favourite features.
In my opinion, it is the best smartphone in ‚Çπ15K budget.

What i liked about this phone is amazing battery life, charged once in last two days. I am on the call for almost 6-8 hrs due to nature of the work every day.

I am new to Samsung, shifted from MI to Samsung.

48 MP / 6000 mah / 6GB /128GB are the main reason I purchased this phone &amp; is very happy about the same.

Thanks for the smart configuration &amp; pricing the same just below 15 K mark

For the price, the screen is fabulous and honestly because that‚Äôs what you see most of the time so it‚Äôs the most important thing for me. Specs are good enough unless you want to have a competition on benchmarks. Speaker is a little tiny, but perfectly usable. Wasn‚Äôt interested in Knox or Samsung Pay (would have been NFC anyways like A51, which isn‚Äôt too useful anyways). All is all, doesn‚Äôt get sweeter than this, until the Exynks 980 midrangers hit the mkt. UI is fairly optimised and yes, No Ads like on the El Cheapo Chinese UI‚Äôs.

Samsung UI is not bad at all and ticks all the right boxes for Display, Processing, Battery. Not a flag ship or close to it.  But probably the best budget/mid tier mobile at the moment.
Nokia and Motorola were my favorites last 2 years in this segment; but Samsung wins this hands down!

Specs are good enough unless you want to have a competition on benchmarks. Speaker is a little tiny, but perfectly usable. Wasn‚Äôt interested in Knox or Samsung Pay (would have been NFC anyways like A51, which isn‚Äôt too useful anyways). All is all, doesn‚Äôt get sweeter than this, until the Exynks 980 midrangers hit the mkt. UI is fairly optimised and yes, No Ads like on the El Cheapo Chinese UI‚Äôs.

Samsung UI is not bad at all and ticks all the right boxes for Display, Processing, Battery. Not a flag ship or close to it.  But probably the best budget/mid tier mobile at the moment.
Nokia and Motorola were my favorites last 2 years in this segment; but Samsung wins this hands down!

Super AMOLED display is very fluid..and I am loving it..processor is very fast for this price point..Finger print sensor is fast but there was a little lag when your finger got wet., face unblock to open the screen very quickly...battery  life is extraordinary,.I played music,videos,surfing net,playing games,and snapping photos for 5 hrs average in a day..I got 2 full days in a single charge..In the 15W charger,the phone fully charged in 2hrs 10 mins..this is very good response for the massive 6000 mAh battery..camera quality is too good for this 13,000 price range.steadyshot videos,and 48 MP photos are nice.night mode is superb..AR emoji is fun..you can use emoji in all chats .. 20MP selfie camera is very good..edge detection during LIVE FOCUS mode is very sharp..totally  this phone is worth for your money..

I was looking for a Made in India smartphone from a non-Chinese brand and shortlisted Samsung. Initially I was skeptical about the performance of their Exynos processors but after using the phone I can say that they are as good as (if not better than) competitors.
M21's build quality &amp; performance is pretty impressive. 6000mAH battery easily lasts for 2 days even after heavy usage. Android 10, sAMOLED display and fast charging are some of my favourite features.
In my opinion, it is the best smartphone in ‚Çπ15K budget.
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars

What i liked about this phone is amazing battery life, charged once in last two days. I am on the call for almost 6-8 hrs due to nature of the work every day.

I am new to Samsung, shifted from MI to Samsung.

48 MP / 6000 mah / 6GB /128GB are the main reason I purchased this phone &amp; is very happy about the same.

Thanks for the smart configuration &amp; pricing the same just below 15 K mark

For the price, the screen is fabulous and honestly because that‚Äôs what you see most of the time so it‚Äôs the most important thing for me. Specs are good enough unless you want to have a competition on benchmarks. Speaker is a little tiny, but perfectly usable. Wasn‚Äôt interested in Knox or Samsung Pay (would have been NFC anyways like A51, which isn‚Äôt too useful anyways). All is all, doesn‚Äôt get sweeter than this, until the Exynks 980 midrangers hit the mkt. UI is fairly optimised and yes, No Ads like on the El Cheapo Chinese UI‚Äôs.

Nokia and Motorola were my favorites last 2 years in this segment; but Samsung wins this hands down!

Super AMOLED display is very fluid..and I am loving it..processor is very fast for this price point..Finger print sensor is fast but there was a little lag when your finger got wet., face unblock to open the screen very quickly...battery  life is extraordinary,.I played music,videos,surfing net,playing games,and snapping photos for 5 hrs average in a day..I got 2 full days in a single charge..In the 15W charger,the phone fully charged in 2hrs 10 mins..this is very good response for the massive 6000 mAh battery..camera quality is too good for this 13,000 price range.steadyshot videos,and 48 MP photos are nice.night mode is superb..AR emoji is fun..you can use emoji in all chats .. 20MP selfie camera is very good..edge detection during LIVE FOCUS mode is very sharp..totally  this phone is worth for your money..

A good smartphone in this price segment just go for it..
Display quality is 5star.
Battery backup is so good.gives about 10-12 hours of screen on time which is far better than other competition.
Cameras done a good job.
One UI is better than others haven't seen any ads at all...

This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Good:

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
- Received next day by 11 AM !

Not So Good:

- Not that thin, but ok.
- Doesn't have Samsung Dex
- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.
- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)
- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.

Feedback

- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.
- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.

Go for it without any doubt.

Dear Amazon &amp; samsung you have broke my trust, Lot of noise in images while capturing photos in low light.
Rear Camera getting blur in low light.
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars

Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.
Cons:
1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.

2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.

3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day "return" policy to 10 day "replacement" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.

Pros:
1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.

2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.

3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.

64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.

Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.

Face unlock very slow.

Heat issue which charging and heavy usage

Full charge takes more than 3 hrs

Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone
go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality

Also processor is not Upton the mark it's some time slow and hang in multi function use . While using keyboard , keyboard hide automatically for 1 second . My mobile variant is 6 GB 128 GB. Don't waste your time and money .

The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.

Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.

However my only concern is "dust" and how it came there if its brand new.
So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.

Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.

1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play &amp; Lenovo K8 Note.
2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.
3. PROS.
(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek &amp; stylish to look at.
(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.
(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.
(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.
(e) With quad camera &amp; a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.
(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.
(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.
4. CONS.
(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.
(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.
5. I'm satisfied with the phone &amp; the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  &amp; brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. üëç

I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product. Amazon has agreed post diagnosis saying its a faulty piece  but does not give refund

Hi
I am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.
Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.

1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.
2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.
3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.
4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.
5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.
6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.
I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.

Thanks.

I purchased this phone by seeing 64 MP for camera usage but M31 was the worst phone with camera quality.. Front camera is 8 and back camera was 16 MP not more that that.. there is no return option only replacement(Good game was playing by samsung &amp;Amazon) please dont buy this mobile and dont waste your money... Heating problem while charging.. etc  i am really  very frustrated with this phone quality.. i lost my money by buying this phone..üòîüòîüò™

Not satisfied with the quality
Display quality is no adequate
Body is made of plastic like material
I was using MI like 6 plus pro then 7 plus pro
For a change I have purchased this product, the quality is not up to the mark when comparing to my old redmi note series
I have requested for refund but as Amazon policy they refused for refund
Not value for money

Cons:
Button position (power&amp; volume) too high
Fingerprint reader too high
Heats up a lot.
Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.
A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.
A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours &amp; 28 minutes
Speaker volume low.
The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.

Pros:
Feels lightweight
Nice display.
The camera is decent.

Update 1:
Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.

Update 2:
Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.

Update 3:
Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit.

One of worst mobile and one of the worst brand. Better to purchase any other brand except Samsung.
1. Heating issue
2. Second sim works on 3g.
3. Even its 6Gb ram works like 2gb ram phone.

When I called amazon customer care they said I have to go to service center for this and they are telling to check through app.

Its a f***ing phone please please please don't waste your money.

And this is my last ever purchase from amazon.

1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around.
2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point.
3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network.
 wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone.
bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance.

I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day.  Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting  sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes.
 I expect this might be  software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.
Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me.

Lot of heating issues, Picture quality is dam bad, Battery not at all look like 6000 MAH, it is hardly 3000 MAH. Taking 4 hrs to full charge and draining like any thing. No match to the technology from Chinese Products like OPPO,LENOVO and Realme. Way behind compared to chinese products. Humble request to all, not to buy this product...

I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!
I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!
I so miss my POCO

First the pros
1. The brand name - if you think it is one!
2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant
3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos
4. Build - seems decent

Cons:
1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying
2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today
3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable üò≠. What kinda innovation is this
4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app tooüò¨. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device
5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device
6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic
7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emailsüò≠. Believe me, I have tried all settings
8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps üòÇü§£. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking
9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.

The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates me

Anyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me now

What a waste of Money this has been

Over am not that super satisfied..
Pros
# Good LiveFocus camera, Shallow DoF is excellent
# sAmoled Display is great
# Good features

Cons
# Slow-motion video sucks goes dark
# Macro lens has lot of distortion
# Charging sucks needs 2.5hrs to get full charge, 6000mah is good but discharges 1.5day for normal usage.
# Slight heat while charging..
# 9 out of 10 times doesn't recognise your face during low light, figer print reader is also slippary
# Poor mobile &amp; Wifi Signal scanning
# Phone is slippary in hand use protective case always.

Over all I didn't get the feel I expected for this price range..

Received it on time within 24 hours thumps up to amazon. Now Product. Done all the settings. I am using samsung after a long gap of 8-10 years. After Samsung Grand I had stopped using. So setting done now data transfer Samsung's smart switch option is fantastic. Everything I wanted to transfer got it. No problem at all .Now SIM transferred. Done OK it is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card. Effortless working.
Now Camera. It has got lot of options. All I have not yet tried but for sure I have checked the quality of the photograph and the night mode is superb. What else you want to know rest of the things are written in detail and is true. Working very fine. Proud to won it. Nice Product. Samsung should keep competing iPhone

Cons:
1. RAM. Claims to be 6GB, whereas my 2year old phone with 4GB RAM has much smoother display
2. Battery Charging. Claims 15W fast charging. Takes more than 2 hours to charge the phone.

Pros:
1. Good cameras
2. Perfect screen size

I bought it as a great deal from Samsung, but it is a BIG dissappointment. And they say it cannot be returned. Total waste of money for me. Redmi Note pro 8 is much better than this at same price.

Display quality is good. But one thing which I don't like about the camera is that we can't use flash light when we take shots with 64 MP lens. Low light photographs are also not upto the mark. Rest everything is fine.

Corning gorella glass 3 is ok we can use tempered protection.
Even 3 hr charging time is ok we can charge during night.
But Overheating how can we deal with them !
this price range other companies providing super fast , cool processor like snapdragon 730G.

It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display &amp; mammoth battery.
Pros :
1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )
2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.
3. SAR rating - lowest one
4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )

Cons :
1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print &amp; dust magnet )
2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great
3. Not so great processor

Who can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming &amp; not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery &amp; Samsung branding.

I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.

Pros:
1. Display: Trust me it‚Äôs amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.
2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.
3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.

Cons:
1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.
2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.
3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.
4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn‚Äôt work even after adding alternate looks.

Verdict: You can buy this if you don‚Äôt like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.

Amazon.india  just destroyed their Goodwill by selling this product.
I purchased this phone for my friend. And now he is angry on me....

6. Camera is not that great as expected with 64mp.

Pros:

Very poor performance.. camera is ok not bad . But very slow net speed .. opening app time is relatively fast but after internet is very slow .... my old mobile Samsung on max is much faster performance for loading web page than Samsung m31 .. this phone taking much more time to open any web site ... remaining everything is ok ..
Fast changing is not far like they said .. 30 mins charging it charging 20% but my old Samsung is 30% charged at same time . I have found this two major drawback.

Very bad mobile. Heating and hanging problem. Amazon not refunding even having mobile problem. Don't buy this mobile. Go for Redmi mobile. Camera  quality is  worst. Many thing's not  supported. Anyone want to take this mobile please let me know. Reduce some amount. Buy before 7 days. Only  battery is good other is worst. Samsung  must quit in making mobile.

Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ‚Çπ59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.
------------------------------------------------------
Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.
Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.

I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and cons
Pros:
1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.
2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)
3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAM
Cons:
1. Front Camera is not as good as expected
2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ‚≠êÔ∏è)
3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex

I was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this.

Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara.

During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendly

The most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......

Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.

Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme.. I trusted Samsung  but eventually  it didn't  fulfilled  my expectations.

First... I would like to express my experience of this mobile is tooooooo worst.... It's never performed like 6GB Ram Mobile.... It's working like 512kb ram ram mobile. And another great backdrop is it's bluetooth... It's connectivity does not meets at atleast basic phone... And another thing is it's speaker...This one also very poor.... Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst...
I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms.
Finally, my dear all who want to buy this product i strongly recommend that don't buy this mobile and don't waste your money...

Camara is too bad. Sound clarity is not at all good ... though it looks like a premium phone ,but when you started using it makes you feel that you bought a cheap quality product. Gets frequently stuck and restarts for no reason.

The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screen
If you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colors
I am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few days
Camera pictures are good
Lots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually

Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.
After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.
Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons üòú). Think before buying this phone.

Apart from battrey and screen nothing is good. Front facing camera as per specs is of 32mp. But when u go for high resolution it show 21MP... TOTALLY CRAP. My samsung j7's 8mp is FAR MORE BETTER THAN this one in terms of front camera. FRAUD BY SAMSUNG.
Finger prnt reader is not able to detect most of the times.

Disappointed  with Samsung, after many year I decided  to back to Samsung but  truly disappointed. Worst part of Amazon policy now you can't return at alll moreover not even replace easily,  you need to install the app then you will surprise  all the problems you face shall be found ok in the software. You will be in difficult to face the situation. My strong recommendation not to go with Samsung M31.

A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.

Camera is not as expected. Its garunteed not 64MP the way it takes pictures. Ofcourse the colors in the pictures are awesome however, if we try to zoom even slightly it doesnt show clearly. Night mode is also not as expected it gives blurr images. I am disappointed with the camera as camera was the sole reason I took this phone. Front camera is as usual with full of beauty effects which I hate. Otherwise, speaking about its other features such as battery, looks and feel, Display, etc it is pretty well with this price. Although the plastic feels kinda cheap but its ok.

hi,
I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm.
On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good.

Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall.

However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.

Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.
1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc
2. LED flash for incoming calls
3. Reminders &amp; Goals missing in Calendar
4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc
5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting. Seems like it needs high lighting

1.Camera - 3.8/5
2.Performance - 3.0/5
3.Battery backup - 2.7/5
(Battery doesnot prove itself as 6000mah)
Charge time is quiq agreed.But,drains fast.Feels like the capacity is 4000mah.
My reivew im submitting after a week of observed usage.
My major point on selecting this mobile was battery.........They assured 6000mah but the fact is i can just get 4000mah worthfullness.
If ur just looking for 6000mah battery mobile this is the worst choice.
Badly feel like cheated by samsung.

Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels).
Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones.
Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardware

Finally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands.
Infact my first samsung phone.
While configuration, received security patch and UI updates
From user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands.
Since the frameless case in yet to be delivered, using it very carefully
Super happy user since 3days. No complaints or regret on buying the phone.

Samsung M31 is the best ever mobile I found till now with "6000 mAh" monster battery, superb "64 MP Quad Camera", sAMOLED Amazing display, 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM, very quick fingerprint reader and many more. I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents or videos as we required. As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.

I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.
My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.
The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.
Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.
So here are the pros and cons
PROS:
- Price
- Camera
- Battery
- Display
- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.

CONS:
- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.
- Charging could be faster

Final thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.

Review after 2 days of use
Screen - 2 good..animations and transition very good, I won't miss hype around 90hz refresh rate
Samsung OS- one UI 2.0 is good but I personally don't like the home screen, using Lawnchair launcher for home screen and dock...Like other features of OneUI2.0
Games- Cant say, I dont use mobile for gaming
Battery- charged only once til now, so far so good
Camera- Love live focus by samsung..Boehner is applied to all faces in pic, daylight pics and Videos are awesome, yet to test night mode
Camera after 10days- indoor and low light is below average and a let down by Samsung.
This is my first Samsung Smartphone and I am glad I bought it

Opinion after 10 days- reducing rating to 3stars

Worst battery..its takes 2.5-3 hours to fully charge may be 3.3 hours. Battery life okay. offen hands while scrolling WhatsApp of Instagram. Screen gets black out every day for 5- 10 seconds.
Camera is good.
M series in total not good..earlier bought m20 got sick in 12 days company says not replacement , service service also repaired  but it got hanging problem again now m20 is in useless.

(After 2 months usage)
The only advantage is AMOLED display.

Performance of this phone is not at par.
Battery is also disappointing as far as 6000 MAH is given, it only last a whole day.
I was using 3500 mah phone earlier and that almost lasted same. Than 6000 mah should last too much longer than that, it's not optimised.

Phone also gets heated sometimes even in normal usage (no games)

Also build of the quality is not as standard for this range. It looks ok but actually cheap. The plastics make sounds when you feel it by fingers.
Many scratches at back after 2 months usage.
Material is just not very good.

I did not find it fast enough for 6 GB RAM.
Processor is slow. CALL DIALING, and normal features also run slow on this phone.
Camera is also not very good.

To sum it up, camera, battery ,performance is not up to standards and disappointing and only good id amoled display.

Poor camera and display quality. Its not a 64 MP camera it's  quality is like 8 MP camera. Flash is not working in 64 MP ratio.And Amazon is also not returning this item. Vivo gives more quality in this price range. Now a days Samsung is selling it's name only not quality. Don't buy this.

Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products

Good phone.
It's an a nice device.
Well designed OS with Android 10. With Ui2.
Nice and good popup notification.as well as access this popup directly as a second screen.

Good cameras. Four cameras including of 64Mega pixels. Giving amazing performance.
Amoled display giveing different view for all applications as well as photos.
Cameras giving high quality of the photos with as on view . No more high make over.

Connecting with other made very easy with in one or two steps. Like WIFI, TV,and other device's.
Awesome battery. Proofing Mega monster.
Awesome storage also a mega monster.

Well improved security level, face detection.
Notification also customised as different level.
New type of notification sounds are good.

From the date of purchasing till iam not faced any hanging and heating problem.

Compass aquricy also well and good.

I feel only one disadvantage is remote sensor.
The remote sensor not in this mobile. I know before purchasing also.

I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.

Pros:
------
&gt;&gt; no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.
&gt;&gt; Good battery backup
&gt;&gt; Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.

Cons:
------
&gt;&gt; Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.
&gt;&gt; we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.
&gt;&gt; This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.
&gt;&gt; This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).
&gt;&gt; Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!
&gt;&gt; The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.
&gt;&gt; This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.
&gt;&gt; The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.
&gt;&gt; My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.

Conclusion:
-------------
An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.

I bought this phone as soon as it was launched, a month ago after my Galaxy S10 was stolen. I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.
What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.
So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.

The phone is very amazing it's more than expectation. I ordered black version with 6GB of ram and 128 GB space. Best smartphone in this segment price. The trump card  of this phone is camera. What a wide angle and selfie  captured by this phone amazingly good..  all the best feature you will get on this price.

Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.

This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:

First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.

Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.

Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.

If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?

Purchased Samsung M31 on sale date and got delivered the very next day. As soon as i opened  the box i was disappointed  as there is no Screen protector or Mobile case available. Box has only mobile phone , type c cable and charger only. Phone was charged to 73%.
Now , i have been using it for past few days and i have mixed reviews about it.Display of this phone is very good and one can easily differentiate between anyother company and samung's super Amoled.Camera seems to be okayish.. it's  not that great but UI of samsung is very smooth.Batterylife is also decent compared to 6000mah.
My opinion is it will be a decent buy for 15k but dont expect too much from it.

It's really amazing product...smooth operations...huge battery backup...premium look....feel is superb..... (first 5 days)

But
Camera quality expectations are fully embarasing. Camera wise it makes mood off.

I waited for this handset, purchased after long wait....performance is superb..but quality of camera is so so....

One more problem noticed-
Hangs too much,
Can't shut off,can't reboot,
Voice calling hanged,
No voice during calls, just mute..
Slowwwwww,
It shows UI error..

Totally disappointed...

Requested for refund/replace...waiting for good one.

Charging of the phone is really slow it takes 3 hours to full charge.. samsung cheated us.

Fair review after one week of usage:
Pros: 1. The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.
2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.
3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.
4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.
5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.
6. Battery life is quite very good.
7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.
8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.
9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.
Cons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn‚Äôt expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.
2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.
3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.
4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.
5. The charging is a bit slow.
6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn‚Äôt expected with this processor and android version.
7. The sound output could have been more.
8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.
9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.
The phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage. Though its the best phone in all the lower range series of samsung.

There are lots of negative review which led me to confusion before buying this, but this phone is worth the price.
Display- awesome, colors , touch rsponse...all good.
Battery- long backup, even if u play games. Around 14 hrs display time (medium usage)
Charging - a bit slow, takes 2 hrs from 25 to 100
Camera- good color production,  decent picture quality (not a sony sensor, so don't expect that quality), macro is nice. Selfie (both angle) decent. Overall for day to day usage it's very good. But not for pro shooters.
Processor- thought it would be the biggest drawback, but it is not, pubg and asphault runs well in smooth(not hdr)

Overall i will recommend this phone to all who use phone for day to day usage(no hardcore gaming but big games with casual setting will run well), love to support made in india products.
Thank you.

I feel cheated. This phone sucks. Battery lasts less than my 4000 mah battery. The "64mp" camera shows more blurriness and pixels than my redmi note 7 pro which has 48mp camera.

The phone's screen also looks kinda cheap although performs well, the build quality of the device is far bellow standards. Extremely disappointed. Beware. This phone has many PAID reviews that speak highly about this device.

I don't know this issue for all M31 devices or only my device. Camera quality is very very very bad.. If you do little zoom, you can see black lines are coming and going..If you record video, more than 30 minutes..getting message "camera not responding message"...Not happy with the audio

Battery is great which lasts for a day.
Display is nice and Bigger great for watching video and playing games.
Fingerprint scanner is little bit slow.
Face detection also slow.
But in 16 k it is value for money.

Weak signal antenna...Flash and wide angle camera don't work with 64MP camera..battery performance don't look like 6000mh. Both front and rear camera quality is bad...making false advertisement on camera and battery performance...don't think you are getting quality features in Rs.16000..if you buy it you are big fool..

1. Camera is not up to the expectation
2. Battery doesn't seem to be 6000 Mah it hardly last 1 day further takes 2.5 to 3 hrs to get fully charged worried if this is huge battery life and fast charging, what will be the normal one from Samsung.

Hope the company have test check the features, if not kindly do it to get the correct facts.

Other brands which are way smaller than the samsung brand offer better performance.

Very poor quality, phone touch stopped responding on few areas suddenly. Didn't expected this from Samsung. I am not able to use from a month.. :(
Tried connecting customer service and they asked to go service center when it opens after lockdown. On asking whether my warranty period would be extended due to this, they completely denied.. I am feeling cheated now. :((
Don't buy this phone !!

Camera(VIDEO STABILIZATION dosent work) , battery are good . Phone heats up a little bit but that heating is acceptable .

Screen is not as good as Nokia screens and others (IPS LCD ) , IPS LCD would have given a better performance .

Screen doesn't give Natural colours.

Performance is good . Fingerprint sensor is awsome , it works very Smoothly .

The software has better options .

Mirror link is not supported by this mobile . If they had provided Mirror screen option then it would have been great ,no 3rd party app supports mirror link .

Charging cable is too short .

Camera is not as good as Nokia 8.1 ,6 .

If the mobile gets IPS LCD SCREEN , SONY IMX CAMERA then the mobile would be so awesome

I was using Samsung J2 earlier,  excellent phone,  later shifted to moto X4....after long time switching again to Samsung after hearing the success of M30s. Little disappointed. It's an average mobile phone.
1.The finish of the phone is below average. If we use this mobile without back cover,  please will judge that this guy is using cheap Mobile,  I am covering it up with spigen cover now. It is not even like Samsung J2 mobile. Poor plastic.(ABS).
2. CAMERA,  I use to take lot of mobile photographs  it's my hobby,  I don't see any difference in this megapixel and 3 or 4 camera's....if you are better cameraman, single camera is enough,  since it is with 4 camera we try to take different pictures,  camera okay. Lot of night in low light. Macro is 5 MP, no clear picture....
3. Reception of Mobil signal, I felt slightly weak,  when I compare with motoX4, I was using it for nearly 2 years, now with M31s, I am not getting proper data connectivity inside home. Further I have to check...
4. Mobile phone is mobile slightly heating up, not like mi,  but it is not like earlier Samsung.
5. Battery it mega but last for one complete day, there is ko need to search charger in the evening,  but we need to charge it in the night, the charging time is long since the battery 6000mah. There will be possibilities of partial charging of battery, which may reduce the life of battery.
Samsung could have done better, looks like urgently cooked...
Can we replace with M30s?...

Received my Samsung Galaxy M31 on 7th Mar. It cost me 15,999 rupees.

Literally shocked to see the Indian sim card only labeled on box.

Immediately called Amazon customer and their response is pathetic. They said they cannot write everything about product.

Product description is based on what features they want to show to customer. As it is a electronic item so there is no return possible, only replacement option is available if there is any fault in the product and cannot do anything more.

They are not ready to accept the fact that they are hiding such a important information that this phone cannot be used outside India.

Learnt my lesson and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in future.

They are only good enough for groceries and small items.

Awesome  screen .
Awesome battery  .
Awesome  cameras .
Specially  ... one UI 2.0 of Samsung  is superb. I used Samsung  Galaxy  alot but for 2-3yrs i was on moto and others ... but being  back to Samsung ... it's  worth it .

Go for it ... the screen is just min blowing  at this price . No one can beat it .

Also .. I don't  play any games ... but i read alot and watch plenty of movies ...but being  an experienced  smartphone  user i can tell ... it can run any game without  lag .. with 6 gb + exynos 9611 processors (if I'm  ri8) . Same as A51 which cost 24k .

Just go for it .

1 thing is plastic body ... but body is also very good ... not like previous  plastic  Samsung  ... it's  glossy ... but any way we are gonna use back case  ... so it doesn't matter  anyway .

1 thing - Biometric  take some time to get use to i guess.

It's  a large device ... side fingerprint  would have been best .
And face unlock  take some time ..... face unlock is not that good i would say . But may be due to extra security  .. we have to make sure of correct  angle and light  .

Pros:
1. Display is good especially dark images or videos look great
2. Really a monstrous battery
3. Selfie camera is better
4. Fingerprint sensor is fast
5. OS is fluidic without any lag
6. Call quality and reception is good
7. No ads and the default Apps can be deleted

Neutral:
1. External speaker volume is decent but not great. Would be great if they provide stereo speakers like in the Nokias

Cons:
1. Primary Camera is decent but not great. 64 MP is just a number on paper. My 16 MP LG V20 camera takes better photos.
2. Phone is little heavy

Conclusion:
If you don't want Redmi Note series phones then this is the best branded alternative at this price point

Sorry but this time Amazon and Samsung really disappointed me.
I have bought samsung m30 and m30 S earlier from Amazon and it was really a Goood great deal. But this time it was very disappointing and shameful. I bought m31 megamonster for my soulmate but she really got disappointed with phone and it was really hurting for me.

Poor camera quality like a 2 megapixel camera
Not 64mp
Poor battery like 3500mAh not 6000mAh

DON'T BUY M31 U CAN GO FOR M30S. SORRY SAMSUNG

Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.

*Camera:

Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.
Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.

* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.

* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:
--&gt; Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)
--&gt; 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming
--&gt; 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)
Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.

* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.

* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.

* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.

* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).

* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...
--&gt; Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)
--&gt; Personally love the Dark Mode.

Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.

The Amazon tamper proof packaging &amp; timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.
The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.
After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.
I like the look &amp; feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.
Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front &amp; rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.
For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).
In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.

It's an upgrade to the M30s. The screen is good with a raindrop camera. The Super Amoled display is quite good to use even while at outdoors.
The massive 6000 mah battery easily gives backup upto 1.5 days on moderate to heavy usage.
It takes around 2 hours 40 mins to 3 hours on initial charging from zero to 100 percent.
For Gamers there a Game Booster App.

The camera is also quite good with lots of options to choose from.

Cons:
The phone has some bloatwares, some from samsung, and some third party like Helo app. Some apps like fb can only be disabled.

Overall a Good Phone, and the massive 6000mah battery is really good for moderate to heavy users.

I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!

I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.
This phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.

Now coming to the phone :

Pros :-
1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.
2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.
3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.
4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.
5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.
6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.
Other conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.

Now coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :
1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.
2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.
3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.

Overall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)

Let‚Äôs start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.

Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.

Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review

The Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.

Galaxy M31

That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.

In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.

Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review

Galaxy M31

The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.

Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.

Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review

Galaxy M31

The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.

On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company‚Äôs custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.

First time I plugged in for charging. Phone displayed recovery mode screen though I haven't pressed any button. Totally disappointed by this experience.
I have requested to return this item and refund me entire amount but amazon policy relaxed upto replacement.
Bad experience.

Display and look wise phone looks stunning but still I haven't used it so system performance might be well as expected. I hope so.

Waiting for brand new replacement of M31. I hope it would work well

Good phone in mid range. Though the plastic back takes away the premium feel of using samsung brand. Function wise it's good. But looks wise the company could do better using glass or metal.

Fingerprint reader is accurate and so is face recognition.

Battery is powerful and long lasting. Keeps you going all day!

Camera quality is awesome and comes with many cool features also! Pictures and videos are sharp and true to their color and high quality.

Overall, it comes with many features and the brand Samsung adds to the value and trustworthiness of this phone!! Using it for three months now. Smooth and perfect.

PA: no proper cover available. I wish samsung provided it.even if for extra cost with high quality for protection.

Couldn't find any till date. Help me if someone has recommendations.:(

I can't believe within a month the phone screen started showing lines.

19/05/2020 May Update: Went to the service center in Delhi and the lady and the manager said I'd need to pay if anything is broken. What's the warranty for? I asked what's the "Gorilla Glass" for if it couldn't handle a pocket fall (which is what they said happened)? And their reply, "We are insiders. So we understand these things, there's no such thing as "gorilla vorilla" it's a normal mirror. If it falls and breaks then you'll have to pay for this."

I can't believe Samsung has been making a fool of us all these years. Can anyone else confirm this "insider" info? Meanwhile, the rest of you should keep this in a bank locker.

Wonderful phone for this budget. People talk about lot of specs in the phones like xiaomi  and poco in this price range. But Samsung has all that and longevity as well. Samsung phones don't die on you.
The camera setup on this phone is wonderful, the detailing it captures, the colors, the selfies  every thing is perfect.
The huge 6000mah battery, just wow. It will easily last for 2 days if not more. Even with high youtubeing and social networking it will last for 2 days.
Signal receiving strength is excellent and to add to that it has wifi-calling option as well.
Speakers are good, but real deal is listening the music through head phones, it supports Dolby atmos.
The rear mounted finger print sensor is at the right place and super fast.
The 6.4 inch AMOLED screen is next level. Its Samsung so you can't expect nothing less.
With 6 GB RAM the multi tasking is really good.
Overall wonderful phone with very decent pricing and its Samsung.  It can't get any better than this in this price range.
So go for it and this phone will definitely surprise you.

After using one week i have these experience with Samsung Galaxy M31.
Pros: Attractive design.
Screen size is handy at 6.4 inch.
Good camera,both selfie and main at 32mp and 64 mp.
Cons:
Phone is heating very much.It heats always when charging,gaming and using internet.
Charging is very slow.
Even it is having 6000 mah battery, it drains very fast.
In standby position also it comes from 100% to 80% overnight.
Very disappointing.If this is fixed after any updates I will update my review.
After two weeks of usage I am updating.
After writing to Samsung members they suggested me some changes in settings.Now my mobile performing well.

1. The camera is up to the mark. No one Compete Samsung in mid Range Phone as Samsung has very powerful camera Software.
2.It looks stunning high-end category.
3.The battery is very powerful.
4. Fast charging.
5. Got OS update yesterday- Feb Security Patch included.

Cons:
1. Must be given some back cover in the Box.
2. No headset included in the box.
3. Earphone slot is given at a downside which makes it difficult to handle the phone.

It's been only a few days of purchase.  So far the experience is good. My usage is minimal for basic emails, social media chats, picture sharing etc. Very less usage for voice/video calls as well. No gaming. Battery seems to last three days easily on one full charge.
What makes me proud to own this device is that in all the years I have owned a cell phone, this is the first time I am holding a "Made in India" device. Proud of that . Will post an update later based on future experience

I am a tech guy and this review is genuine. First of all Samsung is the baap of mobiles..coming to m31 I waited so long to buy and saw many reviews.lets start from positive..
1. Camera is awesome both front and back. Picture clarity in zoom is good
2. Very smooth finish of mobile which looks really great
3. Touch is better than other mobiles compared to Oppo or MI
Coming to negative points
all reviews almost fake regarding battery...they just really bluffed..6000 mah battery is not even coming for 2 full days..I used data for around 18 hrs but still it got drained fast.
When charged the mobile it taking around 4 hrs to get complete charge from 0 to 100 percentage  but mobile is getting heated a lot..didn't expect this from Samsung at all.
Loud speaker is not so efficient.
Normal sound is good
As its SAMOLED the picture or video quality is good..eyes r not strained

I purchased this mobile based on previous Samsung galaxy mobile experience. Now i've mixed feelings on it.

These are my observations after single day use.

1. Rear camera quality is extraordinary unless you zoom it.
2. Front camera isn't that great. Beauty mode is always on and photos are patchy.
3. Samsung KNOX isn't preinstalled. So, you can't use "Secure Folder". Need to install "S Secure" app for app lock.
4. Guesture screenshot didn't work.
5. Phone is slightly heated while updating and installing apps.
6. OS is so smooth.
7. Fingerprint reader unlocks the mobile swiftly.

Update: after multiple days of regular use
1. So far battery lasts almost 2 days with regular usage. Like YouTube, Facebook and etc.,
2. Though it's of 6GB ram, I noticed lag and phone stuck frequently.
3. Front cam needs a lot of improvement
4. Call quality isn't that great
5. You can hear full voice only when tye voulme is completely up or almost full. Same applies to earphones as well.

Verdict: Go with this mobile if you're expecting a good rear camera and better battery performance.

I have been purchasing Samsung M series phones for self and family for years now and never regretted my choices. The M30s for my FiL and this lovely M31 for myself are both excellent phones at a very very competitive price. With the lastest Android 10 OS and access to both Google and Galaxy playstores, an incredible Amoled screen with excellent touch sensitivity etc., this is a beautiful choice. With a monster battery, even without aggressive conservation settings, you get good milage. The new USB connector is a joy, with the option of high power charging for those urgencies when traveling.. backed by Amazon's super logistics and accessories options, this is a great buy!

Received the phone 20 days back. After a long gap I am back to Samsung Brand and I must say the phone is awesome almost in all departments. The performance of 6GB/128 GB handset is definitely above the mark, ergonomically designed phone fits into the palm well , hence its a pleasure to hold the phone. The camera quality is good, ease of using, navigation is extremely user friendly and the  finger print sensor is good, not yet explored face recognition feature. Most of the important apps are pre-installed hence its again a plus point and more importantly Microsoft tools are re pre-installed, Just one draw back which I  found in the phone as of now is the app lock facility is not available need to install a separate app from the play store, this should have given as a preinstalled feature.My verdict is go for the phone its an awesome piece not from china so that's another satisfaction of holding this handset.

Good things are
1.Awesome cameras, both front and rear (a shot using macro mode is attached)
2.Excellent processing speed
3.Battery withstands more than 30 hours ( all time mobile data enabled, camera was used many times, normal WhatsApp usage but I never play video games).
4. Wonderful display experience (far better than my previous (Galaxy on next)
5. Low SAR value (0.38 W/kg as per manual) and No heating issues during the above mentioned usage.
6. Highly comfortable UI to use the phone
7. Face recognition is good (can't find fault)
8. All the features are really good and high end configuration under Rs. 15000
9. I feel Very comfortable to have this phone and it is really worthy

Improvements required are
1. Call volume is little less and loud speaker volume also littleless (I don't have any hearing issues)
2. It takes more than a hour to fully charge But it may be acceptable because of 6000 mAh Battery.
3. Samsung should have sold this good phone with headphone. So, without headphone I feel this sale is incomplete

It is a best budget phone with the amount of provided specs in it, having a massive battery of 6000mah gave me a decent backup of upto 2 days, if you are a average user then this is a phone you want, I played all types of games in it from ludo to asphalt 9 and pubg but it stood up to its name as not much of battery drain but minute lags were observed at the start but later on after few second everything got ok, adaptive brightness is very good but was not working some times had to manually set it but sometimes switching it off and on came as a solution, fingerprint sensor is quick but some times doesn't works if it is a bit dusty, also if you hands are wet it will take multiple attempts before giving access, most of the reviews I read about back panel color and material quality was negative as compared with other phones but personally i liked the color of back panel as I have the ocean blue you can call me old fashioned but there are many reasons like 1. It looks good,  2. Doesn't slips from you hand 3. Eventually you are going to use a back cover with it and etc, I have a transparent back cover over mine coz no other color would be that good as it's original, its display is one of the best as the picture quality and the color contrast and many other aspects cannot be compared with other phones in market, it also provided built in Dolby atmos when using earphone which totally changes the experience of audio while watching movies or listening songs its is just amazing, I was averagely satisfied with the camera as the night mode is not that good when compared with other phones, macro shots are very good but struggles a bit to focus, I did not find any much difference between slow mo and ultra slow mo, providing inbuilt custom stickers and emoji are good and enjoyable, speaker volume are good for a average noisy room conditions but not for listening songs outdoors, there are many gestures which takes time to get comfortable with but once you are life gets easier also there are many other features which proved helpful for day to day working environment, over all it is a best phone for average and heavy usage until and unless you are planning to play heavy games on it entire day long with heavy graphics requirement
Thank you üòÅ

My review after using the phone after 8 days of continuous use as I have ordered it on the day of launch 5th March.

Pros:
1. The battery is humongous. it's 6000 Mah. It will last for at least 2 days for normal use. For extensive use like 12 hrs of video stream then it will last at least 24-30 hours.

2. Exynos 9611 processor comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.

3. It comes with Android 10.0 which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.

4. The camera can capture 4K videos too and the camera quality is really  very good both rear as well as front.

5. It has an impressive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with minimal bezels.

6. It has polycarbonate back which isn‚Äôt as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.

7. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).

8. With 6 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far. 128 GB storage is quite enough.

9. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).

10. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.

Cons:-

1. Night mode isn‚Äôt the best.

2. It supports a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M31 is decent but not rich enough.

3. It doesn't come with earphones.

4. It comes with a 15W type-c charger. It goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours. As per same price rahge competitors they could have given at least 25W or so.

Conclusion:-
If you are looking for a phone with best battery backup, good camera quality, best SAmoled display available in price range and a decent processor to handle day to day use with Samsung brand value.

Regards,
Yash

sir, I  purchased the mobile with much excitement that it would provide a wonderful experience but actually the product is not worth purchasing. After using the phone for 3 to 4 weeks the system asked for an update of the software but as soon as I downloaded the update and installed it. My mobile crashed and I can do nothing on the phone. It is neither getting switched off nor restarted. So what type of help you can provide me in this regard. I will be waiting for your reply as a customer.

Best smartphone in this budget.
It has 4 rear camera with 64 mp main features.
Selfies had good impressions due to 32 mp front camera. No need to press buttons for selfy.
Very smooth display.
Sound quality ok.
But in headphones very good quality.
Only one issue is NFC connectivity is not available.
Rest every thing super.

It's really good device. Battery is a freaking beast, amoled display is beautiful and UI is very slick and simple. I got nothing to complaint considering what I paid for it. I would never buy crappy Xiaomi phones with its obscene notifications. Go for samsung phones, they don't push anything vulgar with their phones.

I brought this phone because of camera and battery. Battery is fine but i expected more from camera the details of camera is poor when you zoom the image even 4x digital and optical. Recently i broughted m30s 2 weeks ago and it has some issues so i returned it and i am telling you there is no major upgrade on rare 64mp camera mode. It's almost look like m30s 48mp photos. I watched many youtubers saying this is the best camera with this price but i think it needs importants because when i zoom in after taking a image its details are gone its look like 2mp image. But i think Samsung can fix this problem with software upgrade and overall this phone is good and also I don't know why they bother giving a macro camera , it's pathetic it's can't get too close and the details are pathetic link 0.5 mp . And if samsung fix this issue with update i will update my review.

The WORST phone you can get in this range, front camera pics quality is so worst that it looks like an oil paint job with all smudged, NO SHARPNESS at all. The curve of display is so round it doesn't even  feel like a rounded rectangle, it's an OVAL. EVERTHING IS PLASTIC, The software processing, image processing, performance processing  is just bad, no its WORST. The game booster which is provided doesn't  seems like its boosting anything than consumption of battery. A LOT OF HEAT IS GENERATED in usage of 1 hour even while doing normal tasks.
In conclusion, even if someone  is giving  this SAMSUNG M31 for free DON'T BUY IT.  M31 is just a hoax of a specs and nothing more, the worst of all. This was my first samsung phone, gone with the brand's name and it's simply disappointing,
NEVER GONNA BUY ANOTHER  SAMSUNG PRODUCT
Now with this AMAZON POLICY OF NOT REFUNDING, feels like the most regrettable decision of the year, feels like mental torture spending 17K for this M31. SIMPLY WORST. Seriously  need my money back, NEED REFUND for this product, WORST PRODUCT in every aspect.

Very good product. I read about the concerns on the camera but still decided to go ahead. The mobile is fantastic. Camera, OS everything is good. This was my first online purchase of this value and had concerns there. But was delighted as everything went smooth. There was a delivery OTP provided by Amazon hence the delivery person had to deliver to me in person which was good. I was worried that he shouldn't leave it with security in my absence. 2nd, the seller had packed it nicely, the primary pack seal by the manufacturer was intact hence a genuine new pack. Overall, had a great experience - product, delivery and the  seller.

Very bad product. There are so many issue.
1. Heating during using the phone. Like camera phone calls in 2-5 mins.
2. Poor front camera quality. Like 8 MP camera.
3. Sound is also not good.
4. Taking more than 3 hours to charge full. And 6000mah batter is giving one day backup.full fake.
Totally fake phone by Samsung. Requesting Amazon to don't sell this kind of fake phone. Samsung  are fooling the amezon customer.
Don't buy.

Battery life is better than my previous phone which was a 4000MAh. I am yet to rigorously test it through gaming and continuous wifi or data being on.

Camera on the front does a horrible job. Shame on Samsung that they name it a 32Mp camera. The back camera does a decent job but not upto the expectation of a quad camera set with 64Mp.

RAM is pretty good and I feel the phone has no lag and it doesn't hang.

Speaker voice quality is average and could be  better.

The body is extremely disappointing as it's a fingerprint magnet and Samsung doesn't give you a back cover at least.

Facial recognition takes a lot of time

Conclusion: can't expect any better than this on the price range.
However, samsung and Amazon have blown the hype out of proportion especially when they know that business value is lesser when competing with the likes of Xiaomi or Vivo or Realme

This phone is a winner. Absolutely stunning camera @64 MP. Excellent battery life, still running after extensive excitement use by my daughter. Biometric scans both face and fingerprint work well. Video quality is excellent
Awesome cost.

The only drawback Galaxy store works well, the play store doesn‚Äôt.

I purchased Samsung NEW on the very day of its launch. Got delivery next day. Actually it arrived before estimated time.
This I have been using the phone for about one week now. It's a fantastic phone.
1. Design, slimness, weight is very impressive.
2. Display sAMOLED is simply superb. Color production stunning.
3. I have purchased M30s also a few months ago. M31's display is even better than M30s.
4. Battery lasts for about 2 days on usual use time. I have Samsung On Max also. Which I have to charge twice a day. But NEW easily runs for 2 days.
5. Camera is also very good, both rear and front. I have taken some night photos without using flash. They, beautifully captured the subjects with clear details. Front camera is equally good.
6. It's lighter than M30s (which is also having 6000mah battery).
7. Phone doesn't get heated up much even on continuous use.
8. One good feature Samsung has added is caller identity. It detects spams automatically. No need to install Truecaller.
9. It also has QR Code scanner. This is very helpful.
Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price range. I am fully satisfied having purchased this phone

Brought M31 128 gb variant . Phone looks great and display really nice. But battery  life is not seems to be like 6000mah . For simple usage YouTube videos,online songs- battery drains fast  .  I was using lg w30 as temporary mobile (3000mah)I feel that mobile backup was good.

After some day will update my comments if any changes

This is a short review after the first 24 hours of the M31 6GB 128GB black color phone I have bought. I had shortlisted Redmi9 pro max and this one as my top 2 choices for a 17000 or less phone. I opted for M31 for its 6000mah battery, oled screen and great camera. I am not a high end gamer but I do create a lot of memes, videos and posts for my social media. First 24 hours, this phone rocks  (my last phone is a Moto G4 plus). No heating issues. Screen is too good. Battery after 24 hours of hectic usage is still 40% remaining. 15w charger is not ultra fast but quite decent. Overall a great purchase decision. I will replace my other MotoG5 plus with this soon. Instead of spending 30k on one phone,  buy two at 15-16k each. This strategy has worked for me very well. What's most fascinating part about the last 24 hours is the Samsung app that moved some 28 GB of data files from my Moto in no time, effortlessly.  This is huge.

So should you buy M31? Unless you are a high end gamer the answer is YES.

Having owned a top range galaxy S8 which did not live upto its quality, I was pretty sure I did not want to spend a ruppee more than 15-16k of my hard earned money. Clearly did not want a Chinese brand so opted for this one and boy I am surprised by the specs, battery, screen resolution, camera, overall performance you name it. Speaker quality is okay but if you use headphone for music or watching your latest show this will be of your least concern. You will need a phone cover coz the polycarbonate is definitely a fingerprint magnet.

When phone like these can address all your needs then why to spend crazy amount of money ? Usse accha Sensex mein daalo appreciation hoga:) Be prudent.

Moved from a Moto G5s Plus to Samsung .
Pros :
1. S-amoled display is just fluid , smooth and oh ghosh the deep blacks and the punchy colors . Undoubtedly the best display under 17K .
2. 6000mah battery easily lasts for a day and half with heavy usage like 2hrs of Pubg , lots of social media stuff , photographs . The POWER MODE especially is phenomenal .
3. 64Mp Camera is a beast when it comes to details but the 16MP ( pixel binning ) auto mode is the best where this device shines as the HDR and algorithms by samsung are just so perfect . No image over processing nothing . The Ultra Wide is the best as said by many top reviewers and it has distortion correction as well where as the Macro camera captures details and quality as it's a 5MP shooter .
4. Exynos 9611 well its brilliant . Don't go for the benchmarks . Performance is superb bcz of the optimization . No lags and stutters . PUBG plays at HD and High frame rates by default and plays smoothly as well . That was a surprise to me also bcz I never thought of exynos handling games so good .
5. The phone is not too heavy and looks pretty good overally and the Dolby atmos has its own magic when you're connected to bluetooth or wired headphones .
6. The fingerprint scanner and the face unlock are supremely fast unlocks within a second and the Samsung UI over android 10 makes this phone the best midranger out there .

Cons :

1. The speakers of the phone naturally reduce while playing PUBG but it's not the case in playing other games .
2. The back of the phone is plastic and thus it's a fingerprint magnet genuinely. Do buy a back cover for avoiding scratches.

After using the phone for 3 months, i am writing this review.

Pros:
- Battery backup
- Dual 4G Dual WiFi calling
- High Quality LED Display
- Camera in HDR mode
- Sleek design
- Speed

Cons:
- initially had restarting issues, later resolved after software update
- Heats up on long video calls and battery drains fast due to high quality video
- Camera could have been better, zooms in digital mode, not optical
- Security lock function for each app not available

Overall an excellent phone at this price range with an excellent battery backup. You cannot expect a DSLR clarity for this price even if you have a 128 pixel in Digital zoom.

If you are willing to buy only for a high quality camera, not a good choice. I have attached some shots, you can have a look and decide. Otherwise i am happy with my purchase 6 GB RAM &amp; 128 GB Storage with a pretty good speed of operations.

Phone is ok.
Battery is good enough, this is the only plus point.
Face detection does not work very poor,
OTG is very good, Doc. Files transferred open directly without going through any app.
Keyboard features not good in comparison to Google.
Camera quality is very bad, white light turns blue, good pictures turn out very deep coloured.
Palm screen shot does not work so the time.
Adaptive screen doesn't work.
Phone is slow.
Power on off is missing.
Plastic back cover gets scratched very fast.
Videos plays in 2 steps, one in off volume.
Samsung phones are not good for gear S2 watches, it connects through Samsung galaxy store which which does not show all the faces as In other phones &amp; it also does not show the purchased watch faces.
There is a feature of Zip apps, which is of no use bcoz if you zip an app you can't use it, so what's the purpose of zipping? And after unzipping apps get lost.
Photo editor is not good enough,,,

Its been 10 days since i have started using the phone. There are certain things i'd like to mention.

Pros: great camera, you get the best pictures even in dim light (YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH REALME PICTURES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT USE FILTERS, IT GIVES HIGH QUALITY PICTURES, IF U NEED BEAUTIFICATION THEN THE FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE IN CAMERA SETTINGS), finger print reader is upto the mark, screen is very handy, it has got some great inbuilt features, speakers are good for one room echo,face detection is also one great feature in it. Battery  is one great perk. I charge it once in 1.5 days.

Cons: hangs a lot while transferring file to another phone,occationally malfunctions and restarts without command, follows command with a little delay at some point, as compared to my MI A1 i find this phone a little not upto the mark in terms of performance. Super slow in charging. It looks like it takes for ever to charge.

Apart from the camera i dont think it has anything super good to discuss. Its like a regular phone that one can buy.
 We as youngsters  are more obsessed with the camera thing and battery life, hence this phone is everything in terms of those. I haven't played games on it and hence i dont know how will that be.
I am rating it 5 beacuse the cons i mentioned are temporary, it does not affect over all performance. I am satisfied i keep downloading files, use microsoft office on it, play youtube,click pictures and little stuffs so it works fine for me.

Samsung Galaxy M31 gives you a very high value for the price. Given my price range and the features I was looking for, it was hands-down the best smartphone in the market right now.
At this price range, Samsung offers a lot of features in this smartphone that the other brands have not. For example -  AMOLED SCREEN, An enormous 6000 mAh battery and also a 64-megapixel quad-camera!!!
This phone makes watching movies a pleasure due to the AMOLED screen for immersive viewing experience and the Dolby Sound as a cherry on the cake.
I also, do recommend this product for novice photographers.
Conclusion: I am freaking loving this smartphone

I have noticed below issues with phone.
* camera: it cuts photo frame in ouput photo due to this u do not get actual image of what seen on screen, it cut about a inch from sides.
* battery: takes tooooo long to charge if phone is made on charging at 20% than it takes 3 hours to reach in nineties that too if no other work is done and phone is kept idle.
Also battery drains out easily
* Heating issue: phone is getting hot at charging time, regular use of data. And not only back screen too gets hot considerably.
While video calling pop up comes that whatsapp is making phone hot, close whatsapp otherwise will close in 20 sec.

Battery life is great as it easily lasts for over 48 hrs of usage in single charge. Vibrant colours - probably the best and refreshing colour combinations (especially in the dark mode) for menus and adaptive colour and brightness settings are top notch. Smart and smooth UI is simple to use and highly responsive, Samsung has added some of the new cool features to the UI which are very useful. Fast processor (I am not a gamer) functions without any lag. Camera quality is Fantastic in good light conditions including the front camera, the picture taken are very close to their natural colours. Overall an excellent value for money. Go for it. Highly recommended.

Writing this review after two weeks of usage. The phone has some weight to it, which is something I was looking for and it really feels good to hold in hand just like the old rugged Motorola's.
Display and the battery capacity are something which impressed me a alot and I can definitely vouch for it. Camera is also cool, but not that great, but it is good enough for the price you pay.
The only thing I am little disappointed was it has some lag while browsing and if it is improved, the phone really rocks for the price.
Overall when compared to chinese phones in the market, Samsung is really doing good in terms of service, trust and the value of the product.
Also, would like to thank Amazon for fast delivery and awsome service.

I thoroughly like this mobile.
Very smooth to handle.
The camera is very good in day light and medium to low light.
The battery back up is awesome. It took 40 hours for the mobile battery to go from 100 % to 23 %. In this timeframe I had medium usage of the mobile also I used it with wats app live tracking with GPS on for my cycling trip for 8 hours. Also around 3 hours of Google map use.
Though I cannot comment much on gaming experience as I don't play games on mobile, but just to experience played subway surfers for 10 minutes and it performed good.
Overall a good buy for me as I was searching for a mobile with nice camera and battery.

I have a good working phone -samsung A8 plus.. still purchased this phone as I  was excited with its features of 64 MP camera and 6000 mAmp battery-- both these features are a huge disappointment in this phone
no differnce from A8+ - or even worse
no back cover/screen guard; purchased them online, before they come and start using this phone -return window expired..
No fast charging as claimed, infact very very slow charging.......

atleast no heating issues like other cheaper brands
screen, touch sensitivity, fast processor -- are good
sound is again a disappointment
slow motion video and live focus on both cameras, both sim Volte enabling  - are the good features

Writing this review after 10 days of usage.
Pros:
1. Samsung's Super AMOLED Screen
2. Massive 6000 mAh battery
3. 64 MP Quad Camera
4. One UI 2.0 based on Android 10 out of the box
5. Dolby Atmos Support
Cons:
1. Exynos 9611 is fair enough to handle the daily work but it's a little old processor, it would be better if it would come with any of the latest ones.
2. Fingerprint sensor is adequately fast but it's a capacitive and back mounted. It would be better if it would have in display one.
3. The phone has a massive 6000 mAh battery and it supports fast charging only upto 15 watt. It would be better if would support 25 watt because it takes quite a time to charge the battery fully.
N.B. I am not a gamer. I haven't done any gaming. You will need to go to YouTube for gaming reviews.

Excellent product..the specifications of this phone are truly amazing and not just on paper , the performance  of the phone doesn't let you down at any instant. The fingerprint reader is quick to respond and has no delay in unlocking the phone.  The camera is the highlight of this phone which allows users to capture splendid pictures (64MP) I myself have clicked numerous  pictures and haven't  faced any issues with the camera. The battery  life of this phone is more than adequate  for daily usage as well as gaming(performs well while running heavy games also).
 I'm extremely  pleased with the product and would recommend  this phone to anyone  looking for a smooth and hassle free experience.

YOU SHOULD KNOW WHY THIS IS SUPER MONSTER. MUST-READ.
Samsung has literally poured premium qualities in this phone.

1)CAMERA - Quad Camera rich quality photos. Even after Zoom, details are very clear &amp; No blurs at all. low light snaps are clear &amp; stunning. Compared to under 20k Chini brands like (Viv/opp/Rme/Rmi) this is unmatchable.

2)SENSORS - All sensors are quick, most importantly they're consistent &amp; reliable (Which indicates its durability, Quality &amp; long-lasting capacity).

3)DISPLAY - Super AMOLED + Full HD = Baap of all displays. Glorifying video experience. Touch Response is quick &amp; so far no single glitch.

4)MUSIC QUALITY - Built-in DOLBY ATMOS technology. You'll experience the distinct Thump of bass. (also depends upon on the quality of your headphones like How much it supports to this technology)

5)CALL QUALITY- Premium mic quality. Crisp &amp; Clear voice calls. Supports almost all CODECS including Aptx

6) RAM - Best RAM management, even after you play heavy graphics games along with complex tasks, you'll see approx 1.5gb still left. That means your phone is breathing easily even in heavy usage. NO HEATING.

7) PROCESSOR - Many Reviewers are misleading on this by comparing snapdragon. but, few this months old Exynos 9611 chipset has mastered with 6GB ram to ensure thriving experience &amp; to perform any task no matter what you doing on your phone. So far No complaint about the performance &amp; during multitasking &amp; Gameplay.

8)GAMEPLAY - Heavy graphics GamePlay like Ark, pubg, Minecraft etc are fluent. So far No frame drop, even in high settings. Recommending to use Built-in Game Booster feature for Thriving Gaming experience along with AMOLED graphics. Just Imagine.

9)BATTERY - 6000mAh juice will give you an output of approx 2 Days on avg use &amp; 1 day(20hrs) on heavy usage.

SUMMARY -  If you looking for a maintenance-free consistent device for 3-4 years then Go for It without hegitation.

After using the Samsung Galaxy M31 with 6 GB ram and 128 GB storage for more than 2 months, I list following pros and cons:
A. Pros
1. Very good display quality. Watching videos is a delightful experience
2. Quad camera and selfie camera are very good. Low light photos in night mode are excellent with the 64MP main camera
3. Fingerprint sensor is very accurate and fast
4. Apps load quickly as expecte
B. Cons
1. Battery life is not as expected from 6000 mAH massive battery. Lasts about one and half days with normal use. Few phones with smaller batteries last for same time.
2.charging the battery fully takes a very long time (about 2 hrs 15 mins from 15% to 100%) inspite of "fast charging", which is very disappointing.
Overall the phone is very good and highly recommended.

The Box Contents :
The Phone, Charger(15W), C-Type Charging-cum-usb Cable, Some Related Papers

First Impressions :
The Package was packed well and the Samsung  Box was compact.
The phone has a impresive design and the weight was well distributed.

After a week usuge:
1. Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained  even in bright sunlight  you see the display  pretty  well. The viewing  angles  are also good. No color  changes  when views angles  gets changed. No queries  from my side.

2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla  Glass 3 protection  at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared  to other phones  of this budget  section( of course thanks to massive battery).

3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.

4. Front Camera: Performed  well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed  texture  on the face(just turn off the Beauty  effect) and the one of the main function  is that during  calls, front camera  is used as ambient  light sensor  to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's  all about the habbit  that is to be developed with time.

5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played  musics of high  frequency  and bass, at high sound it losses  it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.
The ear piece sound quality  is exceptionally  great.

6. Rear Cameras:  The design  of Quad Cameras  impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.

The 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice  the overall  quality  of normal 16MP photos  are a bit rich as compared  to 64MP photos as capturing  image in 64MP and rendering  it to 16MP increases  it's  quality.

The Live Focus  is impressive and the blurring  edge of the photos  is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial  lighting.  I am satisfied very well.

The wide camera Performed  pretty  well and got satisfactory  results.

I am bit disappointed  with the Macro Lens that didn't  performed well, however  in multiple  shots I got a good quality  macro photo. But using main camera  for macro photos gives great results.

The LED was pretty  good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally  well.

7. Battery:  Yes the massive  6000mAH battery  is worth  called massive. I got the screen-on period  of 10hours in a single  charge.  On using it in a average way gave me around  30 hours of backup.

8. Performance:  I experienced  buttery smooth  performance in using  it in above average usage.  But I will say that you can get  a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance  as it doesn't  got a gaming  processor.
But in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.

The only visible  difference  between  M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement  of secondary  mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which  is on the right in M30s

As a average user 60Hz display  is okay for me, I didn't  experienced  any frame  drops.

Overall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.

I will reccomend  this product  for average  users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.

Complete package at the price point.
Amazing camera and great battery life. Plays games like PUBG without any issues at all, didn't feel excessive heat after half hour play either. 128 GB memory should last for everyone.
Dolby is a great addition.

Before buying this phone, I had some doubt but after using this for almost one month, I am üíØ percent sure to say that, Samsung mid range phones are shit,
Front camera quality is as bad as VGA one,
Rear camera: always struggles to focus on close clicks, this phone has 64 MP camera but even my 16 MP phone camera perform far better, I can share the pics for comparison,
Battery: this phone comes with 6000 battery but works as 4500 battery back up, maximum 12 hours, and the slow charging add more dimerit to it,
Display: good,
Performance: bad, very very bad, I don't know if my phone has some problem or Samsung is just proving it's  legacy of bad performaing mid range phones, this phone starts lagging while opening very normal apps, like WhatsApp, and YouTube, in have to say that m31 is  1.5 second slow in opening any app in comparison with my 4 GB RAM  cell phone.
Design: does not feel sleek and premium in hand due to plastic body, but we could take that bulky design if battery works as expected because it has 6000 mah battery in it, but battery performance of this phone is simply bad.

Sorry Samsung for this critical and negative review, but I have to say that you need to work on your midrange phones as well,

The phone is very good in everyday usage.

The only problem faced is that the phone automatically switches to WiFi calling while making or receiving a call despite turning off WiFi calling. The network is Airtel.

This results in a situation where once the call starts, data gets switched off. No internet connectivity. So cannot talk and connect to internet simultaneously.

Am writing this after a lot of googling to find a fix for this.

The phone has April 1 2020 patch applied.

Can Samsung or anyone out there help fix this problem?

Also let me know if it is an Operator related issue (please mention what the operator needs to fix) so I can talk to the concerned.

Battery: 10/10
Display: 10/10
Sound: 10/10 (Don't expect stereo effect sound at this price. The Dolby Atmos effect that you get through the earphones is however appreciable.)
Look &amp; Feel: 9/10 (It has a plastic back, but at this price, a plastic back is justifiable).
Camera: 9/10 (I am not a big fan of cellphone camera, but intial impression is 9/10.)
User Experience: 9/10 (The phone does not lag as of 5 days of usage. I have disabled most of the Samsung apps, but still few Samsung apps can't be uninstalled or disabled.)

Best features, Ergonomics: The two best things about the phone are its 6000 mah battery and its weight balance which makes it feel way lighter than its 192 grams. The polycarbonate back means you don't need a case and can use this phone bareback which is nice(just rub down with a damp cloth from time to time to get rid of the fingerprints) A faux leather back would have been better but nothing much to complain about.

 Battery: On the battery front, the performance is exceptional(7.5 hours on lte and medium brightness, and 13 hours on wifi) and if you switch off the phone and charge, it can charge up from 20% in under 2 hours.

 Camera: The camera was really bad out of the box but got a massive upgrade in especially low light images after the February patch. Samsung are likely to further improve the camera with updates. One irritation currently is that you can't use the flash and the wide angle at the same time which makes no sense.

 Performance: Performance is good for day to day tasks especially if you go to the settings and "reduce animations" You can also use ram and cache cleaning apps on the playstore to clean your ram and cache with a single click from time to time.

 Hardware: Gyroscope and compass are there. Samsung used to skimp on these in the past. A macro lens is also available along with the ultrawide. Unfortunately no IR blaster and no zoom lens(depth sensor instead) Also no Samsung Pay or Knox security

Display: The display gets better if you tweak it. Out of the box, you get somewhat warm colors. You can also hide the notch the same way as the M30s(look it up on YouTube) Because it is an amoled screen, this works perfectly and you get an uninterrupted display. Overall good experience

Sound: The sound of the earphone jack is not punchy but there is no distortion or noise either so good for soft music. You can probably improve the output further with a third party equalizer. The single speaker is clear and reasonably loud. No distortion and good for speech. But not punchy or good for playing music(but then that's what Bluetooth speakers are for)

Software: You get Android 10 out of the box. I had heard that some people had trouble with using vpn apps after an Android 10 update but fortunately that's not true. Only software con so far is that a native screen recorder is not a available out of the box(so there may be no way of recording internal audio) Further you can't sideload apps from a third party file explorer. You have to use the built in one. We have to see if it improves with updates. Also you have a screen flash and camera flash feature you can turn on for notifications in the absence of a led notification light

 Who should buy: People who want the sharpest data capture on their camera and the best gaming performance may look elsewhere, but if you want a reliable rom(I have had files corrupted, especially those on the micro sd card on multiple occasions with MIUI especially during updates), top class battery life, good customer service, and a good quality amoled screen with perfect notch hiding, this is a really good phone. The lack of Samsung Pay is annoying and the main reason for cutting a star. Other things like the older processor were already on the table

To be frank!! I didn't find any usefull thing in M31 but we want to spend the money only for brand the only reason to buy this is for superamloed display finger print reader is slow when we are receiving calls it display after 10sec call reception is also slow samsung  must be concentrate on UI camera is good battery life is excellent but I didn't test how many minutes it will take to charge the full battery
  The worst thing is charger other brands are providing best cable and adapter when we touch the other brand chargers we feel like premium but samsung chargers are worst like 100 rs road side chargers and also back panel attracts the fingers easily samsung should concentrate on lot of improvements in UI
  Apart this the mobile is good one who are not students if you are a student to buy this you are must be a normal users not heavy users

I will say excellent phone overall. Amazing camera quality and battery life. Phone speed is perfect and screen touch and navigation  is awesome. Over all for people who have issues with Samsung this phone, i do not agree as i am experiencing  best mobile phone. Camera quality is perfect and features  are so easily accessible. Under 20 k if someone is looking for  perfect and durable mo ile phone, then bilndedly go for this without hesitation. Amazon too delivered very fast and there was no issie in transferring  previous phone data to this one. Thank you Samsung  and thank you Amazon.

Positives:
Great battery life
Nice screen, thank you amoled
Convenient features, fast connectivity (Bluetooth, wifi)
Has not frozen once. No software issues yet
Negatives:
Face recognition and finger print recognition are iffy.
Front facing camera is not sharp at all. Looks like my 2008 computer built in webcam
Samsung apps that can't be removed. (Why add bloatware that no one uses anyways?)
Plastic body while Redmi has metal bodies at the same price point

Still, a great phone at this price. I keep hearing rumors about how Samsung phones slow down after a few years, I'll see if that's the case and update this review accordingly. But right now, I do recommend buying it.

It is the best phone for the budget from a brand lik samsung all though there is small flaws lik the main 64mp cam is a wide angle lens which looks a bit odd wit a slight fish eye effect and in low lighting it produces lot of noise but u get good detailing and the colour reproduction is amazing and lastly the processor could hv been even better i feel its not that its bad now but still could hv been better overall i rate an 8/10 for the mobile and s 1 more thing u should be aware of is that it doesn't support Samsung pay and Knox. Thank you for your time in taking time reading my comment hv fun peace ‚úåÔ∏è continuing my review after 3 days of usage i could find that charging time takes almost 2 and half hrs and sometimes 3 even though it supports fast charging upto 3hrs

Initially, when I got the phone, I encountered the problem during startup, refer to the attached picture but after getting the technical assistance from the Amazon team, I was able to successfully launch my phone and i am not facing any problem after that.
Pros:
1. The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.
2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.
3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.
4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.

Cons:
1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.
2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.

Overall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.

Amoled display very Sharp and vivid.

Battery life excellent ...hardly 30 to 40 percent battery down if you are moderate user and not playing continuous game.
OS is smooth.

CAMERA need to improve , need to check software upgrades but it's not too bad ,only we need to search for better software.

Finger print reader is fast.

Go for 6 GB and 128 GB option so no need to worry about space issue.

9611 samsung equinox processor works well no lagging observed ( i am also using 1st time this processor ...otherwise I prefer SD processor).

Charging require 3 hours to full charge..it is just 15 watts charger but dont worry battery performance is great so hardly need to charge.

Samsung really pack monster under 20k ( Best price offered.)

Best phone offered by Samsung....go for itüëå

I am using this phone from 7 days and in the seven days I have reviewed it and below are my observations:
Unlock speed-
Unlock speed using face recognition and fingerprint sensor is really super fast. you will not feel any lag while unlocking the phone it will open it up with just in fraction of a second
Camera -
Having 64 MP camera in a budget of this phone is really unexpected you can click eye catching pictures using front and back camera the back camera has 4 sensors which allows you to click macros, depth , Wide Angle and normal pictures in high definition quality.
the front camera which is 32 MP allows you to click steady pictures with wide angle for group selfies as well
Battery life and charging -
Well, with the battery life I am not that much satisfied as I expected it to be. Having 6000mAh, it lasts for 1 complete day which is good, I liked it. But I thought it will last more longer, but since it has sampled display and 6GB Ram and super fast processor, it takes probably more power. But battery performance will not disappoint you, I used this mobile for Internet surfing, video calls, Netflix and YouTube and it was pretty good. Charging takes time because it has a huge battery in it, so it will take around 3 hours to fully charge it.
Performance -
Over all, the mobile's performance is really fast with Samsung's own processor and 6gb Ram you will not feel any lag while using this phone and it has latest Android and security patch level so you will always enjoy while using so many apps in the background.

Overall summary -
In this budget you are getting the features of a 20 to 25 k mobile and Samsung is a reliable brand you can trust on. It's made in India mobile so you can definitely use this mobile without any hassle so go to amazon Amazon Samsung website, buy your mobile, start using it and enjoy!

I will be completely honest about my review after 2 days of ordinary usage...

If you are attracted to this phone because of 64MP camera then wait a minute...my iPhone 5s with 8MP takes better photos than this phone.
I don't know it's hardware or software issue. The software can be fixed with future updates.  Photos are blurry in all kinds of shots.  What is "Macro"?
I don't understand.  It takes completely unfocused blurry pics.
So if you are buying Rs.15000 phone for the camera then NO...

I won't discourage the people who want to buy it for performance. It's fabulous in that department.
6GB RAM really helps anyhow?
I don't know...I find little lag during jumping to multiple apps...
But I am satisfied with the product because Camera is not a priority for me.

Additionally I don't know how many ours should a battery last with 6000mAh with moderate use but for me it lasts for 24hr on average without gaming.

Fingerprint: 4/5
Battery: 4/5
Camera: 1/5
Performance: 3/5

Overall: 3/5.

The mobile is a typical Samsung phone nothing special. The only attraction is quad camera and that too is not good, picture quality is like 8 MP camera. I exchanged my Vivo V9 with it and now i'm regretting it. Vivo V9 was far better than M31. If you are going by smart look and quad camera than i am sure this phone will disappoint you.

I BOUGHT THIS PHONE WITHOUT THINKING, BUT AFTER USE I FOUND THAT THIS DEVICE DO NOT HAVE SAMSUNG SECURE FOLDER, SAMSUNG PAY OR PAY MINI, KNOX SECURITY, SAMSUNG PASS ETC. THE ABSENCE OF THESE THINGS IS NOT BEARABLE. I WILL CHANGE THE DEVICE AFTER SOMETIME WAIT IF ABOVE MENTIONED FACILITY NOT UPDATED IN SOFTWARE UPDATE LATER.
A SIMPLE 6000 MAH BATTERY CAN BY OTHER BRAND IN VERY LOWER PRICE. CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT 64 MP EQUAL. THIS PHONE HAVE ONLY BATTERY AND DISPLAY.
BUY THIS PHONE AFTER CHECKING ALL FEATURE.

I WILL CHANGE MOBILE BECAUSE MOBILE DO NOT HAVE SAMSUNG SECURE FOLDER, SAMSUNG PAY OR PAY MINI ETC.

Good thing is that I got the phone delivered withing just 4 hours on the launch date in March 2020.

As per suggestion I updated phone immediately

The look and feel is nice. Phone quality is good. Also it has AI features in the camera. E.g I can point the phone camera to Text and it can translate, I can point phone to pics, cars etc, and I can information about it.

Phone charging is good. It has fast charging, but since battery is 6000 mAH, it takes long time to charge, no complaint about it.

However I have experience the phone hanging on the usual applications such as Google Chrome, Internet explorer. The Text box does not open up. I need to close the application and reopen it so that I can type the URL, search criteria of my choice.

Once this phone restarted on its own.

Also I have experienced that the Mobile data turns off automatically and it does not get on even though in the settings the Mobile data is turned on.

Like most of the people I am using Data from JIO which is inserted in SIM1. Today I set the data for SIM 1, no idea how it got selected for SIM2. Please note that I have not opted for Data in the SIM 2 and hence whenever the data from SIM2 is used then heavy charges are applied.

Because of these issues I faced giving 3 stars.

After 3 months, I experience the hanging once every week.

Gets heat up a lot on video calls of WhatsApp, Zoom and Duo calls and restarts automatically.

This mobile has 6000mah battery but it last only one day.camera is not so good according to it megapixels.fingerprint some times not working but almost good.display and touch is good. The major problem is it's hanging. I am using this phone for last 45 days and it hangs 3 to 4 times and it takes 5 to 10 minutes and some times more to start working after hanging.i have Faith on Samsung but this hanging problem annoying me badly.Samsung needs to improve this issues.All other things are good.

Overall  nice mobile! But charging speed is little bit slow minimum it requires 3 hrs for full charge from 0 to 100% . Except that I can't even find out any issues! No heating problems unlike other mobiles . mobile case is not provided  by Samsung . Camera quality is awesome. Fingerprint sensor speed and  recognition is fine. Minimum 1.5 day you can use this mobile with out any worries about charging even heavy usage. Overall One of the best mobile from Samsung in this price range. So surely I will  recommend this mobile to my friends.

I purchased this phone for my dad. But i used it for 4-5 days. And on that basis i can say that:
‚Ä¢ The performance of the phone is very smooth. I don't find any hanging problem.
‚Ä¢ The battery life of this phone is amazing. If you are using your phone without internet then the battery life works for 3-5 days.
‚Ä¢ The camera quality of the rear is nice but front cam is not up to that point. It's like you are using front cam with an beauty editor.
‚Ä¢ As you all know about the screen, it's just awesome.
‚Ä¢ And other functions of the phone starts properly.
Before purchasing this phone. I compared it to many of the smartphones. And trust me this tops at first in this range. So, if your budget is around 15000 u can go for it without any doubt.

I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks and the battery feels like 3000mAh at best.

I have used 5000mAh phones from Asus and Panasonic before and those phone easily gave 1.5 to 2 days usage. With the advertised capacity and with a below average processor this should last longer.

I am an average user mostly on WiFi and rarely uses mobile data. Very difficult to use it on second day without charging.

Charges very slowly and discharges fast. It should have been the other way around.

Performance is average. Try to stay away from Exynos processors if you want a reasonably fast phone. But I knew this before buying, so no complaints here

Camera seems decent, but I rarely takes photos and don't think I have enough knowledge to comment on the camera quality

Consider Other choices also.

Quality 6.4 AMOLED Display in FHD, that is  very comfortable to hold inspite of the mega battery that lasts more than a full day with really heavy usage.

Screen on time is easily 13-14 hrs after a full charge ,that takes around 2.5 hrs. So no more worries.

Touch sensitivity is very good.speaker volume ,call volume, reception are all adequate.Core UI 2 performs well with android 10 out of box and prompt me to update to latest patch on initial setup.No visible lag in daily use with DDR4 ram and UFS 2.1 memory. Finger print reader is snappy with no delay. Gamers may not find the same level of performance in exynos processor as a snapdragon .

Camera performance is good in the daylight.Night mode not good with little enhancements.Wide lens is OK,macro shots are average.Camera software has lot of options to explore. Video recording comes with EIS.selfie also poor.

Build quality is not OK considering the plastic back while competitors are offering gorilla glass panel.
No notification LED.
Network signal is very poor compared to my old lenova.Think twice before buying since only replacement is offered by Amazon.

Everything is okey except below:

1) Camera is getting blurry when you fully zoom for long distance images. It should not happen if its 64MP and one of its USP
2) Speaker volume is very Low
3) Can not split display while you are already on another app
4) Can not connect internet through WPS
5) Poor in facelock sensor
6) Palm swipe to capture screen shot is not working always.. It should be 100% accurate then only it works..

Rest all superb with this price

I have been using this phone for a while now ... And in lockdown situation this phone has given me good support.

Fingerprint reader works fine and is located at back. But i am using the face recognition. I feel its better . I tried using my photos to unlock the phone .... No luck ... Works only with my face...

Camera quality is good .... From a layman's perspective these are gr8 . From a photographer perspective they are just good. Depth camera gives good bokeh...
Macro camera is good

Battery Life is just amazing ... I use this with all office communication apps and still get more than 2 days out of it ... Seriously i am just way toooo happy with it.

Not happy with below:

Phone is a little heavy because of monster battery
Knox is replaced with McAfee

I even tried some games like pubg and call of duty ... Seem to work fine for me ... So overall a monster (excellent) Phone

I received this on 20 March 2020.

I have used Redmi note3 , Redmi note4 and micromax yurekha before coming to One Plus 7T. My experience so far with this:
1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.
2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. But this one is Mind blowing and amazing. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. Amazing Camera
3. Battery: One of the best from Samsung mobiles. I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom.
4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast.
5. After using my previous mobiles, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight.

6. i don't have any Complaints on this phone. Finally I love Samsung Galaxy M31.

Go for it guys !! You won't regret. My rating 4.5/5.. :)

This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Good:

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
- Received next day by 11 AM !

The product was a previously used one. This is shocking,  I've bought iPhone, iPads,  Macbook and HP laptops plus others thousands from Amazon and didn't expect this. Really disappointing.

I wish I could give 6 stars to the battery life... Just amazing. I'm not a very heavy user so i get about 2 days backup. I switched on to power saver at 30% once and got one full day extra, can't imagine how long would it last on ultra power saver.

The camera is really good and beautifully captures all colours.

The screen is flawless. Amoleds, as you'd expect!

The fingerprint is a bit slow sometimes but is quick to unlock. The responsiveness decreases for a short time if you've just turned the phone on.

The software is awesome. The out-of-the-box software is a bit unstable but a recent update fixed it. Clean and shiny interface but with a few apps preinstalled, which can be uninstalled.

I don't play much games but I played CoD and what a gameplay it gives... Smooth as butter. Overheats if you play for long although performance decrease is not too much.

Thanks!

Here is review-
1. As claimed the strongest part of this phone is Mega Battery and it's TRUE in every term. With moderate use throughout the day Battery was down to 80% only from full charged in morning. I watched movies for another 2 hours continuously reducing only 10% further to 70%. charging 1 hr was sufficient to get back to 100%. Totally Impressive!!
2. Camera is phenomenal. Wide angle, super slomo video, hyperlapse, clicks with auto adjustment, night mode, zoom.. all are best in every term. I have attached few clicks &amp; videos. Check out
3. Very user friendly functions. Everything seems so simple. That's best part too.
4. I used Samsung smart switch app to transfer my entire data from my old android phone to this one. Without any hiccups totally got that done in one go everything including messages, call records. Everything in matter of hour. Seamless experience.
4. You can create your own emoji. Best part- you can use while using camera too!

Overall totally happy with the purchase of this mobile.

The above stars are only for battery, AI features and camera.

2) WIDE ANGLE CAMERA IS NOT CLEAN IF YOU TRY TO ZOOM IN AT ANY PARTICULAR OBJECT

4) POSITION OF SPEAKER IS POOR AS IT GETS BLOCKED WITH FINGERS WHILE PLAYING GAMES OR TEXTING . THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DUAL SPEAKER.

3) NO HEADPHONE AND COVER INSIDE THE BOX

4)GIVEN 6000MAH BATTERY , IT WILL LAST ONLY 1/2 HALF DAYS , WHICH IS OK COMPARED TO OTHER MOBILES

5) 15W CHARGER TAKES 2:30 hrs TO COMPLETE 100%, WHERE AS IF YOU CHARGE THEM THROUGH Mi POWER BANK WITH 18W SPEED IT COMPLETES BIT QUICKER.

6) BIT SLIPPERY IN CORNERS COZ OF WHICH FINDING DIFFICULT TO PLAY GAMES. HOWEVER CASE CAN ELIMINATE THIS ISSUE

7) POOR NIGHT VISION CAMERA.

8) FINGER PRINT UNLOCKER  AS USUAL POOR IN SAMSUNG

PROS:

- FRONT AND BACK CAMERA ARE AWESOME UNDER LIGHTING.

It's a  mega monster  at this price segment ü§ñ I'll tell you the pros and cons
Pros :
‚û°Ô∏èSuper amoled display was so cool, you can't  find this kind of display on this price segment on another brand's....
‚û°Ô∏è Camera is also so cool, I can't say it's a crystal clear  cam, but it's so cool on this price segment...
‚û°Ô∏è It's too handy as well, with curvy edges  it's fit your hand so cool, you won't even feel it's 191 grams weigh....
‚û°Ô∏èExynos 9611 (10nm) Chipset is good to  play high graphics games too....Games like pubg starts with high quality graphics on default,  Almost it's equal to Snapdragon 712 Chipset...
‚û°Ô∏è It's doesn't matter that you are a heavy user,the 6000 mah will easily make it a day easily without any issues...
‚û°Ô∏è Ear piece is good as well, no issues on receiving sounds...

‚ö†Ô∏èCons...

‚û°Ô∏è  Macro cam mode is not that good as we expected....
‚û°Ô∏è As so far, I can't find any more issues....

Hope it'll help :)

Thanks for the Samsung( really I'm in song with it) for an all in one mobile set at an effective price. Till date,I am not a big fan of Samsung, as they produced mobiles at a bit expensive rate in comparison to other companies producing the same features at a lower price, but with this product, they completely got above everyone. Have been using it from past 3 days, the mobile amazed me with its battery backup, the camera was too good. While watching videos, it was a colorful and bright experience. I haven't experienced any pause while using applications till now. The finger print sensor is very fast in response. Over all to sum it up, it was a pretty good buy at this price. I suggest fellow buyers to go with 128gb rather than 64gb, as you are getting it, just for an extra 1000.

Purchsed one on launch. Had almost made up my mind to buy M30s but saw notification of this M31 being launched so kept my purchase on hold. The features were good at the price. The wait was worthy. Now using almost since 3 months.
Truely monster battery. With my use easily lasts bit more than 2 days. Fast charging supported. 50% charged within about 40 min with the provided 9V charger. This is sufficient for a day if one is in hurry to leave for work. By the time one gets ready the phone can be charged 50% almost.
Full charge takes about 2.30 hrs. Samsung should have provided a 15 V charger in box as they provide to all the YouTube reviewers. All reviewers spoke of inbox 15W charger.
I would have given 5 star rating in all categories then.
The finger print scanner occasionally fails to unlock with finger print. Have to press the lock button and unlock again with the finger then. Don't know the reason why this happens.
Though I am not a selfie lover or one who keeps on clicking photos often, I found the camera quality good enough, both front and back.
Sound quality is ok. Though feel the speaker could have been bit louder.
No doubts about Samsung amoled display, it's the best. Samsung being pioneer in this. Very bright even with low settings.
Signal reception has no problem.
Expandable memory is a good feature we usually do not see now in flagship phones also.
Overall good product at this price. Go for it.

Pros--

1. SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY
  Yes the main purpose to purchase this phone is the display experience if u love to watch YouTube, Movies, Songs, etc. don't think just go for it. The sAMOLED display quality feels you premium which cannot provide by other brands in this price range. Samsung sAMOLED  is excellent compare to other brands sAMOLED.(I.e. realme, etc.)

2. 64MP QUAD CAMERA, 32MP FRONT
  CAMERA
  Camera quality is awesome. It is improved compare to M30s 48mp triple rear, 16mp front camera and gives u more details while clicking pics. But when taking low light photos it performs average, sometimes details are missing and gives u blur photos.

Note: Price is 15k not expect too much because other brands also lack in low light photos in this price range.

3. 6000mah BATTERY
  Battery backup is pretty good because sAMOLED display consumes less battery compare to (IPS)LCD, TFT display. It gives u 1.5 days battery backup which cannot given by 4000mah, 5000mah.

4. ONE UI, 6GB RAM
  Samsung one ui gives u time to time updates at least 2 yrs and above. It feels u cool compare to miui, realme mi etc. 6gb ram in this price range is just awesome because samsung A series will not provide this in 15k.

Cons--

1. EXYNOS 9611 OCTA CORE PROCESSOR
  Samsung M30s is also come with this processor. Samsung should also upgrade the processor and give at least Qualcomm sd675 or above this time. Exynos 9611 is gud for daily purpose but if u are heavy gamer then it feels u bad. This processor is now outdated this time. Performance of exynos 9611 is similar to sd660 and sd665 which is below than sd675.

2. MISSING NFC, SAMSUNG PAY, KNOX
  SECURITY
  A series provide these features but M series will not which is very disappointed for samsung user. Knox Security is samsung selfmade manufactured feature that's why it should also come in M series.

3. BUILD QUALITY
  Back side build quality is just plastic so u have to use gud back cover to avoid scratches and any other harm. A series Build quality feels u premium that's why M series are cheaper compare to A series.

4. 15 WATT CHARGER
  It has massive battery 6000mah but 15 w charger is not sufficient, it takes 2.45hrs to charge the phone 0 to 100%.Samsung should upgrade this and can give atleast 27watt charger this time.

Note-

1.Samsung always try to save money and this time they also achieve this by these all 4 cons. But in my opinion it is best package in 15k because A series are very expensive if we purchasing for these features.

2. If compare to other Chinese brands samsung phones are durable for long term uses and provide many service centers everywhere to resolve issues.

Initial review
Performance  of the phone is slow for normal day to day activities.  You can lag in opening  apps like outlook, gmail and any other  day to day apps. Some items you can see lag in animation. I have changed setting to use less animation after that also seeing  the performance lags. No worth for amount.  The reason for performance  is Samsung uses their own processor  which slow.

After one week of usage
if the phone batter down to 20%, then phone will go to completely not usable state. Finally i put charge and re-started the phone to make it work.

Camera is good. Battery stands for 1.5 days for normal usage. Worst performance phone for day of day use.

Finally, here is the root of the problem. This mobile has ghost touching problem. Totally useless now.

I am writing this review after using this phone for 4day.
This is a best budget phone in the range of 15000 as whatever u want  all the things are inside this phone, if u compare this phone  With One plus 7T  Then in camera and battery backup  this phone get a Superb value. I think in this price no any phone has battery backup of 6000mah.. and really its battery is outstanding. Same thing with its main camera I.es 64 mega pixel. A Superb camera quality .. It has failed ONe plus 7t phone camera .. so best phone in this much price.
I want to explain it's some feature as below
1stly Battery 5star
2ndly camera 64mega pixel - 5star , There is a slow motion vedio making function enabled in the camera , which is really good.
3rd Front camera - 4star.
4th Processor - 4star
5th RAM - 5star I.es 6GB ram is best for Heavy application.
6th Touches - As samsung is famous for its smooth touch so - 5star. Really awesome touch
7th - Dark mode and blue light filter are also included - 4star
These all ratings are out of 5.
Now REMEDIES / DRAWBACK of this phone is
1st - It has non metal bodies, so u can't use it rough and tough .
2ndly - little bit Heating problem during the charging of phone, and using heavy memory game, or any any Heavy software.
3rd - it's back side camera is little bit outside , so there is a maximum chance of scratch.
4th - heavy weighted phone. Phone should be slim , but it is not a slim phone, it has much high thickness.
Overall , If  someone  want to buy A phone @15000, And also  He/she is  interested in photography , and need a long more battery backup then One's should must go to this phone. But if someone  want a rough n tough phone . Then he/ she  may avoid ,  as it is a non metallic body shaped phone.. And heating problem of the phone cause a huge effects..

Not a impressive phone....üòèüòè
It's  just average  product .....
I was using Lenovo k8 plus, just bought for 8k before 2 years...its working better than galaxy m31..
Dolby atmos is not working at all in galaxy m31....
I bought galaxy m31 after seeing YouTube reviews..... now only I found that they all are paid reviews...üòåüòåüôÑüôÑüôÑ

If you want a complete phone, please  choose any another brand like redmi, realme or something else

I am not satisfied with this phone...

If you have any questions,  please ask me...my cell number 8489558489

I ordered this phone and received on time. Thanks to Amazon. But once I opened the packet, the box was sealed, but the phone looked to be used already like may be for 1-2 days. There was a little scratch on the side of the phone, many applications weren‚Äôt working properly on the phone (ex: YouTube, Spotify), but eventually YouTube was fine but Spotify still has problem. I thought it to be problem of software, I reset the phone but nothing helped. Amid lockdown, I made peace with the phone but the just on the second day I was having problem with phone like my voice to the other person on calls was distorted and the other time the other person‚Äôs voice to me was distorted. I called amazon, twice thrice, but they suggested to diagnose the problem through their so called smart check application and my bad luck, and it didn‚Äôt show any problem. And for scratches, the amazon guys asked me to send photos but I don‚Äôt have DSLR to capture those small scratches (poor me). I ended up being denied for replacement or refund for the phone.

I feel I am cheated on this particular product, I have invested rs. 15999 for a not reliable phone in my hand. It may stop working any time.

Poor experience with amazon as well as the Samsung galaxy m31.

I don‚Äôt even want to keep this phone, It gave me that bad experience in just 2 days of using it. But amazon is not supporting at all.

Iam always been big fan of samsung display and camera and ever since I had used them I haven't thought ant going 4 other chinese brands with cheap LCD display on which u can neither appreciate a good pic nor game or enjoy movies on it!!

6.4" Full hd Amoled screen + 64 mp/32 mp camera + 6000 mah battery wd fast charging was too much to ignore even when MI &amp; realme were giving very competent specs at lower price but it's lcd display &amp; camera was not 4 me hence I went for M31  and it outperformed my expectations!!
From phone display to camera quality to battery life to processor it was just perfect for me in 15K..

I wud hv appreciated a gradient glossy panel but ocean blue color is actually very beautiful and shiny and phone doesn't feel heavy at all!!
Battery is huge and for full charging it does take time but it can easily last a day on 50‚ÑÖ charge for normal usage so iam not worried abt battery life and 15w charger  !!

6 GB ram is the most impressive feature of this phone,thank u samsung.

64 MP rear camera and 32 mp front were treat to click , u don't need any 3rd party app to adjust/beautify ur clicks such gr8 has been camera quality of M31!!

Slow motion recording both front and back was the feature I was looking forward to and I loved it!!

Iam not a heavy gamer but this phone can play pubg ,asphalt, mortal kombat and other heavy games wd ease!!

Finger print reader works well this time in samsung M31 !

Few tips and tricks:

By def front camera is 21 MP in order to select 32 MP option select wide-angle option and then select 3:4 full option and u will see camera size 32 mp.

For rear camera 64 mp option is available in options u hv to just look into it

Slow motion is available in both front and back camera but super slow motion is available in rear camera only! Loved that feature!

Only downside I found was knox security not present but u can always install a good antivirus to keep ur m31 safe!!
McAfee is there anyway to keep u safe!!

No complaints only praise for this beautiful and affordable monster, if ur planning to upgrade ur fone wd impressive quad camera , beautiful display and huge battery M31 will not disappoint u, it is d best phone in terms of camera, battery, display and with 6gb ram and xynos latest processor it can easily do multitasking and gaming wd ease.. I loved it,it works like a charm

The phone works great.
Display:
Most amazing display anyone can ever get in this price range. This phone's display is better than any phone in this proce range. Movie watching experience is truly amazing on this phone.

Camera:
All 4 cameras have different purpose and works fine. Camera quality is great and zoomed photos are very clear too. The display of the phone helps the camera to display it's clicked photos even better. Although i found a big issue that camera isn't able to focus at small objects placed near to it. It maybe a software problem which i am hoping would be resplved with the next update.

Interface:
The new Samsung interface is better than its previous ones. This is way more friendly and easier to use.

GPU:
A very strong processor is provided by Samsung in this phone. None of the games lag and works perfectly fine.

I purchased a Black 6/64 varient on 4th May and in 3 weeks I can confirm that I regret purchasing an iphone 7plus worth 62 thousand that too 3 years ago.
I am not a user who will zoom a picture and compare the pixals, honestly, is that needed? You dont really zoom pictures more than your phone's size so why make the hype.

About the security, I was concerned previously but as I was already using Google apps so I dont really think this scares me at all.

The performance of the phone is really amazing and the reason why is got this phone out of a number of product makes me happy everyday: 2 days battery life on good use.

Somewhere I also feel that this phone provides me more features than ios 13. I don't really miss charging my iphone twice a day lol

So, you decided to purchase the M31, based on its ratings and reviews? Then you must think about the following facts if you want to buy it:

1. If you have more money, go for a higher priced phone like A70s. This phone has the features of other phones which are in the price bracket of 18k-22k.

2. The battery backup is very good, my phone lasts 3 days on a single charge, with WiFi on all day, 2-3 hours of browsing throughout the day and moderate calling of 1-2 hours per day. However, if you want to exploit the phone by playing games all day long, you have to charge the phone everyday. Games run smooth, but this is not a gaming phone. You should target something in the price bracket of 35k+ for that purpose.

3. Phone is sturdy and looks great. Drop it from a height of 2 feet and it will be okay. Spray water on it, and still it will be ok.

4. Camera is really good for normal photography including slow mo, fast shutter speed, good colour reproduction, and daytime photography. Night time photography is decent, but don't expect it to perform like a 50k phone. It will produce photos like a 20k phone should.

5. Charging time is around 2.5 hours if you are on 0% charge. But it charges very fast to 85%. So, if you start charging it from 40%, it will take around 30-45 minutes to get fully charged.

6. Phone does not get hot under any circumstances, does not hand, does not restart.

7. Phone display is very bright, even in bright sunlight.

8. Phone UI is good, with some bloatware like NETFLIX.

9. Headphone is not given with phone.

I bought the mobile in the first day of its release and writing this review after almost 3 months.
For a normal user without gaming and all..,

Pros:

1.  Good battery backup
2.  Good display and hence we can watch movies and series also in this.

Cons:
1. Very dangeruos to use without screen guard or case. Display got broke on the second day and when I went to Samsung service centre.., they said the charge for changing display is Rs. 5500. which is very costly.

2.  Cant use it in one hand and the sensitivity is so high that even before pressing BACK button.., when typing something automatically that gets executed and it goes to a different screen. We get irritated all the time that happens
3. Face unlock is not up to the mark.

In a sentence, I am not a satisfied customer because of the above issues.

Excellent product. Worth buying it.

Pros:
Massive 6k battery. Goes on and on.
4 rear cameras with the main one at 64mp.
Excellent front cam.
Blue color looks stunning.
S amoled screen with always on display.
Finger print and face unlock work superb.
Android 10.

Cons:
Limited bloatware, Samsung apps, which can be disabled at least which is good.
Back panel absorbs fingerprints easily. Needs frequent cleaning.
Doesn't come with an earphone. You can buy one outside per your choice.

Suggestions:
Buy a back case and tempered glass for extra safety, though it has gorilla glass.

6+128 is priced 1k extra. I think 6+64 is quite enough and you can buy another 64gb memory card within 650-700 rs, so saving a little and increasing more data mobility.

Never look at M30 or M30s. You get M31 for the same price with much better camera.

A complete mega Monster.  This phone brings back Samsung in competition with the Chinese brands which has captured the market share in recent years.

Before writing this review, let me tell you'll a short brief on my requirements and background. I'm middleaged,  working professional from Mumbai and my requirements were basic usage with some multimedia at the EOD. And I'm not a gamer. This is my 3rd mobile in 4 years and prior to this,  I've been using A popular known brand and model,  Redmi Note 4 since 2017 and another from upcoming company Realme with it's launch model Realme1 since Jun 2018. And my very first Android phone was none other than Samsung Galaxy M (CDMA model) So my experience and expectations were coming from the usage of these 2 recent handsets.
I wanted a mobile which gives me a smooth touch experience (lagging in Realme 1) with a decent performance with best battery (lagging in RN4) and a large storage within a budget of 15k.
This mobile may not be the best for full time gamers however it can definitely help you get a good 2 days battery life (with all day usage with bluetooth connected) with a smooth and vibrant looking display with its super amoled screen and knocking performance for all day to day needs including some gaming.  And I'm completely satisfied with Samsung Galaxy M31 for this. With its new OneUI 2.0, I'm completely amazed with the kind of adaptations Samsung has done from its earlier Galaxy series.

I use to always feel, Samsung is am expensive brand and it always offer less against what we pay, however, must say, Samsung changed my perception towards Samsung mobiles. If your planning to upgrade for a smooth all around performance with a huge battery and a sexy display with a budget around 15-16k, go for it and you will love owing it...

after 6 days of use:
Camera 5/5
Performance 5/5
Display 5/5
Battery 5/5
Phone look 5/5
User interface 5/5
Sound 5/5
awesome phone
Pros:
1. It looks stunning with the AMOLED display and looks like a high-end category phone.
2. The battery is so powerful. literally a mini power bank. once fully charged it lasts for more than 2 days with heavy usage .
3. Fast charging. and the phone is very handy with lightweight. never expected the phone to be this much light with a huge 6000 Miah battery.
4. The camera is awesome. didn't expect a good camera and a mini power bank at this price range. wide-angle shots are as awesome as high-end phones.
5 , Touch Response  ‚Äì Fast, precise, with low latency. Particularly noticeable on the keyboard, quick toggle menu, as well as when knocking off notifications or deleting feeds on say, the Chrome browser. Faster animations further this experience.
6, Good call quality and Cellular Reception.
 value for money at this price .

Everything is better than expected. Just one thing can't resolve: JioCall app doesn't work. Though jio internet works, calls also are ok. Only app itself is not ok. I tried to check sim setting, mobile data settings, to restart the phone, everything - but nothing helps. Maybe there's no need of this app actually as soon as everything works without so it's ok.

This phone is the best phone which we can buy currently especially when this is coming from a brand like Samsung

1. The first thing is the screen which is very crisp and clear. Love watching movies on it.

2. The processor is fast and one of the best in this price range.

3. The battery which is 6000 mah even with a heavy phone usage will easily last you through the day and even more.

4. The finger print reader works well.

5. The camera is really good with great output all around.

All in all, it ticks all the right boxes and you are guaranteed to enjoy this phone. A very easy recommendation for all.

Awesome phone..I am writing  this review after using  the phone after more than 1 month. Both rear  and front camera is awesome  and quality of picture is good..it suport 4K videos..I am bit disappointed  on battery quality and charging ponit..It is not up to the mark on 6000mAh battery..It takes 3-4 hr to charge the full battery  and discharge within a day.If you will play game,it will discharge withi  10 hr.I am not playing games much,so I am satified but I won't support to buy this phone if you paly games all most of the time in a day.Also I am not happpy  on face recognition..I feel as It doesn't  support sometime..But overall it is a good phone.

Im writing this review after using it 20 days.

 I have received my phone on 8th March ,ordered on 5th march when the sell has started.
when I took this in my hand ,feel very light weight if comparision to 6000mah mega battery, I watched a movie of 2hour and 5 mins and it consumed only 20% battery ,battery life is very great ,it runs approx 1 to 1and half day after full charge. Charging time is approx 140 minutes.

Its camera quality is outstanding , night mode is also hats off, macro camera is so pretty if compare to other brands,It is completely one handed phone. so many features are available in this phone.
It has a very very very smooth processor. Now if talking about display that what a display is it. M31 has Curved display like which is given on samsung S8, S9 OR S10. It feels like premium display, Dark mode is outstanding..I always use dark mode.
Rear fingerprint is also working properly. It has a great quad camera set up. Worth for money...

Not worth it when you compare it with Xiaomi phones

Issues

--Heavier than MI phones
--Screenshot is not by scrolling  3 fingers as in MI phones. You need to press power button and volume button simultaneously
--screen mirroring is very poor does not works
-- Camera is also poor than MI phones
-- while opening web link gives only one option to open using Samsung Browser.
-- many other usability issues.
--overall you will feel going back to MI due to issues in usability

Samsung rolled out a beauty in the under 20k price range in m31. A completely all round phone which feels good in hand and runs smooth
Battery: 5/5 6000mah, what else do you expect
Screen: 6/5 SAmoled has my heart and soul and I dare you to find a better screen.
Design: 3.5 A little too thick but I guess it's compromisable given the battery is huge. Also the body could be metal or glass but since looks are subjective this phone looks pretty decent
Camera: 4.5/5 A beautiful camera system which works like a charm in daylight as well as night. To some the pictures may appear grainy but that's because of the resolution and efficiency of the screen itself. -.5 due to the limitations on the 64mp cam
Processor:4/5 Exynos run systems never compare to their Snapdragon equivalents but 9611 is pretty decent. After playing high Res games I couldn't see any lags or issues so in conclusion it's not as bad as it is made to sound.
OS: 4/5 the new OS by Samsung is definitely an improvement from their last few versions. But they definitely aren't stock android. Some preinstalled apps are definitely a pain but uninstalling takes matter of seconds. Plus Samsung's security system is A+ and keeps your device safe and also allows data transfer for faster recovery.

Brownie points for having a designated audio jack instead of the type c and also a designated fingerprint sensor over the in screen fingerprint sensor which are always slower.

The phone leaves barely anything to be asked except for maybe an ir blaster, although it may or may not be required by many it does come in handy at times.

Overall: 4.5/5 it's a two horse race for the under 20k segment between Samsungand realme. If you want a phone for general use and a battery powerhouse Samsung m31 seems to be the one.

Bad experience of a Samsung product even after years...
Hate the processor (Exynos 9611) as it doesn‚Äôt support quick performance or fast charging.

Just after a day of use got ghost screen touches problem and was hard to force restart...got solved automatically but lost my confidence.

Better processor, fast charging, glass build quality would have been better for the price.

Best Mobile for this price. Camera is par at the best. Both the front and rear cameras are excellent and the result is very detailed and very minute, previously was using Vivo V9 that to bought at Amazon. Low light photography is ok. Touch is excellent. Battery back up is also very good. Processing is very good without any lagging and no heating issues even at very very long usage, almost day long. Stylish and the curved edge screen is excellent

This phone has more than everything I expected. My favorite is this Super AMOLED screen just üòò.

Pros-
superb battery. 1- 1.5 day
Camera (Rear camera is on other level) + AR Emoji
6 GB Ram (more than my laptop)
Very nice call quality (I uses Airtel)
Finger print sensor is fast.
Selfie is better in natural lighting
Dedicated Memory card slot.
Charging speed is not that slow.
Feels very nice in hand and can be easily hold in one hand.

Cons-
Face unlock is slowww and few times didn't worked.
Can't uninstall Netflix, Facebook and few other Samsung's app but these can be disabled.
Got around 50 GB out of 64 GB.
No back cover provided in box.
Finger prints are all over the back.

Verdict

Best phone to buy around this budget. Super value for money. I am very happy to have this phone.
Don't think just buy it. You won't regret.

I've had the phone for 22days now. The finger print reader is fast, no inconsistencies at all. It's better than some indispaly print readers.
I like the screen, initially wanted the Galaxy A71 for its 6.7" screen, but once I had this delivered I realised a 6.4" screen was more than I needed.
The battery lasts for about 18hrs, after which I am left with about 24-28% charge (after heavy usage).
Which light usage  I have gotten well over 24hrs on a single charge.
One thing I can tell you though, is to slap a sturdy case on the phone immediately after purchase.

Samsung Galaxy M31 is the Perfect package out there. The Mega 6000mah battery easily gives me 2 days of battery backup. The 64mp camera gives amazing details in the photos. And the best part is, you can also take macro shots, not just with the macro lens, but with the help of 64MP camera too.
I was looking for few of things from my new phone. I wanted a great camera, great battery backup, unique and elegant looking design on the back of the phone. Samsung Galaxy M31 provides all of it. Plus a Super-AMOLED display. Samsung is THE best display manufacturer out there. The exynos chipset is no less than any other chipset in the market.
This phone has made me decide that my future phones will be of Samsung.

I have a Samsung M31
SYMPTOMS

a) all videos regardless of the application used are playing on fastforward with no sound. This happens on all apps incl youtube, netflix, amazon prime, including videos I have been sent via WhatsApp. b) there is no sound on the phone at all - nothing when I play music, it doesn't ring when someone calls me, and even though i can pick up the call, I can't hear the other person's voice and they cant hear mine

 ATTEMPTED FIXES THAT DID NOT WORK
1. Restart multiple times
2. Reset app preferences
3. Play with Dolby settings (restore to default, turn off/on)
4. Wipe cache preferences using volume up/down buttons then rebooting
5. Adjusting all the volume settings to make sure nothing was muted
6. Turn phone on on safe mode to ensure it wasnt the apps that were buggy (and played a video I had stored on my phone but same issue)

This is my first Samsung phone after a very long gap. It has got simple and minimal design that looks good. Speed is good and phone works smoothly.

However, within days of purchase I am finding that UI is functioning erratically sometimes. Certain apps may not start and phone is getting hanged. Sometimes it goes to some kind of sleep mode and after that it takes ages to be revived, sometimes even have to restart.

Sorry Samsung. I am disappointed.

Samsung Mobile Company is the best Mobile Company Because I buy Samsung Mobile.
Model No M31. This mobile is Samsung Galaxy M31. It is very best product when I bought this mobile that time many people bought this phone.

This is very good brand excellent camera result. Multiple functions to give photo different effects. Good Battery 6,000mAh battery and 15W Fast Charging timing. Interesting thing mobile not get held even we store multiple apps. Its rate is very economical every person easily affords it.

Samsung Galaxy M31 Mobile is versatile 64MP Quad camera to document your life and Immersive viewing with 16.21cm (6.4") Infinity-U Display with 64MP Ultra-High Resolution ISOCELL Bright GW1 image sensor. This is Excellent Feature With Fast Face Unlock and a Finger Print Sensor Now unlock your phone instantly with your face or fingerprint.
Good storage capacity. In these mobile features is 6GB Ram so this phone never be hang in any time and in this mobile Internal Storage is 62GB and add in memory.

So in my review I'm all the way supporting mobile and their functions and programs and the interesting thing is that is now a day‚Äôs mobile or cell phones or water protected in situation of wet or emergency by nature, however cell phone is very useful and super important for each and everyone, through cell phone you can call or message anyone within seconds, so I hope and I wish that in future I'll receive and see later the new innovations.

Guys don't become a fool and buy this phone
The phone will start hanging and will switch off in between a call. Touch will not work , you have to end up pressing the touch multiple times to accept end calls or to do any work on phone.
Battery life is ok ok
Phones started hanging in just 2 days
And more painful is that Amazon does not have return policy for this. They will send some technician to check it and "if " he finds issue phone will be replaced.
If I would have known this I would never have purchased it from here.
Now only god knows how my problem will be solved. I have came across such issue 1st time ever as I always preferred to buy such electronic items from physical store or not to go for any random low budget phone to avoid any complexity.

Rethink before buying this phone from amazon ( if u faced any difficulty they won't return or refund the amount)

Very Good Features. You just can't compare with 2 yrs back Samsung mid range smartphones.  they were really not value for money. but now situation is different.  the screen is really superb. everything is good except face lock. and the best part is it's a very trustable brand. nowadays privacy is the biggest concern and after hearing about the Xiaomi's case i am not gonna trust any chinese brand. i have poco f1 too but now the situation is different and i will not trust any chinese brand again. It's a promise

Overall it's good. But there features which are different from what I expected.
The charger is not that slow. It's good enough.
The battery doesn't last that long as I expected. Its above average.
The position is of earphone jack is at the bottom, which is not convenient for me personally. Especially during video calls, it better to have at the top.
The RAM is 6GB but 2-3gb is pre occupied. So I suggest only go for 6GB RAM.
The loud speaker could be better in terms of quality as well as intensity of loudness.

Overall it's a very good phone.

I am updating my old review because Samsung has provided excellent service via email to troubleshoot my galaxy M31 download struck issue, the mobile is performed well as of now, it is an excellent mobile because I am surprised when others are provided good feedback on my video call, the pics are also awesome, I have taken my little daughter's pic which was my favourite photo ever with this awesome Galaxy M31 mobile.
If you want to know about my previous problem here it is, but Samsung solved it remotely without visiting the service center.:

Galaxy M31 stuck at 'Downloading...Do not turn off target', ODIN MODE (AVB Fail)
SUPER: Build-id does not match with the reference
(SUPER) : 30278215R, (BOOTLOADER) : 29256088
I have tried to restart using Volume down+power button then samsung logo comes and then immediately it shows Downloading... blue screen. Tried many times but no use at all, My daily work is purely depending on this mobile but due to this problem I cannot use this mobile at all now, this will make my days too dangerous about my job during this corona lock down,  so contacted  samsungchat assistant but they suggested to visit the service center, but due corona lock down no service center available, I do not understand why should I visit the service center because it is a software problem not the hardware problem, I have tried to search the issue in Google it seems most of the Galaxy M31 mobiles facing the same issue, so I suggest samsung people should look into this issue ASAP and resolve it automatically without visiting the service centre by force update some thing

Pros
1)Good day light photos
2)Long battery backup
3)AMOLED Display
4)Samsung UI

Cons
1)Camera clarity lacks in indoor &amp; night
2)Charging time is more because of 6000mAh battery only with 15W charger.
3)Polycarbonate body.

This is hands down the best smartphone available in the market at this price range. It performs great in almost every department.
Cameras(both front and rear) are amazing. Clicks amazing detailed shots.
Battery(6000 mah) is outrageous. Lasts for a day(heavy usage) or two(normal usage) easily.
UI(one UI 2.0) is fantastic. Smooth and buttery experience.
Display(Super Amoled FHD+)is gorgeous. Viewing angles are fantastic and color reproduction is amazing.
Processor(Exynos 9611) is quite powerful. While it is not a gaming centered phone it performs above average in all high end games.
Considering to but a smartphone with the best value for money? Then this is the best pick!

After using an iphone this phone feels quite low in performance. The screen resolution is not sharp, the camera has filters but images are not sharp. A bit slow response to certain apps.
Otherwise good with fingerprint response, battery life is amazing overall for the price it's good for general use.

OMG!!!
Fabulous one!
I just love this one. Samsung just has brought a best phone for us under 20k.
Since, I've been using this product, I found it better than any other phone in market. The most impressive  thing I find is it's UI, battery, camera and smooth screen(higher refresh rates). It's camera is really fabulous one. The battery of this phone do never let you down from using. It's UI is too user friendly. I found it best in every aspect. It's terrible combination of it's price and features makes me mad. Guys, I solemnly recommend you to have purchase of this product.thanks!
Hopefully, I think you find this review helpful.

One of the best satisfying phone I ever had in my life. After 7 days of use I find that the phone has a longer battery storage keeps long lasting , camera,  videos  and functions like hyperlapse,  slow motion mode,  superslowmotion mode is commendable to use. Display is big enough with curve design, looks are fantastic.  Eye catching masterpiece. Speakers are good ..faster enough..
Go for it people

Pros:
6GB RAM,64MP rear camera,32MP Front Camera,6000mah battery and more over Samsung is brand,Gorilla glass 3,Sound is good especially DOLBY ATMOS,AMOLED Display
Cons:
Some what delay in recognizing face especially in low light conditions, Back Panel build with Plastic
And remaining is good And you have to buy ear phones and case and Temper glass/Screen Protector.I am using phone since five days I didn't face any problems and more over that this phone will have some lags while playing pubg.So game lovers didn't like this phone I mean you will play up to medium level games but large exams like PUBG..etc you will face some lags.But except game lovers every common man like this phone and it fulfills all his needs.

Now firstly for the pubg lovers I would like to tell you that it easily runs pubg at HDR ultra settings of graphics with no lag you just need to activate performance mode which obviously uses more battery give best performance.The phone has three battery modes by default it will be in performance mode ,( takes as much juice possible from your battery to handle your heavy tasks, multitasking, etc. And once you it last easily 2 days. Cameras are awesome it's a bit warmer and soft images but details are amazing and other colours.....
Guys literally there are loads of features and don't want to write an essay over here it will be tedious for you all to read....
Trust me I'm using it as my daily driver and had no issues ya it may not have 90Hzs but who needs it in day to day budget life. Don't think just go for it and you enjoy it phone ...... #bestbudgetphone...

Like's
1. Ergonomic design
2. Less SAR value
3. No over heat issue
4. Battery lasts minimum 2 days &amp; max 3 days
5. AMOLED Display is awesome at its best
6. Feels light and easy to hold

Dislike's
1. Plastic build is prone to easy scratches
2. Not packed with company fitted screen protector for its price
3. No TPU back cover available with the box
4. 15 watt charger is not sufficeant to charge large 6000 mah battery fast

Over all:
A value for money smartphone with lot to like, compromises are acceptable for this price range.....Go for it without 2nd thought if your budget is strictly around 17k

Finger print sensor is really good.Phone just unlocks within milliseconds. Battery life is also good an average phone user can use the phone for 2 days once if it is charged with 100%.camera quality is good.I liked the UI and functionality of the OS very much.I already used samsung A30 which is quite slow compared to m31.I found that M series is quite faster in terms of response .I liked the new features like multi language typing etc...Overall this product is price worthy.

Honestly this is my best mobile purchase ever. I'm completely satisfied with all the aspects of the mobile.
Especially battery !!! Easily lasts a whole even with extensive usage.
Quad Camera set up is just awesome üëå
Amazing sound clarity as well both from earphone input and from speakers.
What I particularly liked is the hassle free One UI which gives a buttery and effortless mobile  experience.
Front camera is decent enough for a selfie.
Overall, this is an excellent mobile purchase for me.

Pro:Phone Display is impressive 5 out of 5, Battery life impressive 5/5, Phone weight management excellent 5/5, Speaker output is Normal.
Cons: Front camera detailing need to improvement rating 3/5, Back Camera detailing need to improvement rating 3/5, I'm Facing Performance issue phone hang issue without any gaming (I'm just a normal user i'm not a gamer or heavy user ) during YouTube surfing , There is no option for apps lock for privacy related, Phone build quality need to improve volume up down &amp; power button very poor quality its to hard.
Suggestion: Samsung can fix most of the things with help of software update, specially camera detailing issue.

Product is very good. This mobile phone has best battery backup. Anyone can think 6000 mah battery with 64 mp rear back camera and 32 mp front camera. The fingerprint is responding so fast. Fack lock is outstanding. Security level is very good. This mobile phone has mamy more features like- screenshot with hand. Screen display is very smooth with gorilla glass. The Samsung prosser of this phone is best for gaming. The ram is very good and rom also. This phone also produces just small amount of radiation compare to other phone. I think this mobile can beat I phone also and at last I recommend this phone to that who want  mobile phone working for 2 or 3 year. I really....... Like this phone Samsung. Your company is best for me.

The first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31 is its design. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is good. The battery 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support, 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with an AMOLED screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels and Samsung Exynos 9611 processor, are some excellent feature of the Samsung Galaxy M31 Smartphone, which no other competitor is offering right now at this price point.
after 7 days of uses:
Phone design &amp; look - 5/5
Camera  - 5/5
Performances  -5/5
Display  - 5/5
Battery  -5/5
User interface  -5/5
Sound  -5/5
awesome phone

Great display for the price range and I am happy that I shifted to Samsung for this reason.
Battery life is good and lasts for almost 2 days with normal usage with WiFi, but it's not the best as it drains quickly with 4G.
Camera is decent when it's outdoor. At low light and indoors it's just an average camera. Live focus selfies and night mode(front and rear)are useless. Live focus / portrait blurs out some portion of the face which is very bad.
Call quality and speaker quality is fine.
Samsung One UI is good but it misses out some of the important features as it's M series phone.

Review after 4 days usage:

The phone is very good in terms of what it offers for 16 thousand mid range segment. Pros,cons and final verdict below.

Pros:
1. Camera is solid. Far better then any other mobiles in this segment. Live focus,slow motion and other features work perfectly. Have attached live focus,normal pick, normal video and slowmo. If you want great camera performance this is the mobile
2. Battery is wonderful, no need to tell it's a beast 6000 Mah
3. Display is crisp and very sensitive
4. Game play is also great, pubg works well in normal graphics
5. Build is also very good, not as bad as they are reviewed it's a decent build for this segment but not much smudge proof. Use back cover.

Cons:
1. Slow charging due to 15w but this is not a problem as 1 time charge will last you while day
2. Some times the apps icons on up swipe do not display, once locked and unlocked it reappears not much of an issue must be software or due to heavy graphics wall papers. Will check further and update.

Final verdict is to go for the mobile if you are keen on camera, display and battery. For game play pubg note 8 pro might perform well in graphics side but this does a decent job as well. It worth it guys, its actually a mega monster #megamonster #sansung

First of all , I would say the phone has extremely good battery life while using continuously (Gaming Netflix) it delivers upto 13-14 hrs backup

Fingerprint reader is very fast, phone gets unlocked with just a touch

Camera quality is also very good in daylight and in low light it is satisfactory

I didn't face any lag while playing PUB-G , the phone did a great job.

 I also loved the Super amoled display, it delivers a very good quality viewing experience.

Overall the phone is doing a great Job, I didn't face any problems as of now loved it :)

This product is very smoothly working for me. Very smooth to touch and hold. The display is very sharp. Finger print reader read very efficiently. Camera, both front and rear, wide and telephoto are of superb quality. Battery capacity is same like a 4000mAh phone I had earlier, I am satisfied with the battery, but may have last little longer as it is 6000mAh.
Finally, the phone is sturdy enough to sustain from major injury, even after accidental fall from 3rd floor.

Hi all samsung fans,

Galaxy M31 is wonderful phone overall. The main pros of this phone is camera and display. I  should say about the one UI also, its a wonderful work by Samsung. Lots of customization is available in One UI. Quad cam is awesome. For pubg I can play in high refresh rate and UHD graphics.

Their are few drawbacks too...
6000 Mah battery doesn't show the perfomance as it says, but its decent...
Phone has a slight heat issue, only on heavy usage.

Overall Samsung Galaxy M31 is a supercool phone that you can have in this price rage.

Note to samsung:
1. Please add secure folder in next update.
2. Provide a built in app lock.

This fingerprint reader is faster then my last mobile, and much more fast then in screen fingerpring.
The camara quality is good, and took nice portrait shorts.(here I uploaded some pics for m31)
And I really like the display and build, although I had 6000 may battery weight distribution is even

Really enjoying 6000mah battery, it gets more then 1 day of Battery life and 10Hrs of ScreenOn time,
Even flagships like S20,note 10, OnePlus, iPhone doesn't get this battery life (they get around 5-7hrs approx)
If it gets a fast charger in the box it could be much more easy to charge massive battry

If u are not a power user or a heavy gamer, this is a perfect buy
Mainly elders dont use heavy apps or games, if they use it in battery saver mode, it can easily get 2 days of battery life for them.

Note**
One of the Main reason to buy is Samsung security feature, if Ur cell is lost you track it with Samsung website immediately (if net is on), and "NOBODY CAN SWITCH OFF" your mobile unit they have Ur Password or pattern

I think this review helpful
Thank you.......

I use my phone for almost around 18 hrs in 24hrs!! I don't know if the heating issue is due to that or not. But its getting heated up after using it for few mins. If you have your phone idle for sometime it cools down but then the instant you start to use it, it gets heated up. Can't have it over ear to speak on a call.

PERFORMANCE : 4 stars
CAMERA : 5 stars, too cool!!! Jus as promised!!
BATTERY: 3 stars, cuz once its below 30, it starts to drain too quickly.
SPEAKER: When playing COD/PUBG in landscape mode, the fingers goes over speaker and restricts the audio... Which is really annoying. If you switch to the other way, the notch takes up space and hides game controls like firing button.
AUDIO JACK : Could've been on top. Being in bottom is so annoying that i couldn't place my phone over ground while on vid call.
SCREEN CAST : Works perfectly. I tried with my Mi smart tv and its cool.

Everything else is fine.
Would be perfect if heating issue is fixed.

My previous phone had a cracked LCD and was on the lookout for a new phone. Thanks to the lockdown, had lots of time on my hand to review most phones, get firsthand accounts from friends and then make a choice.
To be honest, my first preference was the OP8 and was looking for video reviews when I stumbled upon this phone. Samsung seems to have packaged a decent bit of hardware and specifications on this phone which gets most of your job done.
Disclaimer: If you are an avid gamer, then this is not for you unless you are ready to make trade offs
What I Like the most:
1. Comes with Android one UI v2. The phone has a near bloat free experience and very close to stock android. However, some of the features are masked by Samsung, I'm if those will be available in higher end or flagship models like S20 / S20 Note etc. However, loving the features like Dark mode, use Camera flash for notification, ability to capture more than one face etc.
2. Amazing display, the AmOLED display is a pleasure to view and even can be used under direct sunlight.
3. The phone comes with support for two sims and SD card, which is good for avid music lovers like me to stash and carry my ever-growing collection of music &amp; videos.
4. Samsung switch App, for once I have a product from Samsung which does the job without any fuzz. Was able to transfer my data from my broken phone using this.
5. The Camera is of decent quality, so far, the pictures have turned out well, but still exploring so will reserve my comments for now.
What I don‚Äôt like
1. 6000 MAH battery adds to the weight but gives the same performance as my old phone 4000 MAH battery. Could have tweaked battery usage
2. The build is dated, and the naked phone may not draw any oohs &amp; aahs from onlookers. Plastic body is prone to scratches and fingerprints, so better invest in a case.
3. No headphones provided by Samsung, not sure if this is the trend, but a simple 100 Rs earphone could have enhanced the VFM perspective.
4. Lastly the Exynos processor, so far, I‚Äôve not notices any lag or slowness, but at times I feel that the phone is a tad unresponsive especially when I try to pull down the notification panel or try to dismiss a few apps.
Overall Verdict:
It‚Äôs a bargain buy with good specifications, recommend purchasing this.

Nice (probably the best) phone at this price range.
Here is my take (rating based on 5 stars)on the specs:
Looks and feel - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚≠ê
Processor - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê I still think Snapdragon 8** is better
Video - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Sound - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Battery life - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Charging - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Connectivity - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê video call experience is great with Vodafone 4g
Camera - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê best feature of the phone, wide angle lens is too good

Bottomline: I would definitely recommend this phone

Honestly didn't expect this phone to be soo good. The software animations are so fluid, the camera is crazy good and the screen is obviously best in the market coz. Its Samsung's. I'm listing some pros and cons down here, be sure to read it. Also I've posted photos shot on this phone for reference.

Pros:
‚Ä¢Samsung's one UI is way better than the competition like Redmi's crappy MIUI.
‚Ä¢The camera's are just too good, the HDR shots are amazing and the 64mp rear and 32mp front camera modes are just the cherry on top.
‚Ä¢6000 mah battery is absolute overkill for a phone at this price.
‚Ä¢The screen is really good, it's Amoled and can get pretty bright outdoors and pretty dim for indoors too.
‚Ä¢The processor is really good too, enough for any task u throw on this.
‚Ä¢Fingerprint scanner is on the back instead of in the screen thus it's faster, more reliable and better.
‚Ä¢Amazon delivered the phone in 24 hrs with exchange so it was amazing.

Cons. :
‚Ä¢No fastcharger in the box even when it supports it, so charging to 100% takes too long.
‚Ä¢In wide angle camera, there's no lens correction like in Samsung's Hughes end phones so photos look weird at the corners(I've uploaded a wide angle photo for reference).
‚Ä¢phone can get a little bit hot while gaming, but not crazy hot so it's fine.
‚Ä¢The 64mp photos are not that crisp so I just stick to normal camera mode.

.I have been using this Samsung Galaxy M31 for 3 months now.
Here is what I like about this phone-
I am quite satisfied with it's 48 MP Triple Camera that delivers quite beautiful picture quality, Other than that I am happy with the long lasting battery, fast charging, smooth touch response and the clarity of super amoled display. Other good thing about the phone is that it does not heat up even after a long time of game play both online and offline.
But ...
I am not satisfied with the functioning problem of the phone that quite an often the phone hangs when I am typing something and some other times it get re-started on its own.
&amp; apart from its functioning it does not come with free customisation of themes and icons as everything is paid.

Overall Phone is good.

I have been using it for last 3days. All things are good  but it is taking more than 4hrs for charging. I don't know whether it's a defective one or is the  characteristic of Samsung m31. Whatever  but more than 4hrs of charging time is unacceptable.  I am observing it for another day if it goes like this than I will return it.

After day 5 of my use;
 it is doing well. It's charging within 3hrs, though it's not fast charging but ok for me. The day 1 sluggish charging may be due to first time charging of the phone in use. Now it is performing well. If you want a phone with good battery back up and best screen quality then you can go for it.

Display is fabulous as it is Super Amoled display, no pointing discussing about it. Now fingerprintscanner is pretty hippy, so full Mark's. BEST part is the battery last almost two days plus for me, I am not a gamer but social media bug, watch Prime YouTube and More.
With all this I am not going with exynos processors capability as I have not put it to test.
CAMERA is good but what disappoints is 64MP setting is only in 4:3 not fullscreen and Pro version has no aperture and shutter control, my wife's one and half year old Huawei mobile has that, seriously Samsung if I r going to compete with Redmi note 9  and realme 6 I got to up the ante a bit more ...

Please don't buy this phone. It has major heating issues. It gets drastically heated while watching videos, while taking photos, during calls and also while charging. 6000mah battery is just for name sake. It works for 1 to 1.25 days without heavy usage. Full charging takes upto 3hrs. Speaker quality is also bad.
The only good thing about this phone is camera.

Worst phone ever I bought. I ordered the phone in 1st day of lunch. I got timely delivery but  After using for 29 days phone got hang up while updating software. Now phone is locked for more than 2days in a screen showing AVB error . I tried to restart phone many time but still showing same . Even I let the phone to get switch off by itself after consumption of battery still showing same while charging.Now I can't return it because they say return period were till 27th march. Lockdown nation wide still on can't go to Samsung care centre. I'm giving those stars because I don't have any option for zero.I don't understand what should I do.

I haven't come across such a great camera at this cost. Battery is just keep going until you get off...optimal size &amp; screen details are amazing..over all, ...fingerprint sencer at back &amp; follow your commands instantly without any glitch  ..never ending battery I experienced..using it for more than month now...it's get on well with me...screen size is nothing but perfect what I looking for &amp; the phone is much convenient in holding it ...no second thought if you desperately need a phone ...a complete package to complete a man!!!!!

Excellent phone with all the necessary specs for a fantastic deal. I bought this at 14999. At that price I needed 4 things:
a) Good processing power and RAM
b) Sufficient internal memory &amp; expansion
c) Good battery
d) Good camera

I'm very happy with the first 2. I have a 128GB card which houses all my data and hence,
64GB was more than enough for me. Battery doesn't feel like a 6000mAh. My charge runs down to 30% by the end of the day. But this might be because of extensive initial setup. This is why I'd give it less than 5 stars. Another problem is the call-speaker volume is not great.
The camera is mostly good and sufficient for candid photography. The sensor is what matters and it is good enough for this price point.
Some of the built-in features are good.
In short, I'm happy with my purchase.

I am not sure what but I feel something is missing. The finger print sensor is not good. Sometimes it does not read finger print and we have to enter the pass code or pattern. Camera and battery is good. For medium usage it gives backup for almost two full days. With 2 hours of browsing Facebook and other websites, and about 2 hours of calls...using Bluetooth almost 7-8 hours a day. Battery still lasts for almost full 2 days.

I upgraded from a 4 year old samsung. So as soon as I got hands on experience with this phone, I was amazed by how smooth the experience was.

Samsung has moved onto the budget phone market and has established an elegant line of phones.

Pros:
 - The finger print sensor is fast and very responsive
 - The battery lasts a good 2 days.
 - Faster compared to other budget phones in the 15k~ range
 - The build quality is nice
 - Despite the size, it's a very light phone

Cons:
 - Battery takes 3 hours to charge completely
 - Even though it has a nice back, it is prone to fingerprints, and scratches
 - Thicker than normal

Screen quality is out of the box.Sound quality is out of the park.But performance is not up to the mark.Samsung exynos processor is a good one but the way it handles the apps to open is worst.Camera quality is pretty.Battery life is a monk.Don't buy this one if you are not a person with lot of patience.Because it lags here and there.

Overall rating:2.5/5
Phone number :6303862324
I am trying from the past 5 days to return it but amazon page is showing error.I beg any one to call me for help .Please I am a student who bought with my scholarship money for practicing online exams,but it is not up to the mark

This phone is bizzare.
PROS
Processor is fine.
Design feels solid and the phone is good to hold in hand.
The UI is also quite good.
The camera is 64mp and won't fail you.
The selfie camera is 32mp and is pretty good.
Pubg does not lag and runs smoothly.
The sAMOLED display is the highlight of the phone.
CONS
The phone has bloatware.
The finger sensor is on the back. I would have preferred an onscreen one or on the power button in this price range.
The phone is thicker than the A series.
I am not a fan of notch and would have preferred a punch hole instead.

There are several pros for M31. But since it's already covered by other reviewers and YouTube videos, I'll instead point out some not-so-common cons (if at all you can call them cons!)

1. The phone does not come with a backcover and it is a fingerprint magnet. So you would need to buy a backcover for aesthetics.

2. Not water resistant (is that asking too much?üòÖ)

3. It does take a bit of time to get fully charged. But once that's done, it'll easily last for more than a day.

4. The earphone slot is at the bottom of the phone. I personally like it on the top. Again, it wouldn't be a bother if you use a Bluetooth earphone/headset. :)

5. This might not be the phone for heavy gamers.

I haven't found any other problem after a month's usage.
Overall, I totally recommend this phone. üòä

P.S - I saw some reviews saying the camera quality is poor. I disagree to it as I feel it's really good.

Phone is good. Value for money, but sound quality is not good. While playing Facebook,Youtube and other MX Player or internal video's it's not getting sound. If I restart then phone then its sounding. I'm facing oftenly but it's not resolved yet. And Wifi hotspot is not working properly while connecting to desktop or Laptop. But its connecting to mobiles. I raised for exchange phone, let's see what will happen. But I never expects this type of problems by SAMSUNG. Really upset....!!

Best phone in cool price. You get top mobile brand Samsung‚Äôs phone in this price which is amazing. People just see configuration of Chinese brands but they don‚Äôt see software and security features needed in phone. Samsung‚Äôs one Ui is best UI experience with trust of Samsung. Phone‚Äôs working  is super smooth, amazingly light even though it has 6000 mah battery and camera quality is top class. I preferred it over iPhone SE as this has better look new design.

I got it on Saturday morning. You will get a mobile and charge. Which is OK. No phone cover, no earphone, no screen glass.
Everything is fine now coming on the battery part.
6000mh honestly??? I charged it 100 percent in the night and today in the evening It was 56 and I didn't used it a lot. But I think it is okay in this price range ... I don't play games but if you are a games lovers. You need to think it twice.
 battery part is a questionable thing.
Face lock doesn't work properly. Sometimes it recognizes your face and sometimes it doesn't

This phone is really a Mega monster

Pros:
- Android 10 (very fast and feels light while operating)
- Stunning Display with Blue light filter (i always use th filter )
- 4K video recording  UHD video 3840x2160.
- 6 GB Ram enough to play most of the games
- 6000 Mah battery is enough to get you through the day
- Storage 128 GB (If you record 4k videos you need to get a memory card )
- Fast charging with 15W brick (could have been faster but OK)
- Mobile speakers sound is OK ( but not loud enough)
- Camera is really good with 64 mp back and 32mp front
- figure-print sensor response is ok ( with sweaty hands you have to struggle)

Cons:
- Recording video with flash on the phone over heated and restarted with a message "your phone is over heating" (if thats a feature form Android 10 its okey to save the hardware)
- you cannot zoom in or out in most camera modes (hope those can be fixed with an update)
- no gestures to bring torch without unlocking phone (my previous phone has a dedicated music key which i assigned to torch)

Feedback

A well built phone with good features
I am happy I bought this phone :)

This is my first Samsung mobile i ever buy and worse product I ever buy. Plz don't be mislead by 64mp quad cameras and 6000amh battery. Fast charging literally doesn't work it took almost 2hours to get 100% charge with 15w charger . Front camera is worse camera but with update it get little better. we can't turn on flast while wide angle photo It is not even week since I bought , suddenly screen touch stop working , can't restart or do anything on it . Lying useless at moment . Shame on you Samsung .

I purchased this device on the very first day of it release, I purchased it for my Dad as he wanted a device which is simple enough to use with enough battery for everyday use and good camera to take pictures.
He is not a gamer nor he is a power user , thus looking at the criteria which he needed this phone was making all right ticks .
My dad is extremely happy with his purchase although when I have used the phone to just see how it is , I feel there are some software issues for example sometimes he says face unlock works sometimes it doesn't , which I believe is just a simple software fix .

On the next day of release i.e 6.3.2020 ,  I purchased Samsung M31 , as I was very impressed with M20.Samsung the " master in creating mobiles " in the intrest of public and to their taste.
  My order was honoured and sent the phone within 3days.Now Iam enjoying the great phone suitable to my purse.
No heating in playing and recording videos.Thrillig sound output ..What more I need..I recommend to my friends to own a beautiful phone..

The best thing about this phone is not its battery but the display. And the most acclaimed battery (and its charger) is a disappointment because it takes 3 hours to completely charge. Who has 3 hours to keep the phone for charging? Samsung should have provided a faster charger that could charge the phone in an hour and a half at the max, and a 15min dash to charge it 30 /35 percent. Apart from this the phone is great. Even now, Samsung can come up with a fast charger and people would buy it as per the recommendation instead of going for some other company charger which may damage the phone or its battery. Moreover the completely charged phone is good to go for one and half day for moderate use.

A little more details after a couple of months usage. This phone needs to be little more rugged as it can crack at edges and screen very easily. An aluminum/any metal body would be much better. The battery after 2hrs 20 mins charge can easily take you through the day with above moderate usage. For heavy users, still a fast charging option may be required at the end of day. I mean who keeps phone to charge for 2+ hours? You cannot risk charge it whole night too. Samsung has produced a nice phone. It could be a game changer with some more changes.

64mp camera is not that good. Its image orocessing for 64mp is bad. It is like drawed picture more or less when you zoom more. Its colours are not that real and it doesnt feel that good to take 64mp photo. Its battery is good but at the first charge it took ages for me to get 100 percent. But after that it got quicker i.e it got to its original speed of charge. Software and its ui looks premium and good. There is a little lag while you fast open recent apps ( You can see it rarely, but for some apps u see it for sure). But overall its good. You will see some features which are that useful to you but when you see it will feel good. I think samsung does it because it wants yo make us feel luxury( but luxury in the sense not that useful but it is there) and honestly it feels good to have it. You will feel it good, simple, elegant to have it in your hand.

I buyed phone on sale day 2 and received next day that , what I liked about the phone is battery Backup and Camera features rest things are pretty common like other competitors phone. Software is much better and impressive display in this segment.

Cons:
Volume is very low on call
Face recognition  could be improved
Lags and gets little heat up while heavy gamimg.
Fast charging is not fast may be because of bigger battery 6000mah

Amazing phone ever .I had been use the Samsung phone from 5 yrs and the Samsung m31 is amazing .it contains fast finger print sensor, fast charging.most of the people suggesting this phone and Samsung m31 beat my expectation because  it's really extraordinary. There is a more option in camera like background changes,food option ,slow moo...if you want to buy 64mp camera phone u will go for Samsung m31.6000mah battery,64 MP camera,32 mp front camera,fast finger print sensor,fast charging and with all this benefit the price is 16000 only thq Samsung for this awesome product

2. 15w charger is enough for 6000mah battery
3. Camera (both front and back) in low light is not up to the mark
4. There are few issue with software for example, sometimes unable to send SMS, Samsung customer took remote access but unable to find reason.
hope these software issues will be fixed soon with future updates

Over all - it is a value for money.

I was thinking of purchasing a  budget phone for a long time and i searched a lot and at last i ordered samsung galaxy m31. It is the best budget phone under 17k price range. It has a massive battery and it is enough for 1.5 day for a mild user. The games like lubg also run smooth. The camera is just fantastic. If u are looking for a  budget phone blindly go for it.

Good phone but BEWARE....
(1) The front facing does not look like it's 32 MP.
(2)The BATTERY is NOT NOT NOT good. It drains off in 12 hrs flat heavy use. But even if you use it with ease it doesnt seem to stretch to 24 hrs.
SAMSUNG's claims seem to be not correct about battery.

The camera and display are excellent.  I am absolutely fine using a regular fingerprint reader , as midrange indisplay fingerprint reader sucks in midrange samsung phones.
Battery life is decent,  you csn leave a lot of things turned on.
The phone takes a lot of time to boot up , not sure why.
Charging is pretty slow compared  other quick charging Samsung phones.

I was a Samsung C9pro user for past 3 years , the migration to M31 was pretty easy with smart switch, other than few credit card apps none of the  other apps recognise the move, face unlock it works and it doesn't, phone battery stays for one and half day with dual SIM,  figner print scanner improved a lot, camera is also better with correct light, phone casting to TV is not crashing , however  photo quality when we view on a 4k TV is not great, android auto also much stable, Bluetooth connectivity with both smart watch and car works seamlessly.

The best ever decision qas to purchase this budget Smart phone with extraordinary battery capacity.
I have never expected the amazing Performance of Samsung phones of this price range.
The performance of this phone is ultimate matching near to its S series phones.
Battery is awesome...its range for me is 18hrs in one charge.
Camera performance is out standing.
Fingerprint is instant.
Overall best offer by Samsung.
Thanks to Samsung for launching such a wonderful budget Smart phone.

After a months use I will highly recommend this phone to all heavy users. The camera and battery are two of the best pros to buy this mega monster. Screen is awesome and clearly visible in bright sunlight. One very important benefit is that when you connect the phone to computer for taking photos or files from your phone, its very easy to find the files or photos from phone memory, whereas its a nightmare to find your data on most of the Chinese brands. Its the best option out there, so dont try any other Chinese phones but buy Samsung Galaxy M31.

I really like the camera. The battery life was very good .It took me around 2 days to completely discharge the battery.The amoled screen was like cherry on the top of cake .They only complain I have is there is a minor lag in viewing the picture after taking a snap .It takes a pause of 2-3 sec which was bit unusual for me because  the phone performance was very good and  It is very fast . The other thing is there is no stabilization in macro mode and the night mode is pretty good  (it's  not very good ).Ignoring these minor defects  ...the phone is all in all very good .I'm satisfied  with it.The delivery by Amazon was fast and the phone was neatly  packed .

This phone is truly fantastic in this price range.
Am writing this review after using for a week.

Pros:

1. 6000 mah battery is really a monster.
2. Camera is excellent.
3. Touch sensitivity and fingerprint readers are very good

Cons:
1. Phone is hanging sometime while unlocking and sometimes while using apps. This might be due to software. I can this came be overcome through updates.
2. Observed little heat, after using it for 45 minutes audio call

Giving review after Using it for two days.  Recieved the phone with 49% charge and it lasted over 7 hours with continuous use. So yes the battery is massive.

Here are some pros, some average features and some cons I experienced in two days of rigorous usage.

Pros-

1. Superrrrr Battery-  Today I charged my phone to 100% and it's been more than 4 hours of continuous use and the battery is still 75%. The Monster battery of 6000mah Is by far the USP of Galaxy M31 and the reason why I bought this smartphone.

2. The Stunning and beautiful super Amoled Display- OMG I can't emphasize on how gorgeous the display is. After watching on this super amoled screen, every other display of laptop, TV, other phones look out dated.

3. One UI 2.0 - the UI of M31 is amazing. It is simple yet so satisfying. This is hands down the best UI in any smartphone.

Average features-
1. Gaming - I'm not a heavy or pro gamer but played pubg and Gareena free fire for a little while for testing. The games do take a little while to open thanks to dated exynos 9611 but there's no significant lag while playing and average players will have no issue playing Games in this smartphone. Not to mention the super amoled screen makes graphics look stunning.

2. Camera-  Both front and back camera in this smartphone are good but not 64mp or 32mp good. However The quality is amazing considering the Samsung brand name and budget price tag. On a positive note HD videos can be made in this smartphone so you can stop taking your DSLR everywhere.

3. Also has Dolby atmos feature. I did use it while using YT music but found no difference. Maybe it requires better quality headphones to experience or is just useless.

4. The phone does look good but fails to give premium look. Back panel is plastic instead of glass something redmi note 8 has. However I always use cover so not an issue for me.

5. 6 GB RAM - the Ram is 6 GB yet only 3 gb is ever free. Rest of the 3 gb is gobbled up by the heavy OS and bloatware.

6. McAfee antivirus - McAfee antivirus is preloaded but I have annual subscription of Avast ultimate so kind of useless to me.

Cons-
1. No cover provided within the box.
2. No headphones provided.
3. No Samsung secure folder.
4. Fingerprint scanner is a little bit higher. I'm currently having difficulty getting used to it.
5. The charging pin Is wider so can't use one charger for all purposes and can't use data cable with other smartphones.

Verdict- My biggest priority while buying a budget smartphone was a Massive battery, premium display, above average Camera, average gaming and samsung brand name. And Galaxy M31 doesn't disappoint at all.  It's a well spent money from my side. If your priorities are same as mine then go for it. üëç

Phone is very slow because of the custom OS of Samsung, press lock button and it takes half a second to lock the screen, gets hanged too, not worth the price. Battery takes long to charge. Compared to other smartphone in the same price range, it's not worth buying unless you want phone with long battery life and the brand name.

The Camera  performance though  boasts a 64 MP rear camera and 32MP selfie camera fall short of the quality of  pictures &amp; videos  when compared to my other mobile pictures which is  Realme Note 5pro &amp; has 48MP rear camera. I failed to understand how Samsung could fall short to Realme even when boasting higher  specs.  Not satisfied with M31

I got the delivery of the phone 2 days after its launch, so this review covers my experience of about 3 months-

1. Screen - The Display is superb to say the least. sAMOLED display makes watching videos a delight!
2. Camera - Few modes and video shooting in both rear and front camera is great. The enhancements dont make the photos look artificial which is great! However, can improve on the 64 MP mode - probably on OTA update can fix it.
3. Battery - I have used phones with 5000 mAH battery for the last 2-3 years from Asus (Max series) - If I would rank that 5/5 because they would easily last 1.5 days without charge, this would be 4 +0.5 /5 ( 0.5 for fast charging, even if battery drains out fast). A full charge can last the day.  This is when I have medium to heavy usage of phone without gaming.
4. Processing - Very smooth for 6GB, no lags whatsover!
5. Some modes and features -
‚Ä¢Dolby Atmos Sound mode for headsets is amazing!
‚Ä¢ Game mode has lots of features related to screen like screen recording, etc.
‚Ä¢ Fingerprint scanner is super fast too. Haven't tried the face unlock so can't comment on that.

Overall, would suggest that if you want to couple the brand trust along with good features - definitely go for M31 !

Monster phone! I have been using this for over a week now.
Pros
Very good camera
Amazing battery life
Beautiful screen quality
No lag
No heating
Calling clarity, signal reception and wifi is perfect.
Cons-
Could have given a non plastic back or at least a matte finish so that finger print smudging is avoided.

Loved the phone at such a price. Will be a monster killer for other budget phones.

I being looking out for a monster like this for some time now....
What I liked about the Phone
1. Aesthetic body is sturdy with simple design which gives business  look to phone
2. Camera 64 MP lens is quite awesome captures it without being pixellating and various features to choose from
3. AMOLED screen in this price is stunning
4. Touch is smooth
5. Color sharpeness and quality is video as good as high end phone
6. Space of 6GB +128 GB is sufficient and has minimum preloaded apps
7. Voice clarity is good use good earphone but better sound effect and clarity.

Overall u won't find a Made in India product with such a terrific features at competitive  prices..
This mobiles seems to be beginning of Aatmanirbhar mission

Excellent product by Samsung at this price point. Worth every penny you spend. 64mp camera is awesome, it really takes some stunning photos. SAmoled screen is crisp and clear. Battery performance for moderate usage for someone like me can work 2days.
I am using Redmi note 7 pro from last 1 year, but this is certainly best in terms of performance as compared to Mi phones.
Finger print reader is also fast. The SAR value of this phone is also very low (0.3) as compared to other high value phones. Without any doubts this is the best budget phone right now in the market.

The Samsung galaxy M31 is the best phone to buy under Rs.20.000 I purchased the samsung brand after gap of 2 years. The phone is worth buying for the following reasons.(after using for 3 days).
1.Camera quality.(both front and back camera are awesome)
2.Fingerpoint reader and face reader works very fast.
3.The 6000mah Monster battery works for two days easily even for heavy user
4.The super amoled screen in this price range is great.
I strongly recommend this phone to all the buyers.
Thank you SAMSUNG

Excellent  phone and very much satisfied with the features of the phone.  The camera is too good and battery life is awesome. This proven again as Samsung is best in its quality.  The camera inbuilt AI features are very helpful and easy to use.  Overall I taken the right decision choosing this phone and that too with so many features within the reasonable budget.  I do recommend to my friends to go ahead buy this phone.  I also appreciate Amazon service who delivered this phone with in agreed time.

I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day. Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes.
I expect this might be software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.
Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me. Plz no bay this mobile

The camera is very good in the price range. I likes the feature of best shot as well as AR emojis. The camera does well in low light also.
Coming to the battery part, it takes a while to charge however it has a big battery and it really lasts easily for two days.
I am not much a fan of finger print reader however that does not bother much.
Overall its a great package bundled with almost everything needed in a normal smartphone i.e. nice camera, great battery, clean UI, and samsung branding on the top. What else one need?
The only cons I think is it doesn't have NFC and therefore unable to use samsung pay on this. But that is manageable considering UPI payments.

A very awesome mobile, a complete  value for money.
Main highlights are its awesome display, battery and performance.
One can argue with the performance when u take gaming into account. But believe  me even in gaming its performance  is awesome.
Its a daily life phone, awesome super amoled display for entertainment ,6000MAH battery for continuous work and decent performance.

The thing i dont liked that much...
1. Camera pic output...some are good some are not natural, its seems artificial.
2. No fast charging support..it takes nearly 2hr 45 mins to charge it completely.

These are not major negatives about this phone if compare at the price its been offered.

GO AHEAD FOR IT.....üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç

Best in size with amoled display.
Excellent delivery by Amazon within 24 hrs.
Mega powerhouse in hand.
Best in smooth processor.
With 64 mp camera, quadcore camera setup is good and macro photography is best.
No problem of overheating while using or charging.
Fast charging is good.
Totally a best phone with the price.

Fingerprint reader is awesome both in its view and working.
Camera quality isnt as we can say 64 mp but the wide angle it creates and captures is awesome. Selfie camera is thumbs up.
Baterry life was the primary thing i went for and in this range this battery pickup is great.
The touchscreen, smooth touch, sleek and classy look is more than the price.
No heating problem, no hanging problem, bit of network connectivity problem probably due to the operator.
I would have given 4 straightaway. But .5 is to be added for the low price range and .5 is to be cut for the not so 64 camera quality. So i go with 4.5*

Portrait mode of camera is good

The look of the phone is amazing! Its sleek and looks prettier than a lot of more expensive phones.. however the face unlock is not sensitive, it doesn‚Äôt unlock if youre wearing glasses at all! The battery seems good enough but i haven‚Äôt used it for very long so can‚Äôt really say. What I‚Äôm most disappointed with is that it doesnt come with headphones!!

Editing the review since camera results are very poor. Too much smudges and noises and looks like either faulty product or incorrect advertisement regarding camera specs.

Well crafted product, but very poor camera quality
Pros -
good picture quality
Nice display
Biometrics is faster
Blue color on the back looks classy
Good batter life

Cons-

Given the specifications found the performance a bit lacking

Overall a good phone for the given price range

I never had a bad experience but this is the bad choice , I choosed to buy samsung m31 phone. Bad experience. Main problem is too badly got heat back camera part and when you will make a call same back portion will vibrant. And also company given 6gb ram when you play online games , games will lack too badly. Maybe companies fault . Lots friends said after samsung is not a. Good phone for roughly use. This is ladies phone. Really I am agry for this. I got lots of problems. Even I didn't go for return coz from the next day lockdown also started.

DISLIKES:
I ordered the phone on sake day at 1 PM with delivery on the same day.
But Samsung shocked me by giving defective product
  Defects:
No sound will be produced by the phone in any of the below ways:
-headphone audioJack not working
-caller audio receiver not working
-speaker not working

Videos won't be played in the normal speed.It will only play at 2√ó speed.

Being the Samsung user in the form of TV,bluetooth neckband and mobiles for many years.I am upset in receiving the defective product on the opening day.Hope they will be taking care of quality control.

LIKES:
Replacement accepted and there comes the mega monster.Excellent performance with RAM Management,battery and  camera.

Samsung interface provides seamless usage.After receiving the quality product I even forgot about the bad first impression  created.

WHO can Buy:
-Camera is priority
-Wants some bigger battery
-day to day regular usage
-Normal gamers.Gaming performance is good.Any game can be played,but not at very very high configuration.

For this price,other Chinese products may assure more specs but the brand value decides the mobile life.Think wisely

PHONE WONT' SATISFY:
-Gamer addicts.But you can look for A71.
-onscreen finger print sensor-A51

Now I have recommended the phone in my friend's circle too.
For this price,this is a real mega monster.

REVIEW is about positive's and negative's.
Samsung should have eye on negative points keenly and that should be helping them to overcome the barrier.

Hope,I will be getting the JBL headphone for my review and Samsung won't betray me in this by giving the prize to positive reviewer'süòÅ

This is honest review after 10 days of use. The phone looks promising with the features detailed in website. I am using 6 gb + 128 gb space black varient
Pros:
1)super display- super amoled brings viewing experience to next level.
2)mega battery- enough for full day heavy usage. People who are interested more in social media browsing, its a major advantage. You need not to worry for battery backup as this phone has a power bank inside.
3) amazing camera- camera quality is just awsome. 64 mp camera adds life to images.
4) samsung assurance - this product has samsung brand value and id supploes with high quality finish and long lasting durability
5) no heating issue- even if you use phone for hours you would not feel any heating at the back.
Cons:
1) slow charging - even though samsung claims to have equipped the device with fast charging then also actually phone take close to 1.5 hours for full charge from 30 % to 100%. This might be due to large battery size proportionaly making charging time to increase.
2) missing led notification- though its not a major thing to note but could add value if provided.
3) As claimed , processor is not blazing fast, though this phone is great for day to day useage but gamers may feel little disappointment while playing high resolution games.

Overall its a great budget phone for modrate users and media lovers.

Don't buy. Not worth 15k. Worst camera. Phone is getting warm for normal usage(not even playing games). You cannot return this after buying. Amazon will tell stories instead of refunding.
Amazon technician is not visiting on time and it's very frustrating after paying 15 k for this nonsense piece. Farid amazon.

Best Mobile from Samsung I Purchased on First Sale from Amazon, In Just Rs:16000/ You get A Samsung Mobile with 128 GB of Internal Storage, 6GB RAM &amp; 6.4 Inch Super Amoled Screen.
Best part of it Mega Moster 6000 Mah Battery first from any Mobile Co.
You can buy this Mobile without second thaught. I m enjoying 3 day of Battery life on moderate use.
Thank Brand Samsung n Amazon quickly delivered to me within 12 hours.

I had previously used Note 5, S8, and Note 9 before switching to M31. Foremost reason was massive battery life, which has proved right.

Forget daily charging. Even with heavy use, phone will be on for more than 2 days without any charging.

Rest are too perfect... camera for daily use, looks, balance, screen vividness...

Finally do not go for Vivo or Xiomi or Realme etc. Buy this phone and never regret.

Everything has it's cost and accordingly you will get the benefits. Same comes with mobile as well. After uses of more than 5 months i am writing this review.
Benefits:-
1.You will have an awesome call clarity over speaker,headphones, bluetooth or over the ear.
2.if you are music lover it has multiple play options along with Digital dolby which really make feels of sound ocean(i am using sony MDRzx220BT)
3.Screen resolution is awesome and reading mode is perfect. SAmoled gives you feel of touch.
4.Battery life is as expected. With continuous music listing and net surfing it will last a day.normal uses 2 days around. It's really monster.
5. Camera is really awesome and in night mode it's clarity you can see. Super se upper. Wide angel feature is cool and you can cover larger area

You may get upset when:-
1. During phone update you may fill mobile is getting heated.
2. S/R ratio is low which is good for your health but if network strength is low you may get call drop.
3. Front camera is little lagging but through settings you can take perfect selfy.
4. Till date did not face any other issue.If found will upadte here again.

Please like this review if you find helpful else you can dislike as well.

5. Optins wise also it has many features that we can enable  for the smart usage.
6. Quality of sound is awesome.... feel like we are in theater. Have DolbyAtmos option to change the sound effect. It depends on how you feel it.

Cons:
1. Vedio of the quality not that much  expected. Not sure there might  be some configurations. Not checked as of now.
2. Feeling little heat when we are on the sim card net. Also when we are on calls l, even this  also may be initially.

Finally with the above pros and cons we can buy it wth out comparing other products which are available on the market.
Thank you.

I had ordered this phone on the day of launch. I got it very next day .Appreciate the quick delivery by amazon. I have been using this phone since a week . It has been a really good experience so far.
Pros:
Battery life is really good and stays for a day without charging
Camera quality is amazing.
Smooth touch screen and quick response in  the UI
The UI part of Android 10 is quite amazing.
The sound quality is ok .
Finger print sensor is very effective.
Performance is really good.

Cons:
Sometimes phone gets heated up.
They could have given ear phones and a back cover .
The packaging by amazon was very average.

Almost everything is perfect!
‚Ä¢ The "best part" of it is its battery which lasts for almost 10 hours of heavy usage. Mediocre usage will last for like 1.5 days, ideal for long train journeys!
‚Ä¢ The camera quality is very good.
‚Ä¢ It stutters sometimes while heavy usage.
‚Ä¢ Google Due video calling was a bit laggy.
‚Ä¢ Don't know about gaming performance as I don't use it for gaming purpose.
‚Ä¢ 128GB feels like you don't need any storage device anymore. It's like you have your work related each and every thing in your pocket.
‚Ä¢ Experience of viewing videos at night in an amOLED screen is blissfull.

UPDATE: I hate this phone... how can a phone just crash and reboot lying on the table without being used? This *NEVER* happened with my Motorola G5 Plus!

======================================================================================
Looks surprisingly thin. But not great. Samsung UI is ok, but not great. Lots of bloatware.. some I could uninstall, but some I couldn't. Installed Microsoft Launcher over the Samsung UI.

Took some photos.. it didn't stand out. Though I need to take more photos to judge.

The one thing which I absolutely HATE is the position of the single speaker.... it's just where I usually place my right pinky finger to hold up the phone. And this drowns out the sound of the video. It's very important to buy a phone with dual speakers.. preferably one that is at the top.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated after more than a month of usage:
- The phone heats up during charging.
- It has crashed and rebooted 2-3 times while in the middle of something.
- Low light videos are TERRIBLE.
- Compass calibration keeps going wrong. Every time I have to use it, I need to re-calibrate it.
- Speaker is not good at all. Part of the reason is the placement. My 3 year old Moto G5 Plus was much better.

I wish I had bought the Redmi Note 9 Pro :(

I have been loyal Samsung user for years now. This one works smooth but trying to get used to its screen length. Camera works fine. I haven't noticed any difference between normal cam mode and 64mp mode, but both are fine. Macro lens version is to be simply admired. Slow motion works well too. Overall it's a good phone. I am satisfied.

Battery life and RAM performance is very good, but the USP - 64MP main camera and other 3 cameras do not perform to the specifications. No portrait mode so no 3D photos on FB. Even the 64MP main camera fails to capture details and objects blur on zooming in - not at all expected. Macro camera does some good work, but not able to capture details required for a macro photo. Wide angle camera and live focus are just good enough. Night mode is not so impressive. Overall, average camera gives average rating for the otherwise good phone.

Loved it!!!
Definitely value of money it is.
Ppl who are criticizing about the bad performance or poor camera , stop being a cry baby and STOP FRETTING ... Great fone within this budget WTH u guys expecting
Firstly not a big fan of Samsumg but this is some real gold guys.  great performance and camera is good too.. tho is not good for those who want to play hardcore games 24x7 ... obviously the battery and performance will degrade soon if such games played for long.. GO FOR IT..

This was definetely a great upgrade from Samsung for me as I have been a customer since last 5 years.
Highlights for me
1.Macro camera-It capture pictures with every minute details.
2.64 MP camera-This is something next level as images were size more than 8 mb according to lighting conditions which is equivalent to dslr sizes and detailng is also crystal clear here.
Moreover the Monster Battery that stands out over all of these  6000mah,once full charge in the morning can easily run for 2 days.
 Loved it.

The One ui is filled with lot of features .The camera and battery 6k mah is best.Camera quality is sharp with better detailing,good dynamic range.Must buy it.Selfie camera Sensor sony (imx616) is great.The 5mp macro shots are better.Built quality is better than m30s.The camera is far far better than any other brand phone in this price.But the back side can be easily  scratched so its better to use a case or vinyl.Battery lasts approx  2 days without using internet. Battery lasts 10hour 30 minutes of continuous
gaming, video playback, etc...
Camera: 10/10
Battery: 10/10
Built quality: 9/10
User interface:10/10
Display:10/10
Gaming: 9/10 ( medium level gaming. Better gaming experience in PUBG with medium graphic settings)
Pros:
-FHD+ sAMOLED display
-Accurate GPS
-Large 64mp samsung gw1 sensor
- 32 MP Sony imx616  sensor
- 6000mah battery
Cons:

I came to Samsung galaxy M31 straight from using Samsung J7 pro in few days, so it felt like shedding an extra layer of skin which is lighter and more manageable with a soft touch over its screen. Its extremely well balanced and easy to hold and navigate with one hand. Display which feels like absolute best of all words - beautiful colors, perfect viewing angles, incredible 6000mAh battery etc. I would recommend trying both and seeing whether usage allows you to maintain a high fresh rate because its absolutely worth it.

Pro :
ui Is good
Battery life is good
Samsung has good display.
Calling  bluetooth , sound, wifi , everything good.
Camera is okay not that bad. Not that great cant find that 64 mp feel

Cons :
Phone is sometimes slow even for basic games u can find that crispyness literally
Switching between tabs is slow
Fingerprint at back is at wrong placement .. not that friendly
Face reader litwrally sucks. Cant identify faces all the time. Doesnt work in the dark. Obviously this is not apple.

Check for my pics taken from this phone.

I bought the phone for the sole purpose of processing power and camera. Processing power is really great and so does the 6000mAh battery. But camera is really disappointing. You expect 64MP AI camera to match the standards but it performs really poor, even worse than my Samsung galaxy A70(2018) with 32MP camera. They should look more closely in building cameras. Phone has lag for some of the heavy apps but it eventually nullify soon you start using it daily. I would say if you are buying this phone for camera then DON'T please

It is very disappointing that phone has heating issue. On simple use you will feel the heat and once you have played any game then it is like old iron. It is heat the upper part of phone i.e. camera side.

On the other hand screen stuck while using whatapps. Screen touch start working abnormal. I have brought  2 handsets i feel similar  issues in both of the handsets.

I am not a tech bug but second phone user has raised concern  to amazon they have ask to install diagnostic  software  after that i have no idea what they have done to his handset.

Firstly I was impressed by the delivery of the phone it was in my hand in just 10 hours after I book the phone in Amazon. Great job from Amazon.
Coming to M31, Really it's a monster. Unfortunately It got slipped from my hand on day 1 itself from 3ft but there is no scratch in the screen and there is only a minor rash on side panel. The battery was a beast and gives pretty good enough time to use the phone for long time. Camera was nice and overall phone performance was awesome. Really good product  from SAMSUNG.

Great Phone in this price range. Amazing battery. Although charging speed is slow, but once it charges, it does not doe easily. In this lockdown, while i am almost every hour on phone, it still gives me 1-1.25 days of backup which is amazing. Once the lockdown ends, i might get more than 2 days on medium usage. On heavy usage, i am easily getting 1.25 days of battery with SOT of more than 10 hours.

Amazing camera and amazing one ui. The UI is very rich with features.

Overall, I would recommend you to buy this phone with your eyes closed. No Redmi / Realme phone will give you so much confidence than this.

Thank you Samsung. :)

Pros.
Super Amoled Screen. Immersive Experience to watch movies.
Battery Last for more than 24 hrs continous usage. Take 2 hrs 30 minutes to fully charge from 0 to 100%
Fingerprint &amp; faceunlock are fast.
Camera. Only 64mp back &amp; selfie camera are good &amp; capture detailed &amp; sharp images.
Samsung UI is lag free Smooth &amp; with Zero Ads.

Cons. No Cons so far...

I have moved down from note 8 which i bought for 64 thousand 2 years back, from amazon. I purchased this for 16 thousand. I was expecting a major downgrade but i am happy to share that the user experience is just as good. The battery impresse me and i am astounded that samsung delivered the same screen quality that i had on the note 8. Camera is decent but i am comparing it to a note so my expectations are high. The weight distribution is so good that it feels much better to hold than to hold a note 8. I have used it tocplay call of duty mobile and it works well with medium settings.

I dont think you can get better value for money at this price and that too with service support of a behemoth like samsung.

One of the best options in the segment.
I preferred this phone for its sAMOLED display  and I am very happy  with it's look and performance.  To my surprise software one UI is smooth performing and practical.  Samsung's galaxy M series has been trustworthy brand against many aggressive competitors. Packaging and charger design could have been better. Anyhow satisfied with choice.

Best buy for an average consumer for media consumption, watching youtube, and streaming services online...
The screen alone makes it worth of buying as it's way way better than the panels on its competition.
The camera quality is great and even better than the competition.
Battery life deserves a mention wherein for a heavy user, you won't be left searching for charges... it easily lasts one full work day without needing to be charged.
Fingerprint scanner could be better positioned but its fast which is great.

Gaming would be slightly compromised when compared to its competitors, but I dont think an average user would notice it, because the screen has wonderful color accuracy and contrast

Overall the best purchase in this price range.

I've got the 6GB+128GB variant and thanks to early access and Prime Delivery experience....
Pro:
1. The first thing that you notice is that the mobile feels pretty lightweight for a 6000mAh battery pack with impressive performance.
2. The 6.4inch FHD+ SAMOLED panel -  best display in the price range.
3. Versatile rear quad camera setup and front facing camera with very decent image quality, great video performance under daylight.
4. Refined One UI 2.0 with Android 10 out of the box makes the device snappy to use and.
5. The physical rear finger print scanner works pretty fast, accurate and even when the finger is wet.
6. RAM management is quite good and storage provided is great which can also be expanded upto 512GB.
7. Price.

Cons:
1. The same Exynos 9611 chipset from it's predecessor M30s is a decent processor and it handles the day to day tasks pretty well but the mobile feels under-powered for some reason. But at this price tag a Snapdragon 712 or 730 SoC chipset would be make this mobile an aggressive one.
2. The camera performance under low-light conditions is poor and makes the image look smooth lacking details. Same in the case of zooming into the subject during daylight. And again this is the only downside for such a good camera setup.

My experience with this mobile is quite satisfactory so far and I would recommend buying this mobile. Also use a case and tempered glass for drop protectionüôÇ.

I have been using this device for more than 2 weeks. I am an above-average user the battery lasts around 40 hrs plus. I am happy with the device.
1. About the OLED screen: I can adjust the color saturation, I have reduced the color saturation as I am not that used to vivid OLED displays. Brightness is pretty decent one good feature is that we can reduce the brightness to a lower level such that I don't want to install any 'Dark mode' application for night use.
2. Camera: Camera is pretty good, the wide-angle view is pretty handy when we don't have much space in the room. The front camera is also pretty decent on low light(Recommended).
3. Weight: It is pretty heavy as it has a massive 6000mah battery. However, the weight is balanced so it is nice to hold on, we won't feel it too heavy when we hold it for a long time.
4. Performance: Performance is a said as in the paper, I have tried Call of Duty and worked in medium graphics well.
5.Bluetooth: Bluetooth is important for me as I usually take calls with my Voyager Wireless headphones. Connection time is extremely low . I could turn on my headphone while phone is ringing and the next second the headphone is connected. I used to wait/need to manually connect on my old Zenfone max. So this is a great value add for me
NB: This is not a dedicated gaming phone.
To conclude with this is a very good phone for people who travel a lot and watch movies , surf internet, attend online meetings during their travel. This is not the phone for gamers

The fone is awesome overall. I just hv one problem. The screen I view before clicking a picture and the one that is captured are missin 4 inches.. is this a fault? I hv used samsung fones before and never had this problem but this seems like a fault wid this specific handset. I don't kno if other m31 users have the same issue. But please look into this.

What I like about the phone is that the touch is smooth, the back camera is good but i honestly expected better considering that is its usp. The 2nd day of using the phone my instagram stopped working and was force closing every single time and the whole phone would freeze and not work for 30secs. The battery life is surprisingly not good. It takes a long time to charge since its 6000 mah battery but drains completely in a day. The face unlock is not that fast. The camera is noisy at night and the wide angle sides gets distorted. Even the front camera is not that good at low light. Also absolutely hate that Samsung has so many pre installed app which cluster the phone and is of absolute no use.
Overall an okay phone, for me i expected better at 17k.

Nice phone with almost all advanced features.
Pros:-
1. Display is FHD and full marks to it.
2. Sound quality is ok.
3. Android 10 is handy.
4. Full marks ro 64MP quad camera.
Cons:-
1. Battery is never felt like 6000mah. Rather it performs like 4500mah.
2.while receiving the call the panel sensitivity is poor.

Overall value for money. Must buy.

After usage of 3 months. I can say this product worth it for Samsung lovers . Here are some prons and cons of this product
Pros
Battery superb battery hard to beat by any other in the market
Display  is fabulous, eyes never get hurted super amoled is what for Samsung known although display size is good
Camera the quality of camera is superb outisde and night camera is quite good , but when comes to indoor photography camera is struggling with colors contrasts,
Fingerprints sensor quite good and face unlock also
User interface is normal but some missing small features like three finger to take screenshot and abesence of full screen caller picture
Cons
Processor,  coming with exynos 9611 is decent processor but  while charging the phone it sometime stuck/hang after that im going through hardboot (vol down +power button)
Charging issues comes with product first of all it comes with 18 watt charger it tooks more than 2 hrs to charge the mobile and in summer afternoon when heat in the atmosphere phone also heatsup while charging

I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks now and I must say that I am very much impressed. The camera quality is just amazing. Even in low lights, the picture quality is amazing. The screen is always been a usp of Samsung phones and this phone screen lives upto the expectations. Battery life is simply amazing. For me it goes thru the second day with almost 4 to 5 hours of gaming, 2 to 3 hours of internet surfing and calls as well. Fingerprint sensor is pretty good as well. I have not experienced any lag while using the phone and switching between different apps is smooth. Overall a nice phone in such great price.

having 6000mAh battery , backup is only 24hrs on use so....shame on battery backup
secondly, upermost part gets heated time to time
and thirdly, face lock sensor is bit slow , camera is ok'ish and no back case inside the box
so overall at this rate i.e @16000 one should never look for this phone and plzz buyers don't go on the specification provided plzzz...i went but!!
BATTERY BACKUP IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE !!!!
CAN'T BELIEVE specially from Samsung

I prefer Samsung than any Chinese brand mobile because I believe it's more reliable and trusted brand.
M31 is having good display, camera is good, and awesome battery backup. Only  issue I found with this mobile is it takes a long time to charge about 2 hours, so having 6000mAh is not effective unless you keep it at charge on night (the reason for 4 star).

I will not recommend this product to anyone due to the following facts:
1. Exynos 9611, which is a 10 nm processor, produces so much lagg.
2. 6000 mah battery is just a gimmick. It is also not comparable with even 4000 mah battery of other brands. It does not even last for a single day with moderate usage i.e. surfing with wifi connectivity (no gaming or watching videos).
3. 64 mega pixel camera is another gimmick. No detailing is there. Capture is very much grainy. Pixel is also visible.
4. Build quality is just not bearable. It gives feel similar to 7-8k phone. Cheap plastic is used in the back.
5. Charging time is horrible. Near about 2.5 hours for full charge. It gives feel of black and white time!!

I tried several times to contact Amazon technical team but they are not responding. Hopeless!!

I have been using this phone for almost 3 months and I have a mix review to this phone.
It is in good competition with redmi phones in this price range, however yet again samsung has failed in phone hang issue. This phone in 3 months has already hangs a lot. (I dont play any heavy game on this phone and have limited apps and data).
Fingerprint sensor is a area of improvement. Sensitivity is low.
Battery is good....
Camera is also good....
Overall average experience...

Such a awesome phone at a good price. The battery is big beast and even camera can be seen like fabulous, images are such a beast one's and night shot is lit. I loved this phone and everyone should read this review and should buy this mega monster.

Pros:
1. Good camera
2. Big battery (Even it lasts 3 days and for standby it may lasts for 5 to 6 days)
3. Big storage
4. Super amoled display is lit.
5. For gaming its beast(PUBG works like cool on this one ,even on hdr ultra settings i got no frames drop.)
6. One UI 2.0 is best UI in this category.

Cons:
1. Slightly heats up while charging.

I'll declare that this phone is the best phone at this range.

Samsung phones essentially have the best price-to-feature ratio. The surprise factor with the Samsung M31 is the camera. It is absolutely amazing. The picture quality is just too good. In any mode, it is stunning. And then the other features, be it the battery life, the sound quality, the video quality, or the processing speed, are at par with the best. I dont think that at this price point, any other company can pack in even half the features. Buying this phone is an absolute no-brainer.

Really amazing phone  after 4days of use . Samsung is best in battery 6000 mah .  every  time I use to carry power bank for charging.  Now no tension , no power bank, and no charger.
Comes to display : really I am very  happy  for dispay  with low budget I got amoled display.
Next comes memory and ram: I bought  6 GB and 128 gb store and with expanded memory  slot.

For this specification: other phones are 18k +

Update as per 11 April 2020 SW update fail:-
I want to say that it's a good phone...however Co. needs to build on handling its own the software glitches unlike many phones such that if SW update fails, phone automatically restores itself to operable state.
The issue with me - a system update made the phone dead and now I want to return the product and buy a different Samsung phone given the lockdown situation in the country and all its service centres closed.

Please suggest what should be done?

Updated review post SW recovery :- stars updated from 3 to 4.
The samsung team responded well and recovery of my dead phone was made possible. Phone is working pretty ok since then except the battery unit in it. The battery efficiency has fallen since then.
Had the problem not happened, this phone deserved a generous 5 star. üëç

Update as on June 2, 2020:-
Pretty satisfied with its performance. Very dependable phone. The display quality is top notch. Camera is awesome. Hands-on feel of the phone is pretty premium at this price point. File transfers are smooth across other devices. I am very much satisfied with this Samsung unit especially when it faced such an issue before. What more to go well down with such an awesome device alongwith a super prompt customer service.
Must go for this!!üëç RECOMMEND.. RECOMMEND.. RECOMMEND..
I was an Mi user before Samsung and trust me on this that THIS PHONE BEATS MI IN EVERY DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF QUALITY. Go Ahead Guys !!

1-Great screen for watching content (best in this range)
2-Biggest battery (i guess in future it would be even better with the software update)
3-Samsung clean and best user interface
4-really good set of cameras ( 4 in the row )
5-Very good selfie camera
6- 6GB Ram and 64GB ROM which can be increased with SD card
7-2 4G volte SIM card slot ( a total of 3 slots are there ).
8-Fast charger in the box (however it takes 2.5 hours to charge it full)
7-Good speakers (though we have only one set of speaker downwards. Decently loud with good quality.
9-cannot be said as best gaming phone at this price but with its 6GB RAM and SAMOLED screen you can enjoy gaming as well.
10-Last but not the least the prestige of SAMSUNG and its trust that you get .SECURE AND SAFE and you also get anti malware inside

Handson experience after 10 days.
Really disappointing product from Samsung. This is utlra hyped product. Its a marketing stratagy of samsung to promote it. Only battery is the feature of the phone which last around 1.5 days on heavy usage. i am a game freak and it is good for that.
The camera is pathetic mark my word pathetic its a 8 megapixel camera which they branding as 64 megapixel. when you zoom after cl8cking a photo there is no details. its all blurred out and you feel cheated like anything. the selfie camera sucks. Overall experience is bitter. I really dont like the smartphone. it is all plastic body and quite compressable. I have oppo reno phone i felt it is 1000% guinine than this cheating phone. Be aware before you buy. 2 star is only for battrry only battrry.

Last 4 years, i was using  Samsung galaxy on next, when I seen Samsung galaxy m31 launched on Amazon, I seen all feature m31, I really socked  64 miga pixel camera, 6000 MH battery, 6GB Ram, 64 memory, it unbelievable price only ( 14,999/-), I really liked this phone camera quality &amp; battery backup, also phone running very fast, phone color and design very cool, thanks Amazon. üôÇüòÉ

Hi, I can tell that dont waste your money in this phone. This phone is not stable at all. Hang and Restart issues are too frequent which can spoil your mood when you really need phone to work faster.

Battery life is good.
Camera is fine.
Phone is very slippery. May be logic behind this to slip and fall, crack screen and pay to Samsung to replace screen.
Face recognition is also not good (will not work in night)
Finger sensor is not at all good.

@Amazon, can i return it back now ? Due to Covid-19, i could not able to return it

Ok ok product...I don't know how people are giving so much rating for this product...
My review post 2 weeks of usage:
Pros:
Budget friendly
Nice camera with nice features.especially wide angle and slow motion.
Nice amoled display.
Battery is also ok.
Cons:front camera adding so many filters which I dont like...missing the natural picture die to these filters.camera specs dient match the quality of pictures.
Battery is taking around 3 hours from 0 to 100 which is too much time.at the same time draining in 1 and half days of modern usage.
Face lock is not smooth sometimes responding bit slow.
Very low sound comparative my any previous models whether its samsung series or redmi series.
Mobile also doesn't works seamlessly.taking 1 or 2 secs to open the app some times.

Finally so so product.and could be I expected too much from the config they mentioned abt.

This phone is best when it comes to display and battery, the camera is also awesome and is better compared to its rivals at this price segment. The performance of the phone is nice. One can play games easily in HDR graphics but if one plays for 4-5 hours continuously then a bit throttling can be observed. This is a not a gaming phone but can support casual and heavy games. For normal users this is best phone under 20K. The UI is awesome and has many customisation. The phone is made in india.

Speed of mobile is Good, no hanging, smooth gaming. For me Camera not up to the mark...as I earlier used Samsung note5 and 8mp of note5 is much better then this 64mp. Samoled is great. Finishing of the product is so not good....alignment of fitting lacks perfection. Camera holes alignment or side edge you can see poor craftsmanship.

Samsung has done a pretty good job in the mid range segment with it's M series of smartphones.

Display: Thanks to the S-OLED the display is crisp and clear with excellent viewing angles, better than any other non samsung phones in the mid range segment. Colour reproduction is excellent, but too sharp if set on vivid. You can set it to natural through display settings for more natural feel.
Rating: 5 of 5.

Battery: First ever phone containing a 6000 mah battery. Believe me it is a mammoth battery, It gives a day and half battery backup with medium use. Normal use can easily last for 2 days. Phone feels light knowing it has a mammoth battery. I have Asus Max pro M1 with 5000 mah battery feels heavy compared to Samsung M31.

Rating: 5 of 5

Performance: The Exynos 9611 does a pretty decent job in handling daily phone activities. It handles pubg well too. But mind it this is a midrange phone, considering this it's awesome on gaming part too. For pubg, on high settings the device gets a bit hot but that's normal since pubg uses a lots of hardware resources and some game lag here and there, but again it's ok at this price point.

Rating: 5 of 5

Sound: Sound is a taken care of a mono speaker on the bottom right of the phone, Not loud but ok enough. The placement of speaker is odd for me though as my hand comes over the speaker while in landscape mode for watching videos or movies. Sound through headphones is nice (depends on your headphones too). I have a House of Marley Smile Jamaica earphones and the sound produced is crystal clear.

Sound: 4 of 5

Camera: My god the rear cameras are excellent in good lights. You can zoom the picture taken to the point it can't be zoomed further and you will find no or negligible noise in the pictures. Front selfie camera does a decent job too. Can be better in low light as the pictures taken are noisy and grainy. This will be eliminated in further OTA updates (Hope so). Videos are excellent too. The camera app includes all features for tiktokers too.

Rating: 4 of 5.

Call Quality: The most important factor of a phone which is rarely reviewed, only one word "Excellent". No unusual sounds while on call through the earpiece, even when on loudspeaker you can hear the other person very well even if you have some disturbances around. Mic does an excellent job as well the person on other can hear you clearly.

Rating: 5 of 5

Storage: It depends on the variant you choose. I bought one with 6gb ram and 128 gb internal storage. Massive storage at this price. 6 gigs of RAM ( DDR4) helps you seamlessly multitask without any lags or reloads.

Rating: 5/5

Conclusion: A must buy mid range device that has all the features a smartphone user wants. Truly an all rounder device.

Really I am so impressed with the new Samsung M31 smartphone.I bought it from amazon and delivered it to me within time.Following are the reviews of this smarphones based on thier performance I used it during a month.

CAMERA:the quad rear camera is so good.The pictures which is captured is so clear and doesnt even blurred thtough zooming .The video i recorded is also of Full hd quality and seems to be recorded through high pixel digital cameras.

DISPLAY:The super amoled display of M31 is also do good.The crystal clear display enables me to use it effectively during bright sunshine unlike other smartphones.

BATTERY:The superb 6000 mah battery is so high Even after continuous use of 10 hours the battery drains a little .And fast charging enables this phone to charge fastly .

NETWORK CONNECTIVITY:Both sim support 4G connectivity and network strength capacity is also good.

FINGERPRINT SENSOR: This phone comes with a rear fingerprint scanner which allows me to unlock my phone less than a second and Face unlock id is also works good.

RAM And MEMORY: I bought 6Gb ram and 128 gb storage variant.I have played several games of high quality like Pubg but even not a single glitch observed during gaming.Also multiple apps opening at a same time doesnot hangs my handset.I have not observed any hanging problem until now.

SPEAKER:Sound quality is good and so loud such that we are even listen songs in loudspeaker in a huge crowd area.

WEIGHT AND DESIGN:This phone weight is not so high even it uses large 6000 mah battery.And I give it 5 star in its design .The large 6.4 inch screen it uses is so nice and I feels it so handy and carriable during walking,jogging or any other travelling.

Overall I gave this phone 5 star as it brings my life so easier and all my works which i used to do with laptop is now shifted to my new Samsung M31 smartphone.

THANKS TO SAMSUNG AND AMAZON for this great smartphone..

A good phone  if not better  ,at  this price from Samsung which is Made in India . I have ordered this mobile online after reading the reviews but I am  slightly disappointed with the performance .  I'm writing after  3 weeks of usage, andmy experience with m31 has been topsy turvy. However,  I am impressed with the long lasting battery, andslightly disapointed with speed of the processor.  Eventhough , RAM is  6GB.

Good:

-  comes with Android 10.  looks great.
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. Experienced slight heating issues and also found lagging.
- 6000 Mah battery is good enough and is lasting 2 days for me with moderate usage. So, happy with it, but takes about 2 hours or more to fully charge the battery

- 128 GB storage is pretty good for regular storage and no need of further ROM.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 20 percent charge. But, Charging took in excess of 2 hours
- Mobile speakers sound is ok, but not as loud as , other budget phones of this price range. This is a big let down for me.
- Camera is good. Macro performance is very good - daytime pics are good but night photos are a bit worrisome.  A big letdown in this price range, vis a vis , other competitors. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. So, no need to carry a professional camera,  as the day light pics are as good as a pro.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is  good, if not better.
- Received after two months of ordering,  due to lock down of covid19

Not So Good:

- bulky, but ok.
- Doesn't have Samsung Dex

Feedback

- A bit slippery in hand, dropped twice but lucky recovered without any damage.  No screen guard or gorilla glass. Already, find some scratches after two weeks of continuous usage. Could have been supplied with gorilla glass this price.

amazing handset in price segment, great features, most and important is don't want to by MI as its origin from Virus country, I feel my contribution towards India and exchange MI with this device.
I insist to all great Indians, never by from Virus country and replace or return if you own it.

Its almost 1 month since i bought this mobile. 1st impression is impressive... you cannot resist picking  it up again and again... check every angle.. every service. Every settings... its marvelous...

Camera is good for normal user... but for pro's i would not recommend it.. though you can work it out with little change in settings and here and there... autofocus is not that good but definitely not that bad too... fingerprint gives trouble sometime but other than that it works like a charm... the only issue i had it that samsung did not provide  a light border around it... so user could feel it and pace finger correctly.. the day it arrived.. i downloaded many application from microsoft word to evernote... whatsapp to skype pubG to candy crush... more the 150 app are there currently on my device but no issue of speed while switching 1 to another.. though it gets little heat up while playing pubG but not that much... and lo lagging  so far...
And above all boss 6000 mah battery... for normal user ... if you charge your phn 100% and in normal use taking phone calls.. texting chatting..listening music.. playing normal games... it last 70-75 % at the end of day... woooow...
I am not an high end user... and i am well aware about price range... so for me ints 4 out of 5... but for those who need everything perfect kindly incrrase your budget till 20k i must say m31 slay every predator around it.....

I bought the black 6GB/128GB variant a week ago and have been using this phone ever since. I'm happy with its performance in general, so far.

Few things which I feel require a quick mention:

1. Battery - Although the phone has a fast charging capability, my device takes roughly between 1.5 to 2.5 hours to completely charge, which is a bit disappointing, but the battery lasts easily for 24 hours so that's okay. Still disappointed about the slow charging bit.

2. Camera - The primary camera performs best in an outdoor lighting condition with a fairly decent color reproduction. The EIS for 1080p videos is good. The front-faced camera captures good pictures and records video decently in indoor lighting conditions. Didn't get to check it in an outdoor condition.

3. Other features - The build quality looks premium. The volume and the power buttons appears to be of good quality. The finger print sensor has a quick response time which is great. The touchscreen quality is indeed good. The OS operates well, I haven't noticed any lag so far. The dark mode is a welcome addition to this phone. Call quality is very good. The speakers are fairly loud given there's only 1 speaker grill at the bottom.

Overall, in my opinion M31 is a value for money phone from Samsung.

*** What i liked in this device:-
+ Large Display of 6.44 Inch which is Super AMOLED FHD+ Infinity U Displa
+ Camera (64MP f/1.8 Samsung GW1 Sensor, 8MP Ultra Wide-Angle Lens, 5MP Depth Sensor &amp; 5MP Macro Sensor)
+ 6000 mAh Massive Battery
+ Massive storage with decent LPDDR4x RAM (6GB Ram / 128GB)
+ Expandable Storage via Micro SD Card Upto 512GB.
+ OneUI 2.0
+ Fast fingerprint sensor and face unlock

*** What i disliked:-
- Charging Speed, huge 6000mAh battery the 15W fast charging feels too slow.
- Earphones were a great deal to get inside the box { missing the time when it was included with samsung phones }

*** Additional:-
* Camera quality is great both with pictures as well as videos but could be bit more better.
* No lags so far even with a very heavy use
* Battery remains even after whole day of heavy use

After so much of research, I decided to go with M31 on the second day of launch. To my surprise, the phone matched my Expectations. Have to appreciate Amazon for the super fast delivery, I ordered it by night around 10pm and I got the phone delivered by next day morning 9am. Packing was good and safe.
I'm writing this mobile review based on my first 2 days experience with this phone. Will add later if there is anything.

Pros:
1. Very nice battery. It was coming roughly 2 days for a moderate usage in 4G.
2. Camera is very decent. Even though it doesn't justify 64mp, still I would say camera is good with clear pictures.
3. Display is too good
4. Phone is not very heavy and good to use
5. Voice clarity and signal is good
6. Looks very good and stylish too.

Cons:
1. Finger print is placed very high in the back, needs to stretch a bit to reach the sensor
2. Charging is very slow(I understand its 6000mah), roughly 2.5hrs, could have given charger with more watts.
3. Charging cable length is very short
4. No earphones provided with this mobile.
5. Speaker is not much loud as only one speaker is provided at the bottom
6. Has mild heat when we play high end games, but its not too heat also

Overall is a Good budget phone to buy.

I share some Tech Details.

In First Photo, You see Ram in GB.
(5.43 + 2.50)(Ram + Swap Memory)
Swap memory work same as Ram and its good to see in Samsung. Also it provide you 7.93 GB instead of 6GB.(Maybe Swap memory use for Game boost)

In Second Photo, You see the home with 5x6 grid layout.

In third Photo, You see Software Details.

In fourth, You see black and white photo.(idk what you call)

Samsung Camera is good. Samsung also told you which look is good for shot(AI).

Samsung M31 is good for gaming + work + Learning(like I learn Reverse Engineering, So need Video tutorials.. instead using pendrive i use my internal storage and super awesome, when your device comes with sAMOLED display.

Battery backup is too good(6000 mAh), It something like (kab battery ktam hogi..) i use 52 hrs without puting on charging.

Samsung with 6 with 128GB it's really a #MegaMonster.ü§™üòà

Almost every call gets dropped after 20 to 30 seconds. On same SIM , other phones are working fine. So , its device problem.

Expected more on other side but not up to expectations. Over all rating a B- if calls drop issue is resolved, else its worthless.

Bought the m31 (6+128) both space black and ocean blue variants for me and my brother.here are my views about the device.
Pros:
1.Super amoled display which is more vibrant than IPS LCD pannels
2.Stunning blacks Thanks to the Samsung's SAMOLED DISPLAY.
3.Massive 6000 mah battery which lasts for around  1 and half to 2 based on our usage.
4.super user friendly thanks to samsung ONEUI 2.0 the interface is too Good.
5.come with android 10 out of the box.
6.The quad camera setup is decent enough and there is some auto focus issue which I think may be corrected with an update.
7.Decent performer for games like pubg,call of duty etc....
8.Always on display is very useful and get done the task of notification LED ofcourse there is some battery drain because of this feature.But trust me it is very less than you expected.

Cons:
1.supports 15W fast charging only which make the total charge time to around 2h 30 mins .but remember the capacity is around 6000mah which take more time to charge.
2.Design is too old as we are getting glass finish in other brands within this budget range.
3.Need improvement in the speed of unlocking phone using biometrics.

Fantastic phone in this price range. Overall its a very good smartphone. The sAMOLED screen is very sharp and clear. Fingerprint sensor is very fast. Even face unlock works great even in low light. 6000 mah batery stands true to its word. I play pubg without any lag in hd quality and high frame rate. I am a medium user of phone and watches many videos . Still the battery lasts more than 1.5 days. The phone gives a very premium feel. The camera quality is just awesome. One cannot expect any better quality in this price range. I am delighted to be the user of this phone and recommend it to everyone. This phone is just mind blowing.

I ordered this phone within few hours of launch, and was promptly delivered the very next day. Thanks to Amazon for on time delivery

I bought the ocean blue, 128 GB variant which is kind of dark blue and I really love the colour. I am no techie to review the phone on its technical aspects but as a common layman I truly love its performance since the 3 days I have been using it.

The set up  took really less time than I expected and it comes with Smart Switch App, which made the data transfer easy and smooth.

The pictures clicked from the phone are extremely good and nice, however I saw a flicker of light when I tried to take a slowmotion video. I am not sure if the flickering was because of the light or the issue was with the camera. but there was not such flickering while capturing a slowmotion video in daylight.

The battery back up seems to be amazing, Since 3 days I have charged it only once. (Other than the charging done on the first day for 3 hours). But the charging is not as fast, and I feel the 15V charger is not good enough for the 6000 MaH Battery

Overall I loved the phone it is smooth, fast and Vibrant.... and Im loving it

Pathetic product delivered, phone set delivered on 16th March &amp; i have gifted it on 23rd March, when the phone is switched on, phone touch not working, keypad not working, so many time requested for replacement, Amazon least bothered to acknowledge it, nor I have got confirmation for replacement, when we call customer care they say lock down, understand , my question is why amazon not accepting requests for replacement, I have requested for replacement( on 23r March 2020 )  before return window closed ( I e on 26th March 2020)

Very good handset in the budget of 17k that to from a brand like Samsung. i was using Galaxy A7 before to this mobile and other than thickness and few features like on-screen notifications and PIP features are missing. But Battery performance wise \ camera &amp; Display wise makes this mobile on upper hand side.

for thoose who are camera lovers and brand freakers can choose this mobile without any worries.

This is my 5th samsung phone and following are the pros and cons for this product.
Pros:-
Build quality:-2.5/5 yeah most of it is polycarbonate which feels little lighter on side but it is better than glass back for those who use phone roughly it eliminates the rust of breaking.
Style:- 5/5 yeah it's samsungüëç
Performance:- 4/5 yeah it is a monster üëç
Camera:-5/5 superb it is,üëç
Battery:-5/5 two days on the goüëç
Display:-5/5 i love samsung s-amoledüëçüëç
Fingerprint sensor:- 5/5 lightining fast
Face unlock:- 5/5 lightining fast
CONS-
polycarbonate looks like plastic.
Processor is little dizzy for hardcore gamers
Physical Fingerprint sensor is a bit outdated now a days.
Polycarbonate back is plain and fingerprint magnet.

A totally worth buy mobile from Samsung. The game changing features are the Awesome Camera and the Extraordinary Battery Life. Carrying a 6000mah battery, this phone is way lighter in comparison of other phones with the same battery.

As for the gaming performance, I didn't face any issue while playing heavy games like PUBG and Modern Combat 5.

The 6 gb ram and the Exynos 9611 processor performs very well with multi tasking and many other things.

The Night Mode, the wide angle mode, and the Super slomo mode are the features that I loved the most in the camera.

To conclude, Its the best smartphone according to me at this price point.

I brought it on the first day(March 5) it was released and seems good but after software upgradation it went for error.

You cannot switch on/off your mobile...Ot will show an error message if you put charge and it go off after the battery hot fully drained....

I gave it samsung service center on 13th june 13 after the lockdown still they are working on it first week they said they are awaiting patches from Samsung second week they said mother board has to be changed and this week i dont know what they are going to say....

I gave it for wife as a gift but she blames  that i haven't choosen a worthy one...

I haven't used the mobile more than a month and it's surprise to hear a new mobile not even a Month old got mother board problem this shows the quality of the mobile...

Most frustrating thing is none will your call they have land line and mobile number...If your fortunate they may answer you call after you continuously call them more than 50 times....

If you want to put yourself in trouble by your hard earned money then you have to choose this mobile....

Overall for me it is a wonderful product by Samsung based on the price. Getting all this features in this price range is just awesomeüëçüëç
I would give Pro's and Con's that I felt after my use of 15 days

Pros:
1) Wonderful design
2) Superb battery life
3) AmOled display is amazing
4) Camera is also good
5) Fingerprint reader as given on the back is a plus for me bcz I have seen many on screen fingerprint reader going numb.. So this is having it at the back and it's just amazing.
6) Headphone jack is avaliable
7) Fast charging is really fast üòâ

Cons:
1) Phone heats up quickly while charging and when used continuously for above 30-35 mins
2) The touch could have been a little more smoother i.e. Less resistive
3) User Interface is quite complex, took 2-3 days to completely get aquanted with it

Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) is an average low mid range product for a reasonable price. It is as fast as my Galaxy S7, but not as fast as S20. Please don't buy this phone expecting to be flagship Galaxy S20. You get what you pay for. No complains so far.

The Good:
1) Finger Print Reader is good - unlocks in 1 to 1.5 seconds
2) Battery Life is good - 1.5 days of usable

The Average:
1) Camera is average, please don't expect it to deliver S20 Quality Pictures, remember, you have paid 1/3 of S20 price.

The Ugly:
1) Bloatware from Google &amp; Samsung

Fingerprint and battery life is OK, but the camera quality is very pathetic. The only reason to choose this phone is because Samsung and now I m regretting. This is my day one and I start feeling to change this phone.

Ui is very basic  Samsung doesn't update their UI as they are thinking themselves as iPhone.

This mobile is one of the best in its price range. Firstly, the battery is rock solid. At 6000 mah, it comes for more than one and a half day's usage for a hard user like me. The display is kickass and the other features like finger print sensor and face recognition works fast too. On the design front, M31 looks like an identical twin of M30s except for the camera module which houses 4 lenses.

The quad cam is good for daylight shooting. In the night, it does feel that Samsung could've done better. But again, considering the price range and other features packed in the phone, its forgivable, I would say. The charging is quite slow because of the 6000 mah battery.

This is my third day with the phone and wrt to the first impression, I can say that this phone is a winner. If your are planning to buy one, I would recommend you to buy the 128 GB version. Hardly 1000 bucks more than the 64 GB version. But with the amount of photos and videos you are gonna shoot with this superb camera, I am sure you would want to have more memory.

Using this mobile for  almost 2 months now. Just before lockdown i bought it and it started hanging within a week so i wasn't able to place an exchange or return order complaint. The battery life is also very less as compared to other mobile phones I've used. Plus it mentions 6000mah which it definitely not at all acceptable. Also it starts to heat up pretty quickly and then you'll not be able to use your phone for another 30 mins. Not at all satisfied with the product.

This phone for its price is best in class. While Chinese phones may pack more features but Samsung is clearly a class apart.

It has the best fingerprint reader which is blazing fast.

The camera is excellent at the price point and the AR feature is a new addition that is quite fun.

The battery life is awesome. With a 6000 mAh battery it will always last a full day and then some more.

It charges quickly even though it has a large battery thanks to the included fast charger.

The screen is the best at the given price point with crisp and vivid images.

The phone is snappy with zero lag. It runs smoothly.

The fact that it can support dual Sims and an SD Card without any glitches and the fact that you don't have to decide between having two sim cards or one sim and an SD card is excellent.

The gesture controls are handy and call quality is excellent.

All in all this is completely worth the money. At this price point you simply can't get a better phone

Personally I loved Galaxy series, the Make in India products...
Features :
* With normal usage, the phone lasted over 2 days and you don‚Äôt need to carry a power bank with you anymore.
* Super AMOLED display is great and highly customizable with detailed colors.
* Fingerprint &amp; biometric are pretty quick
* Battery life is exceptional for this device 6000maH , lasts 2days with ease (minimal gaming)
* * Cameras are whole new chapter, high resolution cameras capture shots with huge detail...
Whats more interesting are the AReality support for this device...(in core)
* Even Flashlight has modes of brightness which is pretty useful...

Overall this is a great device at this price range supported by Samsung's best apps and customization...
Its a beast in performance, battery and camera...

Fingerprint Senser is great, it sense just in once. Battery life last for 11 hour when use randomly. Amoled display gives u a great fun while u watch any video. No lack between game and working. I love the product if u are searching a phone under 15000 u should buy samsung galaxy m31 6Gb with 64GB ROM. Features are amazing with new features and extra features than other phones under 15000rs. Camera quality is amazing with 64MP camera. It can help u read small words from a distance of 10m. Wide angle and macro shots are amazing. This phone is perfect in all fields in a very small price. Love u samsung for such nice product. Hope such new amazing products like this.

For a low budget phone this is the best you can buy  battery capacity of thr device is as described great battery backup speaking about the camera quality is superb only problem is the picture quality will only be great if there is a sufficient amount of lighting in the area. Display is so smooth processor speed is so great for most functionality facial recognition works flawlessly it would have have been great if they added more face emojis for the budget you cant get more than this.

Pros:
1.Battery 6000 mAh- good to last for 2 days with moderate use. (I am not a gamer)
2. Camera- good at day light shots(front &amp; back). Definitely need improvement at low light conditions. Same camera performes better than this at Realme&amp; Redmi.
3.Display- Super Amoled- best
4. It does not feel too heavy even though with 6000 mAh battery.
5. Android 10- Samsung's One UI2. Latest with great GUI.
6. Finger print sensor- fast with great response.
Cons:
1.Exynos 9611 processor - average. Not meant for gamers.
2. Plastic back.
3. Charging- ~2.5 hrs to fuel the battery full
4.Focus hunting- While recording video camera struggles to focus. You feel it only when viewed on big screens.

Pretty Decent features in a reasonable price range...
Camera is good but not exceptional, don't expect iPhone X clarity n crispiness as this is a budget phone.. Battery backup is great as expected with a 6000mh battery.

Only flaw I can point out is, the term fast charging associated with this fone Charging time varies between 4=5hrs for a full charge which is not expected

Thank you @amazon.in for delivering it real quick.
*This phone has an amazing battery life, the UI is superb and smooth.
*Performance is good if you are an average gamer but however, you can play high-end games too :P
*Does not have few bloatware or pre-installed apps, you can uninstall these apps later point of time.
*Andriod 10
*The camera is no doubt on par with its competitors but yes when it comes to low light photography you might feel a pinch..but I am sure not many of us do low light photography...however Camera performance is 8 out of 10.

Amazing crystal clear display and smooth operation. I am still not happy that the fingerprint sensor doesn't lock the phone, like my moto g. Still, it's quite a package and monster for the price.

Pros -
Screen
Camera
Battery life
RAM
Charger

What could have been better-
Fingerprint Sensor could have locked the phone
Screen isn't really scratch proof, which is understandable considering it's a 3
Plastic body
Processor is not in the league of a Snapdragon but still better than Mediatek

Overall an amazing phone, but please check for a discount. I got 500 rupees off and I'm happy.

Samsung galaxy M31 is a best budget phone for people who want superb quality camera in this range with monster battery and also with such great features which were used to be seen in phones above this range so I appreciate the work of samsung for providing such a mobile phone for people like us who want good performance  phone under this high competitive market.But there are some minor problems which can affect this mobile phone performance a little bit.But *SAMSUNG* can improve these minors mistakes.
At Las I am very happy with this phone's camera and performance.

I faced problems from day one. When I opened the box and was trying to charge the phone adapter was not working. 2nd day I went to service centre and they replaced the adapter. Battery is drying fast while it is 6000 mah. I thought there is some issue with the new phone but due to lockdown I did not went to service centre for battery problem. I am facing issue every time sometime it is restarting suddenly, due to lockdown will Amazon exchange my phone with the new one or Service Centre will replace my phone. I do not want this phone it will create lots of technical problem in future. So please replace the phone.

Nothing much to say about disliking,
Because I love this phone,
Camera quality is best,
Battery life was my preferred thing to look for and so now I dont have to worry about it after buying this phone.
Finger print reader is working best, as previously I used some other phones whose finger print reader did suck after using for a month, but Samsung so far has done a wonderful quality built.
I am happy and I know it.

Way too amazing budget phone Samsung has ever launched.
The premium quality experience you enjoy on display is beyond expectation in this range.
The finger print is also pretty good along with facial recognition feature which will suffice at this price.
Slim design is unbelievable considering the fact that it's packed with 6000mah battery and on that note, one must not forget how efficiently Samsung has managed to balance and maintain its weight.
Gaming experience is really treat to your eyes as well as your soul, not just saying but actually tried playing Call of Duty(mobile), Asphalt 9 Legends and FIFA, once again what graphic quality at this level of price range.
Camera quality is something you cannot avoid talking in Samsung phone, which in this case also, it beats all the budget phones camera in its segment.
I will just speak for myself, I am really happy with the phone introduced by Samsung, rest it might vary from person to personüôÇ

Battery life is better than others but still it cannot stand for two days with regular internet usage.
Camera is quality is great.  But using wide angle view stretches the image and distorts the faces as well .
Big space makes life easier.
Fingerprint sensor could be more sensitive.
Just missed a wow review due to little things but Overall this mobile justifies its cost.

I had recieved ae defective piece...I recieved this phone on March 16th....keypad getting stuck  from the day one...I thought due to software not update yet..bcoz one update  I kept it hold...but after update also same issue...I'm very disappointed

Technician advised to hard reset  phone .
After that also same issue...

Now it's corona lockdown...

Amazon won't exchange.. and won't respond....
Even delivery was worse for me....

Totally loss of money....

Very very bad..
About phone:
Initially battery started charging fast...now its very slow...
And people who habituated to redmi honor will get disappointed  with battery charge..

Samsung is brand  ..agreed...but ppl who wants flexibility more...I don't recommend  this product....
Even camera is also not excellent
..its just ok
Now I want reply from Amazon regarding  defective piece
.thank you

This phone is best at its price, best in class display to enjoy your content, best in class battery that lasts for the whole day, a decent processor to keep you up for day to day usage and a decent camera. I deducted 1 star for its screen, my phone screen got broken within a month at first drop from my waist height. That was disappointing but I expected Samsung to make it better with its successor.

Battery backup not very good. And i am facing frequent issues with network connectivity and also with sound.. I have to restart now and then to get it working again. Slight heating issue is also there. Overall, i am disappointed with the mobile. I dont know if these issues are in my handset only or is a model defect. Camera is just nice only and not great as i expected from a 64 mp camera. Screen display quality is good and touchscreen is very responsive though.

Samsung Galaxy M31: The Good, The Bad, And The X Factor
By Sandeep Sarkar
Updated: Friday, March 20, 2020, 16:56 [IST]

Samsung has added a new handset in the Galaxy M series dubbed Galaxy M31. The company introduced this series last year to compete against its Chinese counterparts like Xiaomi and Realme who own a major chunk of the market with feature-rich smartphones being offered an affordable price tag.

The latest entrant comes as a successor to the Galaxy M30s which has been quite popular in the mid-range segment. Carrying some traits from its predecessor, the Galaxy M31 is packed with a humongous 6,000 mAh battery and an L-shaped quad-camera module.

At a starting price label of Rs. 14,999 for the 6GB RAM+64GB storage and Rs. 15,999 for the 6GB RAM+128GB storage model, it goes up against the likes of the Honor 9X, Redmi Note 8 Pro, and the Realme XT. Let's see what this device brings to the table and how good is it against the Chinese rivals in our initial impressions:

Samsung Galaxy M31: The Good
High-Resolution Super AMOLED Display

The first thing that will grab your attention while buying this handset is its big high-resolution display. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy M31 with a 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display that churns out 1080 x 2340 pixels FHD+ resolution and has a tall 19:5:9 aspect ratio. Samsung has never compromised with the display quality; which seems evident on the Galaxy M31 as well.

The tall display complemented by high-resolution support makes it suitable for 1080p videos. Moreover, the narrow bezels all around the display give you the maximum area to watch content. The U-shaped notch is slightly bigger.

The colors delivered are punchy and vivid, something which you will find on other mid-range Samsung smartphones as well. The viewing angles and sunlight visibility seems good. But, we will be able to give feedback after a thorough usage. It is worth noting that this is the same display that the company had used on its predecessor, i.e, the Galaxy M30s. So, you can expect the same display output.

Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without any doubt.
This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Good:

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
- Received next day by 11 AM !

Not So Good:

- Not that thin, but ok.
- Doesn't have Samsung Dex
- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.
- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)
- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.

Feedback

- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.
- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.

Go for it without any doubt.

Believe me guys this is the best overall package u can get under 18k i have just brought a 64gb variant from amazon at 16k and trust me guys it exceeded my expectations
Firstly lets talk about the cons or negative points of the phone
1. The polycarbonate back is a fingerprint magnet and is quite slippery applying a cover is  Highly reccomended
2. The glass on the front is highly fragile and gets easily cracked. So applying a tampered glass is necessary.
3. The front camera performs very poor in low light
4. The fast charging is enabled by default but the battery backup is around 9hrs but if i disable fast charging i could get around 12 hrs of screen on time again that is a good thing because u can just charge it at night as it takes around 4 and half hours to charge completely

Now lets talk about pros:
1. Guys the first u will notice is its display and its amazing its the best u can get under 20k 60hz amoled is  way better than 120 or 90 hz ips lcd panels in realme poco etc the display is equivalent to the one on oneplus 7 so it gives a flagship experience it looks better than punch hole ips lcd displays.
2. Camera is just amazing dont look at the reviews on you tube cuz the 64 mp sensor is almost same on every device so u can just edit the images and adjust white bala ce exposure etc and get the same images on all the devices
In the competition
3. Software experience: Trust me guys the software experience on samsung is at next level and u will feel it only when u use it by yourself whether its the music application or even the alarm theme or its the themes collection or the user interface it gives u the flagship level experience and u wont feel u are using a midrange phone as one ui on samsung is highly customizable. Talking about the performance believe me u wont find a bit of difference in real life usage between the snapdragon and exynos 9611 it gives a lag free experience as the one ui 2 is highly optimized and pubg runs on highest setting which u can't run on snapdragon 720g equipped smartphones.
If u are planning to buy this smartphone just go for it its better than the competition

Theis phone completely suits to all my needs. I have been using realme 3 pro for the last 1 year. The phone was quite good, but the samsung m31 beats it in almost every category. This phone has sAmoled display, quite loud speakers, type c charging port, amazing aesthetic visuals, sturdy outer body and fast charging. They still have provided a heqdphone jqck in this phone. But the main feature of this phone is its 6000mah battery. I work in a 9 to 6 job, and have my mobile internet on the whole time, due to which my previous phone's battery used to drain fast and it did not run for even half a day. I had to carry a power bank or a charger with me everywhere, which was not feasible. But since I bought this phone, I did not have to complain about battery even once, as even after heavy usage all day, my phone still retains 35% battery by the time I connect it to charger at night. Moreover, the phone is still not very heavy even after having such a big battery.

The phone has 4 cameras on back and one on front. The camera provides high quality and very clear photos. The people who love instant shots will love the camera. There are a lot of features provided with the phone such as time lapse, super slow, bokeh and many others.

It has 128gb storage (which is expandable) , which should be enough for most people now a days. The 6gb ram and their highly efficient in-house exynos processor ensures that there is no lag anytime anywhere.

The only main complaint I have with this phone is that samsung one ui doesn't support 3 finger screenshot and instead provides palm swipe screenshot, which is not comfortable at all. Most of the time, it doesn't work. I really hope they provide 3 finger screenshot option in the next update.

In the next iteration of this phone they can provide a faster charging option (more thwn to 15 watt) , a screen with faster refresh rate, more efficient processor and other minor upgrades. But for now I'm 99 percent satisfied with this phone( aside from that palm swipe screenshot). This is a must buy phone.

I have been an Samsung S7 edge user before this and bought Redmi note 8 pro and Mi A3 for my wife and Mom, and used those extensively and this review is based on a comparison of all these phones.
Pros:
Firstly M31 is at its price point of 16k for the 128GB model is amazing with its overall camera performance and Battery life. The camera is definitely better than the note 8 pro. The 32MP selfie camera has the right colors output for Indian faces.
My S7 edge's amoled screen was incomparably with the budget phones till now, but the amoled screen in the M31 didn't disappoint me at all. The 5MP macro lens now makes more sense than the 2MP macro lens of Note 8 pro which I believe is useless. The M31 macro lens gave some really good shots.
Android 10 out of the box and Samsung's UI is definitely much better than Redmi or Stock android of Mi A3. For multimedia, this phone is really good with its screen quality and sound quality with Dolby atmos support.

Cons: Although people say you do not feel that the phone has a 6000 mah battery as it doesn't feel heavy but actually if you use the phone a lot and for longer durations, you will surely feel the weight. Now that is also because I use a back cover with the phone but again practically majority of us will use a back cover.
Secondly the phone is not powerful enough to play games for durations. After playing COD for 1 hour, the phones becomes a little hot and game play shows some lags. So definately not for gamers. The Note 8 pro is the best phone for gamers at a much lesser price.
Fingerprint sensor is fast enough, not the fastest though. The only thing is they should have given in-display sensor on the front as if the phone is on the table I have to pick it up everytime to unlock.

Overall for people like me who like a good lasting battery, a good screen and a good camera, this phone is perfect at this price point. Plus Samsung service which I have used a lot with older phones gives the edge to choose Samsung over others.

Samsung Galaxy M31 is a power packed Complete Smartphone. I did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and I did not find myself waiting for an app to load all over again.

The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. I enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which let you stream full-HD content.

I played PUBG Mobile on the Galaxy M31, and the game defaulted to high settings by default with the graphics set to HD and the frame rate to High. The game was playable at these settings and I did not notice any issues. After playing for 20 minutes noticed a four percent battery drop, and the device did get warm to the touch. The big battery will allow you to play for quite long without needing to plug the smartphone into the charger.

With my usage, the battery lasted us for close to two days without any issues. If battery life is important to you, the Galaxy M31 will not disappoint.

Samsung Galaxy M31 cameras

I found the Galaxy M31 to be quick to detect what it's pointed towards and lock focus in daylight. Photos turned out well and had decent details. Text at a distance was legible on zooming in. The smartphone enables HDR automatically if required. Switching to the wide-angle-camera is easy and you can get a wider field of view. However, while these shots look great as is, zooming in reveals that this sensor misses out on details. Wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges.

The Galaxy M31 is capable of separating subjects and backgrounds when shooting close-ups, giving a natural depth effect. The macro camera takes decent shots.

In low-light the Galaxy M31 takes longer to lock focus, so you will need to be patient while taking shots

Galaxy M31 sports a rectangular camera module at the back in the top left corner. The camera setup comprises three camera sensors and an LED flash. There is a fingerprint scanner in the middle, followed by the Samsung branding at the bottom. Upfront, there is a waterdrop notch at the top and fewer bezels. The chin has a 3.5mm audio jack, USB Type-C port, and speaker grille (from left to right). The head doesn‚Äôt have anything. The left side of the smartphone is home to a SIM slot and the left side houses the volume rocker and the power on/off button. Speaking of the volume button, it is placed quite high and reaching it wasn‚Äôt as easy as it is on any other smartphone.

The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, which is known as the Infinity-U display. The name arises from the presence of a waterdrop notch.

The M31 is Samsung‚Äôs cheapest phone to feature a 64-megapixel rear camera, and using pixel binning, it takes 16-megapixel photos in auto mode. And daytime performance is pretty good. There‚Äôs plenty of detail in the photos and good dynamic range. The same goes for video recording. The M31 is also the cheapest Samsung phone to sport 4K video recording (at 30 fps), and apart from a lack of stabilization, videos captured in daylight look pretty good.

With a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, it‚Äôs no wonder the Galaxy M31 can last a really long time on a single charge. I always got a full day of battery life with heavy usage, and with light to not-too-heavy use, you won‚Äôt have to charge it until late evening the next day, at least if you stick to mostly Wi-Fi. Switching to LTE brings down battery life, naturally, but you can still get a full day out of it with fairly heavy use.

Samsung Galaxy M31
What to Expect?
As Said By Samsung itself That It Is a Monster Of a Phone Since It Has Quite a Bit Upgrade when It Comes to Battery And Camera Which is Absolutely  True According to my Usage After 1 Week
Pros:-
‚Ä¢Super Amoled Display Which is The best In Market Also better Than most Of The 120Hz Displays I have Used
‚Ä¢6000MaH battery With Gaming And Heavy Usage It Easily Lasts for 1 and 1/2 Days. Even More If I Resort To Lighter Usage Close to 2 Days Then.
‚Ä¢Charger Provided Inside Is a Fast charger That Typically Charges The Monster Battery To 100% in 2 And 1/2 Hours
‚Ä¢Samsung One UI 2.0 Is Very User Friendly And fast While Operating So There Is No Issue with That
‚Ä¢Quad Camera is by Far The best in this Range I Have Used Other Phones In 20k Range But None can Beat These camera Sensors. Portraits are perfect,Macro Camera is Okayish but Overall In this price Range It is the best
‚Ä¢Exynos Processor used In This one is Pretty Fast and Handles multiple Processing Task fluently
‚Ä¢Single handed mode is enabled And Also Full screen mode is Enabled
‚Ä¢ Audio output out of this one is Good But Not The best In this Price Range

Cons:-
‚Ä¢Device Sometimes Tend To Heat Up a Little While gaming Coz This Is Not a Gaming Phone Ofcourse But The Ram Management And the Game Booster Given By samsung Manages It Well

Conclusion:-
Overall In this price Range Samsung Has Provided Us with a Beast Phone Irrespective of A little low Gaming Performance but Other than That You dhpuld Totally Go For this Phone If u Want to Watch movies And entertainment  on Netflix, Prime and also Want a good user Experience,  Battery Life and Camera

So I've been using this phone for a few days now n I will try my best to give an unbiased review of the device ...

 Let's start with design : its pretty average looking , comparable to low end phones , but it dosen't matters as it's done to reduce cost , but even my mom's  Redmi 8a looks n feels better  , (it's just 7k) , the rear mounted fingerprint sensor is fast but requires your finger to be dry , wet fingers won't open it , its accurate too n can store 3 prints  at max

Display : big kudos to Samsung,  you know a display is good when it has samsung branding , its super amoled display  is vibrant , packs punchy colours  n night mode is sook good so much better than poco x2 , easily best display in this range , even compatible to flagship displays of 60 hz

Battery : here it's kinda disappointing  , the the sAmoled  screen sucks up battery faster than you think n it works like a 5300 mah phone , but in medium  battery saving mode it works like a 6000 mah phone , so I'd recommend  using that all day , still a good battery nonetheless  never managed to get it lower than 30% . Charging time maybe long I.e 2hrs n 30_40 min but it's fair imo , I'd  really  charging it every day from 7PM to 10 PM then using it all throughout , till this hour again , tip : phones with fast charging shouldn't be charged  overnight , n yep it lasts all day

Performance : decent , exynos 9611 is decent in performance  , paired with the one ui , its lag free and won't disappoint you , but its smooth , not fast , can't run pubg on 60 fps despite having those settings max to max can go to 45 and sustain on 30+ fps , so run games on medium settings and it's fine,  medium n light games run qite well , it's in the range of snapdragon 675 to sd 712 go with poco x2 if pubg is your 1st priority

Speaking of the ui : one ui will not disappoint  you , dark mode is the best in this range  , has a tones of customization  options and its overall a good ui with zero ads , take  that miui  , blotwates are a lot but you can uninstall  them all , just mute the my galaxy app , it sents some annoying notifications  sometimes , easily the best ui next to Asus  zen ui

Heating issue: yes the battery heats up while charging but it's nothing to worry about , it happens sometimes but it won't heat up that much playing light games , n has mild heating playing pubg on HDR+ultra  , also heats up while using camera  initially  but not now,  after using it a few times  .

Speaking of camera  : camera is overall  above average , I liked the photos very well will give 2 samples too , it's good macro camera is decent  , 64 mp shots are large and not really that different from its regular shots,  but low light performance  is bad and without flash its worst
Overall it's good  , go with vivo if you need cameras

Overall verdict : if you need to upgrade  from some OLd Samsung  phone or just a upgrade n pubg / cod or gaming is not your first priority  then go for it !
You're  also getting a tier 1 brand so servicing  is easy
You will love it if you like consuming content like videos
For gaming,  go for poco x2v

Small cons ( first world problems üòÜü§≠) :
No Knox security , its given in all a series phones
Slightly less features than ui of a series phones
Slow face unlock
Can't  use flash n EIS together
Macro camera has no autofocus shittier  than poco x2's macro camera
No feature to display daily  internet uses n internet speed which is present in miui ü§ÆüòÇ
And finally: Samsung's classical mistake : nothing in the box .... but a charger that too 15 watt , the phone should support at least 18 w but  it only supports 15‚Ç© üôÑ
Gorilla glass 3 not 5!üòî

This is the best mobile phone under Rs  20,000. My detailed review after a week of usage.
1. Battery life - This phone has full day battery life. I don't have a television and mobile phone is my only source of entertainment. So you can imagine my usage pattern. I used to charge my old phone two times a day but not this beast. Easily runs through the day with maximum usage including moderate.l GPS navigation and high brightness.

2. Display - Again no other brand can dare to compare. Not even iphone. Best display. Keeping this one short because i am short of words for this display.

3. User Interface - Everything on point. One UI 2.0 is a treat to operate. Using samsung phone after a long time and it feels great to be back home after using MIUI ( xiaomi ) , EMUI ( Huawei ) and one plus. UI has all the important features and perfect placement to make it highly efficient and usefull. Screen transitions are joyful. Smoothness of another level. Feels like butter flowing under my fingers.

4. Camera - I have attatched few sample images where you can really appreciate the amount of detail this beast can capture. 64 MP shots are crystal clear with very level of detail.
Again i am short of words to explain the camera. Simply best camera phone under Rs 20,000. While all other brands keep explaining how you can use pro mode to make it intresting but in this phone you can simply point and shoot and results are always interesting. Also there is pro mode and many other modes if you still need them.
I have become a fan of this phone and a fan of samsung.
No negative points so far , i will keep updating this review in future if i find anthing good or bad.

Hi,  my name is ranjith,  living in chennai and work as civil engineer,  thanks to make a valuable  chance for give a feedback about the  grand master M31, I didn't expect this much of best futures in grand monster galaxy M31,  bcus the camera quality for both front and back was awesome and unbeatable as compare to other mobiles with in a limit prize.

Battery backup was so good,  i did a charge last 2 days before but still my mobile have 35%.

Video quality for supporting all HD content  videos,  are best to seen with high quality and dolby atmis 360¬∞ surrounding sound.

Highly secured with finger print censore.

Android 10.0 and one UI 2.0  was performed good with out hanging eventhough while use large file autocadd,  primavera,  stadd pro soft wares.

It retains the same super AMOLED display,  exynos 9611 SoC and long - lasting 6000?mAh battery. There's also a small waterdrop notch on the display. However,  when you watch movies or play games on the device,  the Infinity -V display on the device doesn't distract.
Although still great at handling basic of daily use,  and even good at handling multitasking.

The company has  essentially upgraded the cameras to offer a higher resolution  64MP sensor and quad camera setup. Good photo quality in daynight

The sumsung Galaxy  M31 comes with a familiar design.
The galaxy m31 also carries  on the good work with phone's camera  system  which is quite impressive for the price...
The ultra-wide lens on the device  makes the phone more versatile at clicking different tyoes of shots.  5 megapixel macro lens for close up shot we found to be quite good

Firstly , I am not writing a review. This what exactly I felt, I have shared below.

1st, I got a such a phone which actually last 02days battery with decent use. Trust me none of the phone has this capability till now.
2nd, Low light camera is awesome.  I took a picture at 19:30hrs at minimum street light which actually look like I took the picture at 16:30hrs in sunlight.
3rd, Others camera feature is awesome , which I am not saying, my picture saying that.
4. Front camera is also good, clear.
5. Screen flash is enough to give you decent quality pic at zero light.Frankly speaking I did a lot of experiments in a dark room.
6. It never heat up when charging. One or 02 days it heated up when I was charging at middle of the day and outside temperature was 42¬∞c. Otherwise in the morning time it charge quick and fast.
7. My friends told me dont buy samsung as samsung phone hang a lot. I have use 2 samsung phone earlier, so I know they are right but still I bought this phone for camera as 64mp samsung camera, so I ignore that. After using a month I gave my phone and said use as much as application,  if it will hang I will give this phone free. They use 15 applications at a time and playing pubg in this phone. They did not found any lags even.
8. The ram availability is less 3.4 to 3.6 while not using. While using still you will have 1.4 gb available after using 12 applications were opened.
9. Fingerprint reader work fast , accurate better than my last phone J7 max.
10. Look wise it gives the feeling of Samsung S20 phone, lite weight . Better than any phone.
Dear all, go blind for this , you will not regret 1% even.

This phone is worth buying. I will list pros and cons.
Here are the pros:
1. The very first thing to mention is the camera setup. The image quality is too good in this price range. Both front and rear camera can shoot FHD videos with slomo videos as well. The 64MP shooter does satisfying job.
2. Second thing where samsung never disappoints is the 6.4 inches super AMOLED screen which is the best. The colors are very natural and prominent.
3. The huge battery is far away from other phone which has endurance of around 1 and half days even after heavy use.
4. The exynos 9611 works well for daily use.
5. The phone is not at all heavy even if it has huge battery. The weight balance of this phone is great. Thumbs up for that.
6. The One UI is the best. It gives a smooth experience on top of android 10.
7. Physical fingerprint and face unlock both are fast.

Here are the cons:
1. First thing, I dont know why samsung is putting the same processor in all of their mid rangers. Though Exynos 9611 does a good job of daily use. But it will disappoint heavy users.
2. The macro camera works good in better light conditions, though it is just to attract the customers.
3. I have seen some glitches while switching apps. Hopefully samsung will take care of it in sytem updates.
4. The speaker is decent but it gets covered while using phone and you may face problems while playing media.
5. The deisgn of this phone is not eyecatching but its definitely not bad as reviewers tell.
6. Samsung could have provided at least 25W charger. Charging speed is slow but its always a trade-off about what you need.

I was looking for a budget phone with a decent battery and camera.

Samsung M31 seemed to fit in that category perfectly.

Pros
1) A gigantic battery of 6000mah with a 15v quick charging option. Gives you so much relaxation when you are using multiple things through the day. Have sailed through a day without battery charging.
2) The Live focus feature on the camera works pretty well for the price it is being offered.
3) Great captures with minute detail capturing under ample light. I am yet to use it under low light.
4) Pretty lightweight for a phone with such huge battery size
5) Two Sim card slots plus a memory card slot over and above the 128 GB storage is a bonus
6) A secretly hid Dolby Atmos feature which adds quite an impact on the sound when on bluetooth or earphone

Cons
1) A very outdated processor which doesn't do justice to the 6GB Ram being offered. The functioning is quite okay
2) Need to really work on the Face Unlock technology. I had to stop using face unlock on the second day because I was tired of so many disapproval from my phone
3) Once you disconnect the call there is a 2 second lag for the call screen to go away which gets pretty annoying.
4) Lot of redundant apps being given with the phone and loads of unwanted samsung apps attached which doesn't add value to your functions.
5) Plastic body with multiple hand prints if being used with a cover.

Overall If you are looking for  a budget phone with amazing camera and battery this is your phone. But if you are too much into gaming configuration it is not going to entice you much.

I am comparing my galaxy M31 to a monster truck..Starting with exterior it have a huge build quality and the display is great compared to any other trucks in market. About the safety features, fingerprint sensor and face unlock is there to open this truck with a decent performance, rear camera with 64mp is great(macro wide etcüëå)and also the front camera 32mp give clear pictures and videos.Coming to engine side it works in any terrain without any delay and moreover no heating issues from engine side. Another top feature is the fuel capacity(6000mah battery) that it give a huge backup for long running. Overall it is the mega monster truck that going to defeat all other trucks in the market.

The reason I went for the M31 was because most reviews I adjudged it as "bang for the buck", and because Samsung is a trusted brand. I was familiar with the M series as my mother owns an M30s and after a week of using this phone, I am glad I made the decision to buy it.

Firstly, the most amazing thing about the M31 is the battery life. The battery comfortably lasts for more than 30 hours with moderately heavy use. The 15W charger keeps charging times fairly low. The M31 comes with Android 10 pre-loaded and the dark mode is something I really love! The performance is smooth, the UI is neat and clean, and the display looks crisp with good vibrancy. I really like the camera's performance in daylight and the quality of the images is quite sharp. However, I felt that low light photos are quite decent and could be better. The phone feels slightly heavier than the M30s because of the bigger battery but the difference is not very noticeable. I bought the Space Black version and while it looks classy, it does pick up fingerprints easily. I would recommend getting a case for that reason, even though the phone is quite comfortable to grip. Ergonomically, the buttons are well-placed and the fingerprint sensor works really well. I feel that on the whole, the phone is perfect for anyone looking for a durable device that can cover all the bases within the 15-20K range!

PROS
- Battery Life
- Daylight Camera
- Display
- Android 10 UI

CONS
- Night Shots
- Spammy notifications (can be easily disabled)

Samsung is constantly improving its level..on mid range phone..
If i talk about its...looks i think you may have to compromise a bit....but wait a min..there's a lot imp things rather than looks...

1.Camera‚úå üíñ----- Awesome camera quality, some says that there is no zoom feature in 64mp mode..yes it is right...but honestly speaking you dont require one, as the pic is so clear that...it really gives a stunning details.

2. Battery‚úåüíñ--awesome battery power of 6000mh...if you are a heavy user I am dam sure this is gonna be a very plus point...
One imp thing also...when I was buying this phone I got to know that it dosen't come with fast charging...and you have to wait 4 to 5hrs ...I was bit worried about that...but when I first charged my phone I was shocked to know that you can completely charge your phone in 60mins.

3.Fingerprint‚úåüíî---As usual you expect from Samsung it's awesome but...there is no..in display fingerprint sensor.

4.Displayüíñüíñ---Its super awesome as its SuperAmoled

5üòîüòîüòî.The thing  from which I am disappointed is only that it doesn't come with..Samsung Knox.üòî...but I think if you dont use this..then this phone is worth buying...but if you use this feature then shift to A-series...

6..üòâüòâA most imp thing is I am a Samsung user from last 6years I can assure you Samsung gives...more than what is shown in display...as many small features which we use in daily are generally not covered in Advertisements.

Guys , Please read this review before buying.

Samsung Galaxy M31 , Is very good looking smartphone  because of its glossy design. And because of it on the 2 day while using the phone there were scratches behind the back cover cause of its plastic back and on fringerprint sensor SO DON'T USE IT WITHOUT GOOD BACK COVER.

Samsung Galaxy M31 , Has AWESOME DISPLAY AND AWESOME CAMERA AND AWESOME BATTERY , Just beacuse of that I have bought this phone and it will never disappoint you in Display , battery and the camera department NEVER EVER.

Samsung Galaxy M31 , Has 9611 Processor which is equivalent to Snapdragon 660 and in between 675 , So the performance and speakers is Good not average and not the best. Even the charger of 18 watt is also GOOD but not the best in this price segment like 33 watts , 27 watts and 60 watts.

Samsung Galaxy M31 has good 32 MP Selfie camera which is THE BEST in this price segment but no EIS but its fine the selfies will blow your mind regarding the quality and the about the details , THE BEST SELFIE CAMERA.

So , to Conclude If you are looking for phone with Awesome Battery (6000Mah) , Awesome Display (Full HD +) , Awsome Camera's (Front 32 MP and Back 64+8+5+5+ MP) and decent performance of processor that could run PUBG in HD in Ultra settings smoothly then GO FOR IT.

I ordered this set on the first day and the delivery was amazing.

All the features of this phone are as advertised. The outer body is same as that of Galaxy M30s and M30. A little on the thick side due to 6000mAh battery.

Camera and battery life are excellent. The charger that came along with my set was white in colour.

Though, there is a bug in the phone (which is also found in Galaxy S10+) where the in-call speaker becomes your primary speaker. You can google about this bug. Hopefully, samsung will resolve it in the future updates.

Android 10 and one core is great. There are application like Bixby vision, AR emojis which is novel and interesting. Game launcher is also great in managing and organizing games.

Back cover is must as the back panel is shiny and smudges doesn't look great. Overall, the phone is great and price is reasonable.

I bought this mobile after using the previous version. i.e. M30. compare to previous phone, this phone has really good improvements. Pros of the phone is given below
1. Good battery life: Once fully charged I am using this phone for two days in normal conditions. Even if extensive gaming, battery longs for a full day
2. Big storage helps you in storing large number of photos and data without thinking
3. Amoled Screen gives you super fine experience while watching movies. I use mobile phone for watching movie even if my laptop has big screen only for its amoled screen expereince.
4. I have been using it for around a month now and it never struck or were never lagging.
5. I have played high graphic games like pubg. It supports well

However there is small con I noticced
1. Camera is good. But if you want low light photography, it is not upto the mark
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars

Value for money: Truly a value for money phone, as in this range you are getting everything you need.

Handiness: Great confidence on hold, I have always used phones without back covers and tempered glass. When I was buying this phone was thinking how will I manage this big phone but I was surprised as it is not slippery with a glass-like material which keeps your look on.

Camera: Great camera, I am not much mobile camera freak but when I used it I found it extremely great in the range.

Battery: It is fine, stays for 1.5 or 2 days was expecting it will last for more time but it is fine as there are many services which are continuously running so it's fine. And I was thinking that with 6000 mah battery it will be heavy but it's not as compared to other phones.

Sound: Quality of sound is very good whether it is speaker phone or as you can play music aswell and it's enough for a small room.

Screen: It is good, as it's a display and picture quality is great it shows real colours.

Backside: I liked this new material by Samsung which is used in the backside of this phone, as when you hold your phone, you will not feel it slippery and in this range it is great, the only thing I felt is it's backside cover quickly captures the dirt of hand and drops handprints etc.

I bought this phone because of the brand name "samsung". The first touch phone which I was used is Samsung(sliding type with touch). When I saw the add of this m31 I fixed this in mind.
  This phone is one of the most fantastic phone which I have ever seen. There is no words to say about The Batery life. It is Amazing. I can watch continuously 6 movies from 100%. Still the charge is 50% only . Even in my nonstop use I am getting 2.5 days battery life.
 Camera quality is also an amazing thing. Video quality  is like a Digital camera video. Photos are getting more and more clear during zooming.  Camera clarity is supeeeeerrr..
Fingerprint reader is excellent . It is too fast in unlocking using finger.
Ram is also fabulous.  No hang or delay. Sound quality is also super.
  From my point of view I have no negatives to say. This is an excellent phone . A huge facility in an affordable budget. I suggested this phone to 2 of my friends and the purchased too... so dear friends  pls choose this phone, u will not get this much features in any other phone. Others may have more features but they have no battery life and maximum 6 hrs back up. They have no brand value also. A small battery with more load can't use for more time. But our samsung is king. Pls try once u loved it u will not change ur mind.
  Still I am fall in love with samsung. Especially the battery life... thank you samsung team for giving this gift to us. ........

Before reviewing my samsung M31, I would like to share what I was actually seeking in a phone.
1. Best available battery life with fast charging
2. Good audio quality in video recording (for uploading acoustic guitar covers on YouTube)
3. A nice camera
4. Good enough processor for multitasking
5. Additional slot for expandable memory

This M31 from Samsung proves great on all fronts as per my requirement.
I am not a pro tech savvy who goes into the minute detail of every feature but would sum up the best I could experience in the last 5 days.

Camera Quality - My wife loved it more than her One plus 6T, pretty unbelievable though. Both front and rear (4 lenses) do their job quite well.
I video recorded a guitar cover and both picture and sound were upto the mark.

Battery life- one full charge lasted around 36 hours on a normal usage. 0-100% charge took around 2.5 hours ~ 150 minutes.

Gaming/Processor - Played Real cricket 20 and Gear club Racing, absolutely smooth.

Feel of the phone - Slightly bulky due to heavy battery but that's okay.

Most features similar to A51 but price almost 8k lower.
For someone like me who doesn't like to spend more than 15k on a phone, this might be the best option for you.

Review after 18 days uses of phone....

Only Display is really very good...5/5. Rest is worst dream....!!!

1. For full charging...it will take almost 3 hr. And heating a lot.... even you can't take a call

2. I have used mirroring function....initially worked smoth ...but after 50 minutes msg pop up mobile over heated it will shut down in 20 sec.....!!!  Note : battery % is 67 that time ...i have charged 100% after before starting mirroring function. (And it is not in charging).
3. Network is very bad....in my home almost no internet work and in office also. (Note : at same location my previous phone samsung on 7 working superb in internet.)
4. Phone call cut during talking with other.
5. Battery...draining very rapidely....it is only last for 12 to 14 hrs. On moderate uses. I have doubt on 6000 mH...!!
6. No zoom in 64 mp camera ...allthough rear camera is good but zoom is not attractive.
7.  Front camera ...really worst. In day light 3/5. But in night 1/5.

coming from a Samsung S7 Edge, I always wanted a phone with an awesome screen and a good battery life. This phone has them both. Its a bit heavier than the S7 Edge, but it is because of the 6000mah battery. My usage is average and I have never experienced and issue with his one. first charging I felt that the phone was heating but that has stopped after the first software upgrade. Awesome phone for a budget.

Pros
1. Excellent sAmoled display with stunning camera stills
2. Superb battery backup with 6000 mah
3. Blue light protector can be enabled to protect our eyes from harmful blue Rays emerge out of phones
4. Average processor but ok
5. Definitely a monster at this price range
Cons
1. Mobile gets heated up bit while using camera and other apps continously. Also, during software update
2. Full Mobile charging 1%-100% takes up to 2.5hrs for full charging as the charger is15w fast charger and not 25w charging like in other phones.

Overall rating 4 and 1 star less for above cons.

However,  an extraordinary mobile at this price range with a great brand SAMSUNG. Blindly,  go for it your budget is less than 15k

Most recommended over other phones.
Samsung M31 is an amazing phone with best features. It has 64 mega pixels camera(4 camera lenses) and fingerprint scanner at the back.
Its has best sound quality and clarity of its back and front camera is extraordinarily amazing.
This product has 64 gb internal storage which makes it better to store data.
It has various inbuilt apps which are necessary for day to day life.
The phone is a all rounder and it has strong and long battery life.
If you buy this phone during lockdown, you won't wait for lockdown to end rather you will pray for lockdown to increase üôÇ
Also, the wide screen enables you to view smaller objects better. It also has wide length screen shot as feature.
All of these features are available in brand like samsumg and at very reasonable price.
If you have high speed internet and if you are into business or if you are service provider and you want to use this phone for your work then it is very useful.
Please note these are my personal views based on my experience with this phone.
Also, you may gift this to your loved ones in order to experience the joy they feel after getting best technology.

Overall rating: 4/5

Been using this as my primary and only phone for around 3 months now. So far so good. I'll keep this short and to the point:

Pros:
1- smooth operation most of the time.
2- camera is really good. Good modes, good clarity. Sizable upgrade from my old moto g5s plus.
3- screen is good. No complaints.
4- audio quality is good but could have been better
5- battery is a genuine masterpiece. Lasts close to 2 days with very heavy usage and that's good enough for me.
6- happy that this is manufactured in India

Cons:
1- one major: occasional stutters. I don't know why but occasional app transitions stutter and it can get annoying. It's not very common but say I swap between WhatsApp and Reddit while typing something, there is a noticeable stutter. Hope this gets fixed.
2- fingerprint sensor could use some speed enhancements
3- facial recognition is in my opinion it's downside. I don't use it at all but it is very sloppy and inconsistent.

All in all, phone does my daily activities well and I don't have too many complaints, but I'd have liked it if they fixed the stuttering.

This is wrost phone of samsung brand. Because once a time samsung gives update a mobile. I am updating according to this after updating mobile screen looks blue and phone doesn't work. Any function of Mobile does not work it look like a dummy phone. I will call on customer service but he doesn't reply. So please customer don't buy this phone. If you're not believe please search on Google and YouTube also about this phone regarding update of this phone.

I was previously using moto g5s plus and this was selected after comparing many models in this price range. Using this for the past 4 days. Everything is fine, the clarity, sound, network, net speed, gaming. Heard many negative reviews for the processor used. But comparatively no drawbacks. You can definitely go for this model. And to mention, the SAR value is also very very less in the price range.
Battery life is only one day for full Internet usage and 3 hours of calls.

‚óèIt is an amazing phone which provides all-round performance whether we talk of battery(which is the biggest current battery available the 6000Mah)

‚óèIts camera is also incredible as compared to other smartphones in this range. As well as above mid-range smartphones also doesn't have such camera (64+8+5+5). It also has AR Doodle and AR Emojis.

‚óèNext is its performance which is obviously one very nice. While playing PUBG one can easily enjoy the game on high graphics for long without major overheating issues.

‚óèSamsung is known for its security and it has provided:-
&gt;Inbuilt McAfee antivirus protection,
&gt;Inbuilt VPN
&gt;Inbuilt WiFi protection.

Also the OS and UI are amazing and very handy.

It also has amazing split screen view which can even run in camera. And using pop-up view we can even open 5 APPLICATIONS at a time and even more.

Users may not be able to find all these features in first time but will obviously able to find them by viewing some tutorial video of this beast smartphone.

By using this smartphone one can surely say that this is a #MegaMonster

I feel the speaker is very poor compared to Redmi Note 7. Same song with full volume on Redmi Note 7 seems 50% more. Lags some important feature like remote sensor. Feels very delicate in hand, if your are rough handler pls get a case.
Device had old image at least 3 months, I had to install new updates which was around 600MB, even the April 1 security patch was not present even i purchased late in May. Even apps like Facebook, MS Office, Amazon etc were old and had to spend time in installing newer version before use. Also Comes with lot of Samsung apps which seems too much for a new phone, had to uninstall many of them, themes, wallpapers were all outdated
Android One UI has totally messed up the system setting/properties, its very difficult to find even the basic like default launcher (I love Microsoft Launcher so wanted to set it as home launcher).
I didn't feel battery is monster, its getting drained for me in a day with hot spot continuously on for more than 10 hrs. Also the charging cable is short, little bit more than 2 feet. The fast charging is also questionable  as it takes more than 3 hrs to fully charge.

Display - It is great. Great display of colours on this large screen. Score - 4.5/5

Camera - In videos image stabilisation is great. AI camera is also fine Night mode is fine. Problem is in colour correction feature when you want to see picture after zoom in. But that's not feature of mid range phone camera. So can overlook. Score - 4/5

Processor - Best in same ranges phone. Better geek bench score than snapdragon of same range. Score - 5/5

Handling - Heavy because their is 6000mah battery. Score - 3.5/5

Performance - Heating not properly tested till now. Overall it is fine under heavy usage also. Score - 4/5

Overall - 4/5
Recommended for under 20k budget. Best phone till march 2020.

Pros:
Good Battery life. After 100% charging I watched 5 movies (Indian) and used mobile data during my train journey. Battery lasted for 1.5 days.
Width: Width of screen compared to My old Redmi Note 3 is less and hence was easy to hold on.
I brought this phone for Battery and speed and I am totally satisfied.

Cons: In Sunlight brightness is not that g8t. My old Redmi Note phone I was able to watch videos without any issue.

Likes : The phone looks stunning and packs great features. The best part 6000 MaH battery which never feels bulky as the weight is balanced so nicely. The phone comes with all positive features in good price point. The UI is easy to use and no useless preinstalled apps like Realme phones. It makes all sense to buy this device with name tag Samsung.

Dislikes: The camera could have been better. The back panel gets scratches easily during daily use and finger prints are easily noticeable. But this might be the case with most of the phones in this price range.

Conclusion : The phone comes with all good configurations in a good price point and there is no need to spend extra for just higher processor speed. Of course the more you spend the more you get but remember all phone get old and new ones replaces them sooner.

Display : This is an oled panel, the colors are
  absolutely gorgeous. No flaws.

Battery: This is again a plus point in this
  device, I use my mobile phone for 2
  or 3 days once it's fully charged.

Camera : 64MP camera has some dynamic
  range issues but it is good for the
  price segment.

  128 MP camera performs good in
  daylight not in night.

  Macro lens is great.

  I usually take less selfies. But the
  selfie cam is pretty decent.

Charging time for this device is long because of the monster battery.

I do not play games on mobile phones. So can't say much about gaming performance.

I use a lot of applications concurrently and this device hasn't failed me yet.

I am very satisfied with device.

ite ¬∑ Reviewed on samsung.com
Well, the Samsung Galaxy M31 arrived in blue, the first thing I did was put the case that I had already prepared. The battery lasts a whole day if you hit it hard with games. It can be said that I was there all day, from when I woke up to falling asleep playing on my mobile and using it, and it lasted with a 10% battery surplus. The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything. The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaint with anything about this mobile and 64GB of internal storage, I do not even consider using the microSD slot since 64GB for me is enough, combining it with Google Photos is much more than enough for me.

Yes
Wen i purcahsed n ordered it i was very glad but wen i started use it, i had noticed these points:-
1.) Poor camera quality it showed its camera quality is 64 mp but back camera is like 5-8 ,mp n front is like 2 mp thats it...
2.) Bettery backup:- too much dessapointed it takes more than 3 hours to full charge and after 7-8 continue used it again came at 5% from 100%..

3.) Hanging issue:- sun can changes its direction but there is a strong connection i had noticed till now that is sumsung phones and its hanging issue..today after 3 months later i m very much sure nobody cannot improve sumsung's this issue..
4.,) less features in front video:- if u are photography lover then Do not purchase it bcoz it has very low front video quality...

5.) Yes u can use it as a memory card only coz it has good storage capacity, i purchased it6gb RAM and 128gb ROM so i can store so many video n audio in it which were ctreated by other good cameras or phone..
6.) No use of default programme or apps.

Likes:
1. Battery is good.
2. Camera appears good, though I haven't yet observed/used it keenly.

Dislikes:
1. The width of the handset is less than the optimal, making typing difficult due to the jumbling of alphabet in the portrait mode.
2. System heats up even during the simple applications.
3. It even hangs down while using simpler applications.
4. The overall software is not user friendly, making simpler things complex.
5. Not at par with Redmi phones. My Redmi Note 4 was better than it in many respects.
6. The seller is casual and not competent enough as the packaging was quite imperfect for the phone. The phone box was simply kept in a big cardboard box alongwith some other item, without any cushioning. The seller should be blacklisted by Amazon.
Redmi Note 8 Pro is a better option. I Regret for buying it.

Love it ! Easy to operate and seamless in handling multiple apps being open .. The cost is also very attractive . Would definitely recommend to anyone!  The battery life us very long and gives me enough time to recharge . The fingerprint lock is fantastic.......no one else can open it .  During lockdown all  dishes i have made I took  endless photos and the dishes look almost better than real :)

Though I was apprehensive to buy this phone after using my previous One Plus 5 for the last 3 yrs yet I  must say that this by far the best decision I have made in the month! #M31 is a monster rightly as highlighted in their ads constantly. Few of my friends were chosen to give the first reviews and I am glad I believed them!

The 64 mega pixel camera is fantastic and has a good AI attached to it because it can differ food objects and nature pretty vividly. The finger print sensor at the back is quickest indeed. And the battery life is super amazing too. Though the charging scene is a bit slow but it's okay to give that time off to the phone once in two days.

I chose the 128 Gb option since I have a bundles of data to carry and the phone is clearly standing up to my expectations in the last 10 days.

Good mobile with superb display and great speed. Camera is best in sunlight. But not good in dark. Specially if you use slow motion camera indoor it is not clear. Sound quality is superb. Audio and video quality is also best. Display is good super Amoled. Battery back up is great. Average use 2 days battery life.

Satisfied...very good performance and as expected..Amazon prompt delivery appreciable
This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.

My Samsung Galaxy M31 arrived in ocean blue color.

The battery lasts a whole day if you hit it hard with games. It can be said that I was there all day, from when I woke up to when I fell asleep playing on the mobile and using it and it lasted with a 10% battery surplus. No doubt, great battery life!

The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything.

The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Decent camera quality!

Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaints with anything about this mobile and 128GB of internal storage, I did not even consider using the microSD slot since 128GB is more than enough for me.

Technical errors experience:
1. Contact details though saved correctly shows/display the 'work position' instead of 'name'. Refer attached screenshots.
2. Though preference is set for SIM1, you get both options before dialing in (making you to force remember which sim to be used)
3. Zoom in &amp; out mode camera picture quality is strange. Refer attached photo.
Selfie camera is better than the rear cameras when it comes to photo results.
4. Battery charge time is very high as it takes 4 hrs to charge and battery drain is also quite fast (lasted for a day only though use is intermittent for internet scrolling, no games nor much video viewing).
5. Samsung India not answering queries on technical issues.

Other apps not used much so will come back to update the feedback again.

I'm very much happy with the quality of phone samsung come up with .
But I m much disappointed with the people's I don't know wheather they are from samsung or any third party agency of samsung  , calling me every day and forcing to write review, in addition of that they are arguing for the same , that's too much pathetic.
What's wrong !!! Hallo !

That's not sales , that's not how it works ,people's are writing their review if they really feels good , you cannot force !!
 If you do so it will always have a bad effect for one's who really developed this nice gadget.
That's  very wrong gesture just to get catch few review to increase sales . But believe me that may have wrong effect too..

Like I rated 2 star for a such nice phone which  deserves at least 4 star ....

Pros:
Currently the best budget phone on market imo

Camera quality is excellent for a phone of this price.

Excellent display

Game performance is good. Had no problems running games like PUBG in high graphics.

Excellent battery life. Currently writing this review I haven't charged the phone for 2 days and still have around 40% charge despite using it frequently.

The music quality while using headphones is amazing, especially due to Dolby Atmos.

Cons:

Sound quality from the phone speaker could be better.

A lot of pre-installed apps was not to my liking, though a few could be uninstalled.

The icons look generic and all the good themes have to be bought through the Samsung store, or you can use other launchers.

I changed to Samsung M31 from One Plus 3, which I was using for 3.5+ years. This phone was a major upgrade for me. Quad- camera, super Amoled screen and humongous battery are the super cons of the phone. Being a non-gamer, I have no issues with the performance. But, overall the phone is absolute value for money. I would like to add a few cons, which I think should be taken into consideration while buying this:
1. No dash charging. Having used One Plus for quite a long, charging the phone becomes a bit painful for me. It takes close to 3 hrs to fully charged from zero. But, having a 6000 mah battery, it takes a lot to time to get drained as well. I was able to use this phone more than 24 hours on a single charge with quite heavy usage and screen time.
2. The speaker could have been a bit louder. It's not bad, but could have been better.
3. The phone is not meant for heavy gamers.
4. Camera UI could be improved a lot and could me made more clean and clutter-free.

Worst battery life, It takes 5 hours to charge 100%, Battery Drains in 12 hours only for normal usage, Decreasing Customer Faith, There is nothing  correct details regarding  battery as it shows in the phones features, Amazon Also Takes Too much  Time For Inpection And Its Technician Are Also Fraud, It is So Hard To Replace might be impossible And there is no return or refund policy, So it's better not to Buy It on Amazon and save your money.

The phone is anytime worth the price. The best part about this phone is its fast charging feature and battery backup, which is the most imp key factor in today‚Äôs world.
Camera is really good and the macro feature and super slow motion works very well.
It packs a quad camera setup at the back with best photo quality in the daylight.
The AMOLED display is crisp. Performance wise the phone is best in its range
The phone is overall the best phone in range of 15-20k.

I have been OnePlus user and then an iPhone user. I was slightly hesitant to ditch these 2 brands as I found them to be highly reliable and user-friendly.
After lot of research, I then finally bought Samsung M31 and it's been 2 months now. I feel I made the right decision to switch to Samsung.
The overlaid OS is awesomely smooth and the graphic animations are pretty evolved to the extent of iOS. The camera is also top notch and build quality is pretty tough.
The battery easily lasts me for 2 days with moderate usage.
Overall an excellent phone for a power user and camera lover.

I am fully satisfied, as of now!
This Phone meets all my requirements to the fullest.
Batter gives me 2 days backup üëç
Camara is awesome, more than I need. Still exploring the features of camara, so much to do for a YouTuber üëç
The Biometric "Fingerprint Reader" is very sensitive and better than the previous phone, picks up instantly. üëç
It's a new launch &amp; I was worried when I bought.
Value for the price of the product.
Samsung has really lived up to my expectations!!!

The device is excellent
It gives u a premium feeling
The display is jus awesome
The amoled display is so nice
Very useful for the multimedia consumers
The front camera is not so good
The back camera is excellent
The  battery life is awesome
Not soo good with gaming performance though
Pubg like games will struck
U have to play it in mid to low settings
The charging time is more coz of the 15w charger, it's kinda old model

Conclusion:
If u are a multimedia consumer who watch movies and videos alike, and who are a battery fan, and would love to use the back camera much
Then this is THE BEST MOBILE FOR YOU

If u want more performance oriented phones for gaming purposes, and a selfie addict and don't care abt bat display, then this phone will disappoint you... I would suggest u to go for other phones

But other than that, overall the phone is great...

The product is handy, the display is very good and so is the battery.
But don't expect too much from the 6000 mAH battery. The features are great and the sensors work good.

Sound:
Sound is loud but clear. You wont be needing to attach it to a speaker when indoors. There is a special Dolby Effect for speakers which you probably should give a try. It is great.

Biometrics:
Phone is supported with Finger print scanner and Face unlock. And these are surprisingly fast as compared to its prior versions.

Apps:
Most apps are supported but some utility app like Samsung Pay etc is not yet supported by the phone. Please work on it.

Gaming:
So far so good. I have tried out pubg and Asphalt. The games work flawless and phone doesn't heat up as expected.

9.5/10 for overall performance
10/10 at this price range

You can definitely go forward and get your hands on it.

Performance wise the phone is very good. Touch and fingerprint lock works within fraction of seconds. I had always been a BlackBerry fan for almost 10 years but switched to Samsung and am very satisfied with it. At 17000 rupees there couldn't be any better mobile than this.
Battery life - 6000 mah battery has got you extra life if you keep your mobile data off then battery doesn't go down 20 in 70 hours. With all function enabled 1 35-40 hours you need to recharge.

Gaming experience- not a very used to game on the phone but even if you are It won't disappoint you.

Camera quality- camera is also good at this budget.

5. No earphones with mobile handest.  :(

At first glance, it is hard to distinguish between the Samsung Galaxy M30s (Review) and the Galaxy M31 from the front. Both smartphones sport big 6.4-inch displays with waterdrop notches, which Samsung calls Infinity U displays, The bezels aren't thin but are acceptable for the price. Just like with other M series smartphones, Samsung has used plastic in the construction of the Galaxy M31. The earpiece is sleek and sits right above the display in the frame of the smartphone.

Pick the Galaxy M31 up and it feels comfortable to hold in the hand. The sides are slightly curved which helps with grip. Samsung has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right of the device. The power button is easy to reach but the volume buttons could have been positioned better. On the left is the SIM tray which did not sit perfectly flush on our review unit. The Galaxy M31 has a 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port, and speaker at the bottom. The top only has the secondary microphone.

When you look at the back of the Galaxy M31, you'll see some changes. The camera module is similar to that of the Galaxy M30s but it now packs a fourth camera. Next to this is the fingerprint scanner which was comfortable for us to reach while holding the smartphone.

The Galaxy M31 packs in a big 6,000mAh battery and weighs 191g makes the device feel a little heavy. Samsung has thankfully bundled a 15W charger in the box which should help keep charging times down. The company offers the Galaxy M31 in two colours, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We had the Space Black variant for review, and it picked up fingerprints and smudges very easily. There is no case in the box, so you may want to buy one.

Samsung Galaxy M31 specifications and features
The spec sheet of the Galaxy M31 looks similar to that of the Galaxy M30s. It sports a 6.4-inch AMOLED display with a full-HD+ resolution. It also has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection which should keep it from picking up scratches too easily. The display has good viewing angles and is legible when outdoors. There are two colour profiles to choose from, and you can also change the white balance.

Samsung has retained the Exynos 9611 SoC from the Galaxy M30s. This is an octa-core processor with four performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.3GHz and four efficiency Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. For graphics, it has the Mali-G72 GPU. You get 6GB of RAM and a choice between a 64GB storage variant and a 128GB storage variant for Rs. 15,999 or Rs. 16,999 respectively. However, Samsung is offering a Rs. 1,000 discount which brings the prices down to Rs. 14,999 and Rs. 15,999 respectively. The duration of this offer has not been specified.

Samsung has bumped up RAM on the Galaxy M31 compared to its predecessor which should give it some leverage while multitasking. We did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps however big apps do take slightly longer. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and we did not find ourselves waiting for an app to load all over again.
The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. We enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which should let you stream full-HD content.

We ran our usual benchmarks on the Galaxy M31. In AnTuTu, it managed to score 191,981 points which are higher than the Galaxy M30s did. The Galaxy M31 also scored 348 and 1,247 respectively in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests. As for graphics benchmarks, the Galaxy M31 managed 41fps in GFXBench T-Rex and 8.9fps in GFXBench Car Chase

I have been using this phone for over 2 months now. The major reason why I went for this model was its battery. After putting the phone to mild-high usage everyday (amdist the lockdown), the battery safely lasted just over a day (~26-28 hours). I use many services concurrently - Bluetooth, Data, GPS, Hotspot. So the battery drain in my device would be faster. In any normal use pattern, this battery can easily last a day and half. As far as charging is concerned, there are a lot of discussions online regarding the charging time for this model, as the charger comes with a 15W power capacity. From my experience, I would say, it charges fast untill it reaches a certain threshold afterwhich the charging becomes slow. So, you can expect your phone to buff up to around 40% battery in next to no time, but if you would like to completely charge the device, then leaving it plugged in as you sleep might be your best option
Another great thing about Samsung M31 is its Camera. The front camera has 32MP and takes very beautiful selfies. In the Live Focus mode, you can blur off the background and obtain a high aperture-esque effect in your photos. The Macro mode is also very powerful and would be suited for subjects with high detail per unit area - an insect, a flower, a fruit etc. As a consequence, you will have to go up close to the subject to really appreciate the power of the Macro mode. This is made slightly difficult as the camera doesnt auto focus in the macro mode. But with Macro mode, you almost never get auto focus anyways. The main 64 MP camera is also quite sharp. Sometimes, you may be tempted to use the 64MP over the Macro Mode because of the quality the 64 MP camera packs in. I have not been able to step out and click landscape pictures using the 64 MP back camera, but if household images are to stand any testimony, this 64 MP beast must rival a mid range DSLR easily. If you download Lightroom from the App store (which is a free app by Adobe), you can get going with your new hobby and have some good impressionable snaps to show off. If you get used to these three camera modes, the other modes becomes largely redundant. Food mode and Night mode are probably helpful (Especially in low light)
Only point where Samsung could have done better is the finishing of the product. The images put up on the website flatters the actual product. The back cover is a poly carbonate finger print magnet. It would be worth your money to invest in a back cover (As the package doesnt come with one included in it). Samsung has a lot of preloaded apps but you can uninstall most and for the ones which you cannot uninstall, you always have the option to mute notifications. The processor is a new chip and would obviously pale in comparison against the Qualcomms and Realteks, but with 15k you can only expect so much. I do not play large graphic intensive games on my device, so would not be able to tell the performance in those situations. But the phone holds itself in modest esteem when I tried Brawl Stars, Clash Royale, Plants Vs Zombies etc. Smooth and no problems. Media playback has also been satisfactory and the large screen really does help the resolution. Bear in mind, that for some videos on Youtube/Netflix/Prime, you wont be able to go the entire length of the screen. If you drag and stretch the video, you might fill the screen, but loose out on some details along the edges.
All in all, this megamonster does all it promises and would really qualify as a great Value for Money option. If Battery and Camera is your thing, go for this product with your eyes closed!

I bought this the day it launched. The very moment it was available for sale and got it at an affordable price of ‚Çπ14999, delivered the same day via Amazon Prime. Its been almost 15 days of heavy use now

What i liked:
-Amoled screen is sharp and crisp at displaying. No faulty viewing angles. Drop notch is super stylish and gives a flagship look to the device. Videos can be cropped to fit by the finger pinching out action. i have never seen Adaptive Brightness work so well in any phone.
-Fingerprint sensor is easy to reach at the back below the camera. Quick unlocking and Smart Unlock works well. Face unlock is accurate and works well too.
-Quad Camera setup is one of the sleekest cameras and positioning looks fabulous. The camera is quick to focus, great depth, the 64MP produces sharp images with a focus on the smallest details too. It has features like Pro, Hyperlapse, SlowMo, SuperSlowMo, Panorama, Night mode, Macro (wide), Bixby Vision, AR emoji, Food, 4k video and so much more. The front camera is better than what it looks like. It has perfect positioning, quick to focus and great attention to detail too. Overall, the cameras themselves make this phone worth a buy. Not just better in this range of phones but also than most flagship phones in 40-50k range.
-Android 10 &amp; One UI2.1 are both very clean, precise and extremely easy to use. If you're on any os below 9, this will be a great upgrade.
-The biggest reason i bought this was the 6000mAh monster battery, it is not surprising that they do deliver their promise in this case too. The battery does not exhaust easily. Being a heavy user this battery, after charged fully, lasts around 2.5 days for me. The 15W type C charger that comes in the box takes about an hour to charge it from 0 to 100%.
-There is one external speaker towards the side of the charging port which produces clean and moderately loud sound. Dolby Atmos Sound is also an upgrade if you are looking for a surround sound experience. towards the other side of the charging port, you have a 3.5mm headphone jack.
-The Samsung Exynos 9611 processor lives upto its name. It is faster than i had expected it to be. Also, there are separate slots for memory and 2 sim cards which is a major pro.
-The phone in hand feels very light, despite its huge battery. The Ocean Blue colour looks sophisticated and might give the black variant competition.
-The box has a 15W fast charger with cable, user manuals, ejection pin.

What I didn't like
-It might sound stupid but there is nothing that i did not like about the m31. Maybe they could have provided a headphone in the box but given the features of the phone at such a low price range, that is understandable. Other than that, the phone has delivered to all the claims that it made and I think it is one of the best phones i have owned so far. Great competition in this range. Highly Recommended.

I'm reviewing this phone after 3 weeks of usage. The phone is good if you are using it for normal usage. The 6000 mah battery can give you more than 24+ hrs if you just listen to music, use social media, and click pictures. here are the pros and cons:
Pros:
1) Big Battery: can give 1+ days using medium usage and 30+ hours if it's very light usage
2) Nice display: sAmoled display is great and its the best in this price range
3) Daylight photography nice: the colors are very accurate.
4) Nice sound: it has a single speaker but the sound quality is nice
5) The UI i.e One  UI 2.0 is very clean and nice to use.
Cons:
1) Uses Exynos 9611 chipset which is not best when compare to snapdragon 712 or MediaTek G90t.
2) Camera2api is limited you don't get level 3 support so no Gcam available
3) The stock camera is nice for daylight photography the colors are nice but during the night the quality is very bad the night mode does not work as well as it is supposed to do. Samsung can improve this is the upcoming update if they want its just a software issue.
4) The updates are very less in Samsung smartphones. The phone is having a February security Patch. This can also improve the security patch updates  can be frequent.
5) One more con is the details in the photos are missing due to the aggressive noise cancellation algorithm used by Samsung./when you zoom into photographs the details are missing. But in 64mb mode the details are present but it can also be done in 16 MB photo also.
6) The battery takes approx 3 hrs to charge in spite of fast charging which is only 15 watt i.e adaptive fast charging as it is called by Samsung. If you use are charger having more than 15 watts rating it will still only take 15 watts of power from that charger. Samsung must allow the usage of more than 15-watt charger via software update if possible because to charge such a big battery in less time at least 30-watt charging should be allowed

Conclusion: if you are not a gamer and use your phone just to listen to music, click pictures, and use Facebook, Instagram, etc then this is the phone for you. You get a Samsung brand phone for such a price point with sAmoled display 64 MB camera, nice audio. There are some issues related to camera which can be fixed via updates like full camera2api support, improved night mode, and so little camera improvements and the frequent security updates should be provided.
Overall: 8.5/10
Camera: 8/10
Sound: 9/10
Display: 10/10
Performance: 9/10
Battery: 10/10

Received this from Amazon a week back. Here is review after a week's usage -
1) The build quality of phone certainly ferls premium for this budget.
2) Display is where I believe this device will surely outclass it's rivals. 6.4inch SAMOLED screen with FHD+ resolution looks gorgeous and colours pop out brilliantly. Even in direct sunlight I have no issues in seeing the content.
3) Camera quality is top notch even in low lighting conditions whether it be 64MP Rear cams or 32MP
Front, I infact felt the front camera better than my Galaxy Note 10+ in certain lighting conditions. Plus you get quad camera setup with ultra wide, macro and 4th cam for depth sensing, slow motion, 4k video shoot at 30fps.
4) Battery life is Terrific, 6000MAH lasts easily 2 days on a moderate usage with 4g Calls, WhatsApp,  fee gaming, browsing and youtube content. Icing on the cake is it comes with a 15w fast charger which is superb.
5) Biometrics works just fine wether it's fingerprint or face unlock, accurate and fast.
6) Best part is it comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack which is quite a feature these days. Although Samsung could have provided a headphone with it which I feel is a mandate, but nevertheless the prescene of 3.5mm jack won't feel you sad about it.
7) Internal 6gb of ram and 64gb of storage for base model is quite decent and performance is is quite good. It's fast, there is no lag in any apps. Morever you can expand it via external micosd card upto 1TB.
8) It has an inbuilt FM Radio which was quite surprising feature. There is one bottom firing speaker which ain't stereo but it's quite loud. Can't expect everything at this pricepoint. Moreover you get Dolby Atmos feature as well so mulimedia experience is quite good.
9) It comes with android 10 and Samsung UI 2.0 which I think Samsung has done quite a good job balancing the design, features &amp; usability where I think it's close to being the best software experience on an android. It's easy and clean to use.
10) Overall a well made device with a good usable feature set and good performance, great cameras, terrific battery and software experience. Would highly recommend it as one of the purchasing options while buying a phone in this pice range.

Giving this review after 4 days of use. I was the ios user but now I am realizing that spending too much on phones which people used to change in around two years is a waste of money. Hence shifted to Android (Galaxy M31).
Firstly I was thinking about Redmi Note 9 Pro Max, but since it is a product of Chinese Company, so stooped there only. Too much Patriotism :).

Pros-
- The phone looks beautiful.
- The display is awesome, played some 4k videos from youtube. Screen quality is really awesome. It also has Blue light filter functionality. You can schedule the same as per your need.
- The overall performance is good. No heating. Played general games (NFS etc) and it worked really well
- 6000 Mah battery is really big enough for me (comparing with iPhones). Lasts for almost 1.5 Days with general use.
- 64 GB storage is sufficient and you can expand it to 512 GB with an external card.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with the phone. The phone came with a 30% charge. Charged fast.
- The camera is good. The macro camera works perfectly fine. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.
Since I am not a photographer, this is more than enough for me.
- Fingerprint and Face recognition is good (Don't want to compare with apple.)

Cons -
- The phone is a little heavy and not slim (But it doesn't look bulky, it really looks awesome)
- There were some claims that it takes 160 minutes to charge from 0-100% which is wrong. This phone takes around 3.50 hours for full (0-100) recharge.
- There is no earpiece provided by Samsung.

Overall this Phone is really a must buy in this price range. Don't go with negative reviews.

I have seen some reviews where people are saying the camera is not good. It is not justifiable to compare its camera with DSLR or any other high-end phones (For example iPhone 11) as
Your DSLR can not make calls and much more other things what this phone can
and Other high-end phones like iPhone 11 don't come in 16000 Rs.
The camera quality is really good and you can go for it.

This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Good:

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
- Received next day by 11 AM !

Not So Good:

- Not that thin, but ok.
- Doesn't have Samsung Dex
- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.
- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)
- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.

Feedback

- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.
- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.

Go for it without any doubt.

Writing this review after using this phone for more than a month as my primary device.

Not less than a Flagship phone at a very comfortably affordable budget. Slim, light weight and attractive desgine. Premium to hold and use. The screen is amazing and produces amazing colours.
Pros :

1. First of all amazing 64 megapixel camera shoots amazing and highly detailed pictures with amazing colours.. ultra wide angle camera of 8 megapixel is too good for landscape and nature photography.
5 Mp Macro-camera and 5 Mp depth camera adds a special touch to this quad canera device..
Front facing 32 Mp camera captures the true skin colour in almost every situations.
The most amazing feature is its night camera which captures images better or almost equal to some professional cameras.
It also offers 4k video and slo-mo on both i.e. front and rear camera and ultra slo-mo on back camera.

2. 6000 mah battery is more than enough and lasts almost around 26-27 hours approx (am not a gamer or a heavy user but "always on display" is continuously on.)

3. Amazing sound, loud, crisp and clear. Clear voice on calls.

4. No heating problem while on charge or on call or while surfing internet for longer hours.

5. Nice on screen animation and colour reproduction.

Cons :

1. The thing which matters the most is there are not much options in the PRO MODE.
2. The keyboard lags a little bit and takes around 2 minutes to resume back.
3. If you turn on the speakers while on call, you won't be able to hear anything the other person is saying from the other side.
4. When you creat folders on the app screen and add apps on it, the apps would come out every time you restart the phone.
5. There could have been more features in the phone as compared to other brands in this price segment like locks and security, dual apps, IR Blasters etc etc.

Overall am quite satisfied with this smartphone as i wanted a camera centric phone with a large battery and this is absolutely that device.

best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India seller. I ordered on the first day 5th March 2020 of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

I have wanted to buy this phone ever since I saw it would be launching. However, I did wait for my 2nd PU exams to be over and when I checked back it was already out of stock. And later, when I did order it again my order got cancelled due to corona virus. I had to wait almost 2 months and finally got it gifted for my birthday. Those two months I spent heavily researching about the phone and it's competition. And honestly there were so many incidents when I decided to choose another phone. But my dad wasn't okay with me choosing Chinese brands.
A piece of advice if you do buy it.. Please charge the phone completely before using it for the first time. It's really helpful. I've read many reviews here and everyone who found it faulty probably didn't charge it to 100% before first use (It does gets heated the first time. Don't worry about it.) Now to the review. Waiting two months eagerly for this... my expectations were as high as it could be and my phone did meet it a great extent.
Fingerprint sensor is great though sometimes it does not recognize on the first try. But again for the budget it's pretty good.
The display has to be the biggest pros of the phone. I was so obsessed with it I didn't even want to use a screenguard XD. It is very smooth and videos look great on it.
The back of the phone also looks very attractive despite what I've read about it. It does get fingerprints all over it but nothing that can't be rid of.
Face unlock I had to try just for the review and it is pretty good. (Keep in mind I tried it only for a few minutes, just a couple tries)
Battery life is really good. I usually binge watch TV shows on my phone(10 hours approx.) and it would last for a day and a half. When I tried gaming, I didn't find any freezing or lagging. But the battery does start reducing a little more quickly ( It would still last for the whole day) and sometimes heats up but nothing to be worried about.
Coming to the camera, the default camera is 16MP and you'll have to change it to 64MP and you can't zoom in using 64MP. Also it takes up more space. But the camera quality is pretty awesome. However the video and every other mode are in 16MP. The front camera default is 16MP too I presume, and ultrawide front camera is 21MP and you can change it to 32MP. The front camera is great too. However I don't recommend the phone to hardcore photo enthusiasts considering it might not meet your expectations. But keeping the budget in mind I give it 5 stars. The video mode is good however the super steady mode is very grainy.(I'm not sure how exactly it works yet). And the super slo-mo video can only be used in daylight for best results. Photos in lowlight are not the best. But there is a flash option for front camera where the screen goes bright white during a shot and it compensates really well. I was happy with most of the camera features but it isn't the best being a photo enthusiast myself. It still does a great job nonetheless. The performance is amazing. There are times apps start glitching but it's probably the app's fault and not the phone's.
Talking about storage the system takes up 16GB and other 4GB gets used up while setting up. You basically get 108GB give or take as your storage(For 128GB variant). It's been almost 11 days since I got the phone and it's done a great job of impressing me and my family. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a budget friendly smartphone. And to those trying to cut off Chinese products.Overall I have had a pretty awesome and exciting experience with it so a five star rating. Totally would recommend.

I'll start by saying this is the best Birthday gift I have purchased for myself, also my First Samsung phone.
I will start with the my experience with the phone so far.

Speed:
- Great speed and touch response and Apps opening time is amazing
- Phone boot up is quite fast
- Fingerprint and face ID is very fast compared to In-display fingerprint
- Gaming experience is good too

Camera:
- Attached the shots, see the amazing close up and night mode
- Super amoled display shows the  best possible colors
- Steady camera, till not I haven't got a single blur picture or out of focus, which is amazing
- Image process is impressive, no time delay in capturing and saving the images

Looks:

Trust if if anything matters the most to me is the looks of the phone, this phone looks amazing and quite attractive
One small issue - a bit slippery, but a cover would take care of it. I'm not a cover fan though, I like the phone the way it is.

Features:
Fast Charging
Android 10 One UI2
Memory Card slot
Best - 3.5 mm Audio Jack
Dolby Atmos sound
6000 mAh - more than 48 hours with moderate usage and about day and half with extreme usage
Charting time is about 30-45 minutes
NO ADs - The best part
Sound: Quite loud, over calls as well on speaker side. That's what I love

To be honest, I was so worried about transferring the data from old phone to new one, but found out the Samsung Smart switch app, within minutes every single thing(means everything) from old phone to new got transferred, absolutely had nothing else to do apart from installing the apps.
Assistant is also quite nice.
For me some things were hard to find in the new UI as I was used to other versions, but it has everything that other smartphones are offering and even better than others in the same price segment
Samsung Members is the place I found to be very helpful if anyone has any questions or issues to be discussed about the phone.
The only thing that didnt impress me is the Dialer, its split in 3 parts (Keypad/Recent/Contacts), maybe i'm used to the one page Dialer thats why.
Also the Notification menu, its quite big, I think considering the phone size its designed this way by Samsung.

I'm glad I chose a great birthday gift for myself, I sure am satisfied with the product. Thanks

This phone is overall good for its camera quality, battery backup and its processor. Camera quality is great compared to other phones of this price range. Processor is very fast, as you can open up 4-5 apps in pop up window and the phone dosen't even lag a bit, not to mention gaming- smoothest gameplay you could ever get in this price range.
All that aside the best feature is its battery backup, with a full charge your phone will easily last about 2-3 days over its normal day to day usage.
Fast charging dosen't satisfy much as it takes around 2 hours to charge from 30-100%.
If you're ordering online, make sure to add to cart a tampered glass and back cover along with it, as these are not included in the box, also make sure its of good quality becausethe glass may brake if the phone hits the ground with the corner side.
In short, its an awesome phone and you'll definitely love it...

The Samsung M31 is a power packed performer not only among it's equivalent price range smartphones but comparative to all high end phones available in the market today.
1. Overall Handling is quite satisfying. With an Amoled Screen and a good resolution perfect for binge watching. You can switch between Vivid and Natural colours though (don't know why it comes in vivid default).
2. Has a 64 MP rear camera with ultra wide and depth however as anyone would have a nick for wanting the best, there still is room for improvement.
3. Comes with Face recognition and Finger print scanner, however there is a fraction of a second's lag while unlocking the phone. Recognition does get better with more use.
4. Has an inbuilt Optimiser in the UI with anti-theft features to clear up memory,check battery usage and scan through an inbuilt antivirus. So that is an addition, however a third party antivirus should still be used as back up.
5. The smartphone boasts of a 6000mAH mega battery and it lives up to the figure with 9-10 hrs of battery if used continuously and upto 2 days with normal to minimal use(Frankly speaking I gifted the phone to my mother and was surprised to see it working at 28%, the day after it was charged..also it was charged in the evening around 5 pm...so still not 2 days). The Charger supports fast charging but I wouldn't compare it to One Plus' dash charging as it would take upto 150 mins to reach full charge on M31.
Eventually I did want to buy one more for myself,but there already is one M31 in the family.
A great buy.

The phone is really awesome and worth to spend 16k on. It is very handy, looks nice (back should have been given some gradient design), and very light weight. Operation is very smooth. It is so user friendly that it assists searches, it has settings for almost everything you see on the phone which means you need not compromise with how it asssits you. The best thing I liked is its focus mode which is a must have in any student's phone...also we can create our own mode where we can decide which all applications we must be able to use while having a me time.6 gb + 128 gb is too much to get for 16k from such a reputed brand like samsung. I have been using this phone for past 3 days and it has not made me disappointed. This phone is made for normal users where all your needs are met. Voice quality is good on call, speakers are not so loud,battery backup is awesome with 6000 mah. Options to delete screenshots after sharing was another awesome feature. My gallery used to be flooded with unwanted screenshots and now its solved. Its size is also good. Enough for reading pdfs and watching movies and won't hurt your thumb after long use. I have a suggestion that the pack could have included a back cover also as most of midrange phones comes with backcover with it. Battery takes about 2 and a half hours to get fully charged from nearly 0. Phone comes with android 10. Photos taken are okay. I'm not a photography person. I'm really happy with my choice... Samsung has not disappointed me this time also. I happily suggest Samsung M31 to any normal user.

Performance, Display and Battery: Overall speed is good. But touch is not respond properly, like small buttons or moving buttons while playing games. Display resolution is not upto the mark, easily get to know while playing 1080p videos. Battery life is excellent. If you are not play games or paly much videos, would have use 2 days.

Camera: 64MP is for gimmick, that is not up to the mark. Take a picture and zoom it, pictures will be blur. Redmi note 8 48MP far better than this. Day light camera is avg but  low light quality too poor. Macro camera quality is good. Overall camera is can say 2 out of 5 star.

Would have decrease 2k or 1k in a price. But overall not bad.

Newly purchased samsung m31 quite satisfied with the phone. In fact, loving this #Megamonster

Things to know before buying

M31 offers One UI 2.0 (based on Android 10)¬†which is out-of-the-box.
A smooth Android skin, it works well on most Samsung smartphones and has a few nifty features ‚Äì¬†Always-On Display,¬†Ultra Data Saving, and¬†Dual Messenger¬†‚Äì that add to the package.

6.4 full hd Super Amoled display is just Amazing which I couldn't find in other phones in this segment. It gives an enriched experience while watching Netflix or prime. It supports 4K as well.

The colours are vibrant and punchy and the text is sharp and  the sunlight legibility is also quite good.

It has a 6000mah mega monster battery which I love the most. Easily it last for 1.5 or 2 days. And it takes 2.5 hours or less for full charging. Trust me I use my phone for around 12-15 hours a day. With this monstar battery, phone doesn't seem heavyweight. Well done! Samsung

The Samsung Galaxy M31 consists of a¬†64-megapixel primary sensor, an¬†8-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, a¬†5-megapixel macro sensor, and a¬†5-megapixel depth camera, which produce great results in day-time. The images captured by the 64-megapixel sensor have good details and great dynamic range
32 MP selfie camera is amazing.
It supports slow motion, live focus as well
 Overall phone is awesome. If looking for a phone under 15000, I would suggest this is best phone in the market with samsung brand value.

The Samsung Galaxy M31 is decently and simply designed when it comes to budget smartphones. There isn‚Äôt too much going on but whatever we have on our plates is still eye-pleasing. When I first held the Galaxy M31, it appeared quite bulky. But as it adjusted to my hands I got to know it was lightweight after all. Made up of polycarbonate, the device comes in two colour options: Ocean Blue and Space Black. I got hold of the black colour and loved the classic black tone of the device, which can never go wrong for a smartphone or anything painted in black. Although the smartphone doesn‚Äôt have a glass back, it doesn‚Äôt come last in the design race and offers us a sleek, not-so-cheap, and sturdy design.
The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, which is known as the Infinity-U display. The name arises from the presence of a waterdrop notch. It is protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is slightly disappointing. The smartphone has a number of display features, which are mostly in the case of every Samsung smartphone. There is Adaptive Brightness, Blue light filter, Dark mode, a choice between Vivid and Natural display colours, Always On Display, Accidental touch protection, Touch Sensitivity and more. While all the display features prove to be helpful, the accidental touch protection doesn‚Äôt really provide any protection as the device could easily be accessed accidentally.
Finally I will suggest others to buy this mobile because of the excellent functionality and features

After 5 days of use
Pros
1) prompt finger print and face authentication. Face recognition is too fast.
2)Camera quality natural. Quard camera +64 Mega pixel is the best.
3) Gigantic battery life. With all day use of netflix and toutube video, tuning songs , games..
4)it has real HD quality display , suitable for streaming netflix and youtube videos.
5) i feel it has light body due to fibre back cover.
6)Above all has the brand logo of samsung..

Cons
1)I thought that there was disturbance and noise while phone call.. and i was annoyyed but figured out that it was the network problem of sim operator..
So the conclusion is no cons yet

Previously i have used Samsung M30S which i lost just before lockdown and unable to order new phone for next almost 50 days. The day government allowed order for phone i ordered this phone because I have already used M30s i have observed how that performed in term of battery (1.5 -2 days), camera, display etc.
Now M31 is latest version in the sequence  of m30s with better camera quality and display.
I am very happy to get phone in this range from brand like Samsung.

Best mobile ever used by me. Main difference is the display that is just outstanding. Samoled display feels like butter nan, full makhan may be due to samoled and gorilla glass. Love you Samsung. My favourite brand. Battery is good as expected. Overall a masterpiece from Samsung. Goodbye.

Samsung recently introduced its latest smartphone in the M-series with the launch of Galaxy M31. The smartphone comes with a host of interesting features and it is priced at Rs 14,999 for 6GB RAM + 64GB storage and Rs 15,999 for 6GB RAM + 128GB storage variant.¬†

¬†

The latest smartphone from Samsung is loaded with a powerful 6,000mAh battery along with improved cameras and sleek design. So, is it enough to compete against the likes of Poco X2 and Realme 6? Let‚Äôs find out.¬†
Let‚Äôs start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.¬†

Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.¬†

¬†
Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review

¬†
The Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.¬†

¬†
That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.

¬†In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.¬†

Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review

¬†
The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.¬†

¬†
Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.¬†

¬†Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review

¬†The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.¬†

¬†
On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company‚Äôs custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.

Purchased this Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) from amazon on 8h March 2020. After using 3 months here is my review.

First impression: Value for Money. Great phone for the price range of 15k.

Proc:
1) M31 already use Android 10.0 as factory default operating system. This OS has been installed together with Samsung user interface ONE UI 2.
2) four-camera at back side body with 64 MP f/1.8 for standard + 8 MP f/2.2 for ultrawide + 5 MP f/2.2 for Macro + 5 MP f/2.2 for DOF. The main camera with 64 megapixel and big aperture number will help us take better light at dark situations.
3)  LCD screen resolutions use Super AMOLED for good color display. The screen resolutions also already have Full HD+ at 1080 x 2340 pixels.
4) have big battery 6000 mAh. This is very important for anyone who want to use Android smartphone more then 2 days at standard activity.
5) have big battery 6000 mAh. This is very important for anyone who want to use Android smartphone more then 2 days at standard activity.

Cons

1) Charging time, It will take nearly 3hrs to full charge
2) Front camera does not have LED flight flash for selfie photo. This camera is located at top of LCD screen. But we can use LCD display brightness for light help.
3) Not water resistance.

A great phone for the price. Here are the pros and cons:
PROS:
1. 6000mAh battery that easily lasts for more than a day.
2. 6 GB RAM that makes switching between tasks very smooth and quick.
3. Quad camera setup takes excellent pictures. (The photo of the box was taken on the M31.) The 32 megapixel front camera also takes great selfies.
4. The super Amoled display is on par with all the flagship devices. Amazing viewing experience.
5. Comes with latest Android 10.
6. Although the processor isn't a flagship chipset, it can easily handle games like Asphalt 9, Call of Duty Mobile, PUBG, etc. at high graphics without any visible lag.
7. Manufactured in India. During this time when boycott of Chinese goods is on the rise, this is the best alternative to any other Chinese branded phone on the market at the price range.

Cons:
1. Certain aspects of OneUI 2.0 are missing. Like edge lighting, secure folder, knox security, which are available on models like A51, which runs on the same chipset.

Final review: Although certain aspects available on other samsung models are not on the phone, the pros heavily outweigh the cons, making this one of the best value for money smartphones. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a phone between ‚Çπ15,000 to ‚Çπ20,000.

I'm reviewing this product after using for a week..It is absolutely an beast in this price segment..One thing about Samsung is that..Its super amoled display,security and build  ...

-SOFTWARE:8.5/10
The new OneUI 2.0 built on Android 10 is superb and user friendly..Also it has some good features

-DISPLAY:9/10
The 6.4inch amoled display  with full-HD+ is good...It supports Widevine L1 to which is awesome..The details were richer compared to other mobiles in this price segment

-BATTERY:10/10
The massive 6000mah is pretty good and it lasts upto 1.5 days for a normal user .Charging from 0-75% is good with 15W charger but after it takes a long time to reach 100% ..
Total time taken (0-100%) is 2.5 hrs..

-SOUND:9/10
The sound is decent..it has richer tone and no distortion at high volumes...The Dolby Atmos supports only with Earphones  but it was excellent. Call quality was good..

-CAMERA:7.5/10
As this model is just an upgraded version of m30s,it is just have been improved...The pics came out well in daylight..dynamic range was pretty decent....But video stabilization and photos at low light was not upto the mark..Macro was okayish...The front camera was okay ..But overall good..

-It is not suitable  for high graphics  gaming...
Overheating is not there...I suggest Samsung  to upgrade  the chipset in the future
-Fingerprint reader is very fast
-Phone is slippery..I suggest you to buy a good case for it.

I am writing this review after 10 days.
1.CAMERA
I found the rare camera excellent. The photos speak for there selves but focus is not available in macro mode you have to make exact distance about 3cms to clearly have a nice shot, the night mode is very good. When you open Slow motion videos, you fell lag on the videos. I think it is a software problem because i have seen m30s capturing good slow motion videos by having exactly the same proccer, I hope samsung will solve this problem in future updates.
when we came to the front camera, i think samsung tried to improve the front camera from m30s. It is very great but suffers a little at night time.
2.BATTERY
The 6000mah battery on this device is excellent, it last easly 2 days with moderete users. And can last a full day with heavy users so no need to worry about the battery.
3.DISPLAY
Perfect, no problem with that.
4.VALUE FOR MONEY
the best from devices in this price segment.
5.FINGER PRINT AND FACE UNLOCK
finger print is fast and secure, i have no problem with that. Face unlock is very fast during a day. But doesn't work sometimes at night and artificial light sources.

PROS
1.BIG BATTERY
2.AWESOME DISPLAY
3.GREAT CAMERA
4.FAST FINGER PRINT SCANNER

CONS
1.LACKS FOCUS ON THE MACRO MODE CAMERA
2.THE PHONE HEATS SOMETIMES BUT MANAGABLE.
3.FRONT CAMERA IS NOT SOO GOOD AT NIGHT TIME.
3.FELLS A LAG ON SLOWMOTION VIDEOS

Awesome phone.

I I was concerned about purchasing Samsung products as I used to compare Samsung old phones ans Redmi products earlier.

After reading lots of reviews like this, I purchased this and I'm really satisfied.  I'm sharing a few pros ans cons after using it for 3 days.

Pros-

- Superb battery life
- Amazing Screen- Super AMOLED display is unbeatable
- Managed battery weight cleverly - not at all bulky
- Smooth and fast comparing to Redmi
- Handy
- 64 MP is clearly wortg every penny
- Provides Night view camera, Hyperlapse, Slow mo, Super Slow Mo, panaroma, Macro, wide angle and many more options..

I have attached some pictures for your reference.

Cons-

- Haven't provided wity ultra fast charging - it takes 3-4 hours to full charge
- should provide back cover

Good phone in this budget and better than mi redminote 8 pro.
First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Good:

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good

There are multiple reasons to buy this product-
1. The best specs at this price range.
2. Samsung customer service and support is very good.since they have enormous number of service centres.
3. The phone is very impressive in terms of looks.
4. The battery is 6000mah which means you can stop worrying about the battery to drain fast.

I bought this phone on the launch date 5 march and amazon delivered it within 24 hours.The 64MP camera works really good even in low light,This phone also boasts a 32 MP front camera making video calls super clear.Dolby atoms makes listening to songs and music very good experience.
As far as screen is concerned super Amoled display with pixel density of 443 is best in class.I've been using the phone for about 4 days now and the phone works smoothly.The fingerprint sensor is fast.No heating problems detected so far PUBG works seamlessly in the ultra HD mode.I charged the phone to a 100% and then used the phone for about 45 min,to my surprise the battery was drained just to 1%.
So my verdict on the phone-
Battery life-10/10
Camera-8/10
Display-9/10
Software-9/10
Design-8/10
Performance-8/10
Value for money-10/10

Hi,
I would like to bring this to your notice that I had Purchased Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) Sm-M315FZKGINS worth  Rs.15,999.00 on 5th of March 2020 from Amazon Prime Account which was Sold by STPL Exclusive Online and got was delivered on 7th March 2020.
The Samsung M31 seems to be fake product, its not even a month the phone has stopped working completely. It keeps hanging frequently. While operating any application on phone, it stops responding along with this is issue the speaker quality has become very low (basically it does not functions) No Sound at all. Even while playing random videos on YouTube application as well in the phone's gallery it automatically gets fast forwarded without giving any command.
Its altogether a very disappointing experience not only with the Samsung Phone Brand but also with Amazon Prime Membership Account and the online Retailer (STPL Exclusive Online) listed on Amazon.
I would request to please get the Product replaced Asap, as Due to lock-down I am unable to even take it to Samsung Service Center or to any Mobile Repairing Shop.
Note: Kindly Respond to the above complaint, or legal action will be taken further at your Cost.

M31 is for those who just want a phone which would click decent pictures, have a good battery life, and are not planning for heavy gaming.
Coming to the camera quality, 64 MP camera, it clicks pictures beyond your expectation. The colours seem natural and when you zoom into the pictures you can feel 64 MP.
The only disappointing thing about camera is that Night modes get distorted a lot of times. And even the macro camera didn't perform that good.
Fingerprint sensor is fast but I have faced few issues where it would not respond unless I awake the screen by clicking power button.
Battery life is which stands out in features as it says 6000 mAH. But I am very disappointed about it as after using for almost a week. Even though 6000 mAH, it just feels like I am using a 3500 mAH battery phone. I feel it is the problem with Exynos 9611 processor as it is not optimized. But still you can use the phone for one whole day with playing few games and movies. But with normal usage you can go up to 1 and half day.

But the best feature is that you get sAMOLED display for this price. The colours are awesome. And with widevine L1 certificate you can stream FHD on Netflix and Amazon Prime.

Hello peoples, I have purchased this M31 Last month 18 March, am totally upset due to Samsung M31 because of more gaps in this M31.
 I will tell problem -&gt; 1. Macro camera ( in ad they show small boat photo ve≈ïy clearly from a distance but actually it not like that.
2. Only they additional  camera and increase the mega pixel.Additional macro camera totally waste.
3. Battery - 6000MA ok , when I put charge it take 4 to 5 hrs for full charge.
When i compare to my moto g3 it take 2hrs only for full charge in normal charge.
 Charging time  it take too much of time , it waste.
4. Mobile security, actually I interest in A50S for two main reason one for NFC and other one KNOX Security.
in M30 I don't know actually condition.
But I had review Spec of M31 in GSMARENA ,
NFC is available depend on market,
I saw many review none one not say about NFC they not no about that.

Due to KNOX Security, NFC, Battery charging time, Macro camera it totally  upset my mind on the first day of my purchase it self.

If any development in exist mobile model kindly do some improvement.

Positive point , 6GB ram It working well.

Writing review after using 2 months.

Amoled display is good.
Camera is hyped. Not that great.
Lacking to perform daily regular task.
Hangs a lot. Need to restart each time.
Initially 1 month full battery charge was taking around 2.5 hours . Now it's taking 8-9 hours.

2.0 out of 5 stars

Even though on the bulkier side compared to A and S series, M31 is a great phone given the 6000mah battery. This lasts me the whole day on a single charge.

The charger could have been 18+watts and the cable length is pathetic. Not even 0.8 M. Disappointed in the cable.

Decent camera, easy set up using smart switch.
Also brought a Redmi 8A dual and this phone is only slightly better

Finger print reader lags a bit and is not as fast as the phones other competitors whereas the camera is definitely worth the price (In fact more than value for money). I have compared M31's camera with other brands such as OnePlus and it gives them a competition (But obviously not overpowering them). Bettery life is something that I shouldn't even speak about, the phone lasts for more than 1.5 days for me and when full charged .... üòÇ 6000mah is all I need to say. This pgone overall is totally worth it, no lags as such. Samsung phones generally have poor GPS but there's no such problem with this phone. If you are looking for a phone under 15K then this should be your buy.

Samsung M31 is a very good phone to buy with highest configuration assembled that we can get at this price.
It gives a great feel when using it, with super AMOLED display with 6 GB RAM , ample storage, 64MP Camera and long battery life,it gives you maximum than a other budget phones.

Pros:
1. Long battery life
2. Great Camera (Front and Back) also has wide angle lenses for both front and rear cameras.
3. Smooth Touch Screen Display
4. Perfect Fit in Hand
5. Fingerprint sensor works good
6. OS works really smooth
7. UI is great

Cons:
1. The fast charger provided is only a 2A charger which is less against the battery size, should be on the higher side, takes 2 to 3 hours to get fully charged.
2.  The placement of the fingerprint sensor should have been a bit lower than it is currently placed. Finger reach is difficult.
3. Certain inbuilt apps gets hanged and crashed if they are not updated timely. Also, their update can only happen through galaxy store app. Google Play Store does not respond sometimes.
4. Gets heated up while charging and also when used for a long duration.

Charging time of phone is more than 5-6 hours. But battery drains like a normal 3000 mah one. Nothing monster about it. And amazon support is worst, they are not returning the phone even within 4 days of purchase. Samsung customer care executives are telling me to come to service centre, why did I buy a phone if I had to go to service centre with 4 day of purchase.  Phone hangs even if you use Instagram for 30 min. Bad processor.

I am old user of samsung mobile and i am big fan of samsung display...so for display 5 out of 5 stars...
For camara : i can give 4.5 out of 5 stars...-0.5 because of Samsung captures some high saturated picture.so same for m31 also.
For battery life : 5 out of 5 stars...coz you can go for 1 full day with 6000 mah battery..
For charger : it takes 2 to 2.5 h to get full charge so charger is fast but not so fast.
For performance: 4.5 out of 5 stars as per performance...i am using m31 from last aprox 20 days...i didnt notice any single lag in this phone...-0.5 coz of gaming performance...m31 is good but not that much...

But overall you can surely go for it...this is my genuine opinion on m31...

Budget phone with extra budget facilities...i m satisfied with my purchase...

Thank you
Good product with good price

This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage.
Good:
- Display was good with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good for now. No heating or lagging.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone.
- Mobile speakers sound is fine.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good.

Not So Good:

Feedback

- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.
- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.

Go for it without any doubt.

It offers you a best in class super smiles display and the 64mp quad camera setup is also a true beast. The exynos 9611 is a good processor for day to day usage and is able able to support games such as pubg and fortnite but is not a fully gaming processor at all. This can be the best phone for you if you want a phone for consuming online content on Netflix and amazon prime.If you want the best camera hen also go for it.  Added to this is Samsung brand value and the service is also very good. The only concern with this phone is that it‚Äôs back panel is polycarbonate and there is no design effect on it. The face unlock is also a bit slow but it might be cured through further software updates.  At last I would like to say surely go for itüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª

It's been 2-3 months, I have been using this phone..6+128 GB....after using it rigorously for the period mentioned, I am happy with its performance....I have installed a lot of apps....so battery basically goes on pretty well...I have number of calls in a day and bluetooth is also on 24*7.. sound is pretty good...will definitely njy....the camera is actually good...u get very nice clicks....fingerprint sensor works very well...though I use code protection....selfie cam is awesome....but it is not as sleek as C9 pro if anybody has used....sometimes the wifi signal gets lost while C9 pro is still catching within the same vicinity....picture quality is really awesome....the best part is the price....we can get a no. of phones in this price but personally I prefer samsung....n I think if u compare with other phones...this will stand out in most features...for a regular office going person...this will definitely stand out....plz note this review is without any prejudice n I wont get paid promotions....hehehe....jokes apart....paisa wasool....hope u like the review n buy the best phone of ur choice....good luck...bubye

Hi Guys, Writing Review after using the device for almost 2 weeks. TBH, I was about to buy Redmi Note 8 pro which is in same price range as this one but after thorough comparison i bought Samsung M31.
Pros :
1. Amazing camera. Samsung's M31's photos are more lively and provide you natural element of the clicking environment.
2. Battery Life. It takes upto 2-2.5 Hrs to fully charge the phone and you can use the phone for almost whole day. whole day because at the time of writing this review Lockdown is going on India due to Corornavirus, so i am  always watching Videos and surfing Instagram and Facebook in it.
3. Amoled screen - gives you amazing experience with Videos and movies.

Cons:
1. Not for Gaming - Since i am not gamer, this device perfectly suits my needs. But If you are interested in playing games i would suggest to go with other devices.
2. Charger - Should have given more powerful charger since 6000mah takes alot of time to charge the device with the provided charger.
3. Back of the phone does not feel premium. Feels like a plastic coverup.

Battery:
Battery drains little bit fast
Fast charger and  capable to charge wireless
Apps:

At last it's a big YES for this phone which gives a hassle free experience it's a phone for convenience  latest features at affordable price
Cons:
Blur night mode camera
Battery draining a bit
Little slow in processing which effects gaming we can ignore it for normal functions

I bought this product as soon as the sale started and have been using it since then. The quality of the audio on this phone is great. I found this phone a really great product for someone who wants a good phone in nominal rate. Since then I have recommended this phone to many of my friends and relatives. All the features shown in the ads and written above are correct. The two variants available in ocean blue and space black offer a stylish choice for both girls and boys. Like all other Samsung devices, this phone also comes with a great display. The fingerprint reader works efficiently and the face lock feature is also very fast. I have bought the 128 gb variant so it comes with a lot of memory to store your photos and videos. The best thing about the product that I felt was its camera. If you want a good camera phone at an affordable rate, it is the best. It is literally a mega monster. The battery life is excellent. You can use your phone for 24 hours a day and play games and watch movies without any worries. The charger given along with it charges the phone in a very short time.

This is one of the best mobiles which you can get at under 20k from Samsung. I'm writing after four days of usage.

Pros:
‚Ä¢ Crisp AMOLED display- Dark mode feature is excellent
‚Ä¢ Excellent battery life
‚Ä¢ Decent performance- No heating or lagging and dedicated sim slots supporting  LTE
‚Ä¢ Good photo quality in daylight- Macro performance is very good

Cons:
‚Ä¢ More notifications related to Samsung
‚Ä¢ Poor video stabilisation
‚Ä¢ Samsung is not giving any back cover with it.While mobiles like Redmi Note 8 and many others at same price are giving back covers.

Overall, it is a good deal to buy this phone.

The best budget phone no smartphone can match. Imagine a battery that needs no charging. Lol. At least two days.

What camera? Wow...

Speed...how many cores...just like boss ...wow...

I just hate samsung UI...let android UI be. I shifted from Xiaomi, honor and iPhone.. But never had issues but with this phone I have to unlearn every android or iOS simplicity. Samsung UI is complex. I just have to ask Google everytime for small things like finger print gestures.

All in all I would unlearn everything ahhahahah...thanks samsung!!!!

First of all I will tell you about this product after using 1 week...
1. Coming to the bettery part.. this product has very good battery performance.. battery capacity is 6000mah..

2. I loved display of this product.. display is very very good... see the picture of that display.. i loved it.. this display is sAmoled.. for this price.. this is good.

3. Comming to the Samsung UI.. SAMSUNG has very good UI compared to other brand...it just feel smooth perfomance...

4. There are 64mp main camera.. and 8mp ultrawide camera.. and 5mp macro camera and 5mp depth camera... obviously 64mp provide very sharp images.. but while using this lens.. we can't zoom in... ultra wide camera is good... macro camera also good..

5. As we know Samsung has its own processor Exynos... this exynos processor has little power consuming processor as compared to snapdragon... but this exynos has very good AI about camera...

I couldn't find any drawback of this product at this level.. after using 1 month. i will update my review.. thank you

Camera quality is nice but not that good if considering quad camera
Battery is 6000mah but works as 5000mah
Exynose processor is a drawback as it's slow in comperaing with Snapdragon heating problem is available,will update after using 2,3 months , currently used for 2days
Handset is really nice looks good too
Inbuil fingerprint would have been better
Gorilla glass5 is really a disappointment from Samsung
Many apps locking don't work.
And price is good but they could have improved it way much without spending much
Samsung's audio jack is really a huge disappointment as it provides slow volume as compared to other phones

Best high end device within budget in market. This time Samsung team have outdone themselves. Samsung m31 beats 24000 rs smartphones available in market
Amazing display quality
Awesome pixel density 411 ppi
Smooth performance
Superb look
Battery size is monstrous 6000mah biggest in normal smartphone market. First time i feel like i don't have to charge my smartphone all the time.
Camera quality is also also awesome
I was amazed when i saw this phone and purchased it on the day it launched.
Yes it take little longer to charge it but its obvious because of its battery size.
If you want best smartphone under 25k go for it.
Thank you Samsung for making such a device possible :)

Samsunga galaxy m31 is a decent buy in this category, this phone is suitable for thoose persons which are not too much into gaming altough games work as charm in this one still not recommended fir intense gaming.
Pros
¬∞Awesome battery life, it is what it is claimed Monster.
¬∞Camera quality is decent
¬∞ display is awesome
¬∞ very light weight considering a 6000 mah battery
¬∞android 10 and one ui 2.0 works like charm
Cons
¬∞Cheap plastic made although it will affect you still glass would have been preferred
¬∞ when you second zoom in pics even in daylight the quality is bad
¬∞ slutters in intense games
¬∞fingerprint sensor is small for big fingers although this is the same fingerprint sensor used on all samsung phones in this category still samsung needs to change the diameter of the sensor, response is quick though
CONCLUSION: if you are really tech savvy, gaming type of person then this is not the right phone for you but if you need some brand value and a decent phone which can handle day to day tasks with ease then go for it.

Should be fine for an average user. I dont think this phone can handle heavy gaming. The only game I play on this phone is coin master and I've seen that game not load or just close on its own like 5 times in the 2 weeks I've owned this phone. Camera isn't that good. Display is ok. But its the large battery that is the only reason I bought the phone, and it does last long. Light gaming, YouTube, instagram, twitter, and other daily tasks is no problem for battery life. You can easily see 9+ hours of screen on time, I've seen as high as 11+. I was glad to see there is no idle battery drain. I go to sleep with the battery at 90% and when I wake up in the morning the battery is still at 90% or sometimes 89%. Which is great.

All expectations from Samsung about this phone  came true. I was waiting for this phone since February when I listened on Amazon.
The Battery 6000 MH and 6 GB RAM is enough for playing PubG and other Games without any Problems. 64 Mega pixels camera is good for capturing our memories. Mobiles look is slim and wait only 191gm with 6.4 inch screen. One more thing which I like is dual 4g support sim which was my problem in my Old Model J5 Prime.
I always used Only Samsung phone (after Nokia keypad) in my Life.

Actually I just saw the features of the phone and ordered it.......after that I saw the positive and negative reviews of customers...I was really worried about my phone....but luckily I got best mobile.
  I am reviewing this phone after 5 days of usage.
CAMERA QUALITY-so nice. actually I compared the quality with other pixel mobiles.
FINGER PRINT AND FACE SCANNER-We can easily unlock the phone...I didn't found any default in it.
BATTERY LIFE-It is good and I compared with my previous mobile which is 4000mah.according to mobile description it should work for 21hrs with internet but It worked for 15 hrs...I calculated the screen time of mobile
CHARGING-It takes about 175 minutes to charge from 0 to 100%
And all other features like speaker...etc are all fine.but charging wire is very small.

After using this mobile for two days now im comfortable to write the review.
Pros
1.Strong battery back up(i got 16 hours backup without playing games but i was continuously using internet)
2.camera is way better
3.Screen experience is too good.
4.UI
5.No heating effect while charging the phone
6. Dual 4g
7.No lagging in apps as they have provided  6gb RAM
8.128 GB ROM which is enough
9. Big battery

CONS
Biggest issue is about network.Netowrk is not consistent through out so be aware of this.
1.Fingerprint sensor on back side.It should be on screen or it should be imposed on lock key
2.Material finishing looks cheaper they have used plastic as compared with other brands.
3.Charger should be 30W but m31 is with 15w charger as it takes time to charge
4.In the same price range other brands are giving fastest cpu where as samsung is giving middle class processor to samsung is giving its processor
5.As it is 10nm technology  it reduces battery stand by time while other brands uses 8nm which saves the battery.
6.Charger and mobile design need to be changed.

Absolute winner in this price segment.(6gb 64gb)
Ocean blue color is pretty decent and cool.
No lag. Multi tasking, split screen , call quality, signal reception is excellent. Best is the screen and battery life. For 2 hrs of pubg , 1 hr of ludo/ candy crush , chatting, streaming contents/ social networking for 2 hr , the battery remains at 35-40 percent on wifi and 25-30 % on jio LTE data.
Camera is good in bright light.

Got this phone only for its monster battery backup, but it came out to be a all rounder.

Well,I had a doubt if i could purchase this phone or not!moreover I was between the devil and the deep sea!I wanted to gift this for my dad for his 50th birthday being a teen habit I saved as much I could and thought of spending my money to get my dad this soon the phone arrived and I had an etching desire to open this and somehow gave this as a present to dadü•∞he was word stuck and all wondered if that was brought from my own savings I was still 17 and none could believe I take this special section to thank the #MEGAMONSTER team for making my dad's birthday a remarkable one thanks again!! About the phone it was worth the money and was radiation radiationless reg. The camera it is wow very peculiar and more significant for capture.... on a overall the team had put a tireless effort in making this phone a great success.. cudos to the team.. and wish n hope that God should bless you people with all the good health, success and abundance of happiness in making this model

I have been using this phone for the last 2 months and I am very satisfied with the performance till now.
Pros
1) Good Camera. Crisp picture quality. Wide angle facility with background  blurring facility.
2) Enormous Battery backup. It lasts me 2-3 days.
3) Quite a good amount of memory (128k). Those who do not load huge games, this memory is huge.
4) Quite a big screen. Aspect ratio is such that it is comfortable to hold.
5) Super Amoled display given crisp picture on the screen.
6) Though it has a 6000 mAh battery, the phone is not very heavy.

Cons
1) Though the fingerprint reader is far better than than earlier Samsung phones, it still needs to improve. The location of the fingerprint reader at the back of the phone is a little cumbersome to operate. On-screen fingerprint reader would have been preferred.

If you are looking for a decent good phone within this budget, go ahead and buy it. It is absolutely the best buy at this price.

Things that this phone does not live up to its promise:
1. Front camera quality is not good. Dosent feel like a 32 MP definitely. Don't forget to  turn off the beauty mode.
2. The night mode amplifies  up things artificially
3. The main camera does not live upto the 64 mp hype- 48 MP cameras of other phones may be better. However for the price the macro, background blur effect and daylight photos are good.

The operating system with the android  10 is good, screen quality is super, built is nice, fingerprint  sensor  very responsive,  no lags, decent sound quality, super battery.

Product is ok...

Positive:-
1)Charge is drained 100% to 70% from 7 am to 4 pm (including data and phone calls) ...

2) Call audible quality is good...

3) Device Weight is low when compared to Realme

4)Display quality is good...

5) speaker sound is good..

6) Selfies is good in low light areas....

7) Auto call record is available

Negative:-

1) Rear Camera quality is not much high... It's an average quality... photo pixels are broken

2) Heat of the device is little bit high when data is on

3) There is no more accessories except Charger adapter and charger cable

4) Noice cancellation is an average... Surrounding noise is heared to opposition

5) Charging the device from 0% to 100% is 2:45 mints because of 15W charger

6) Face unlock not working in low light areas

Overall Product is good for battery backup users
And not well in Camera users

For office goers , home makers, I would say this is the best phone with best specification from a well known brand. I am writing this review after 5 days of decent use. Battery can survive for 2 days easily even with decent data usage. No heating issue. 64 MP Camera and video quality is so good like a flagship phone. Without a cover, the phone is too slippery to handle. Wide angle camera quality is okay but I don't use it frequently so it is not a big compromise. Selfie camera with 32 MP is a good trade off. No lag or delay in graphics, the transition is too smooth. Gorilla glass 3.0 is very helpful. Speaker sound and quality is very decent enough. Great Audio quality while using this M31 with bluetooth headset especially with "Dolby Atmos" effect on, which I didn't expect. I was planning to buy M30S, but after knowing the launch of M31, I was waiting for 15 days to book this one. Having a 64 MP camera phone would definitely need a 128 GB storage to store your beautiful memories. Worth buying, go for it.

- 128 GB storage is pretty good.
- supports 512 GB memory card with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone.
- Rear Camera is really good.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good.
Overall I can say is best one at this price.
As of now no negative side / disadvantages.
Will update again I find any.

Pros of M31
*Wonderful performance while comparing with all other m series
*Awesome battery stand by
*Beautiful finish
*Switching over apps was much quicker
*I love those application usage timers in it this could reduce our addiction over any applications
*Onto the cameras this stands at top level among other brands as well those 64MP primary made some extraordinary pictures
*Added advantage of fast charging and those wide angle focus in cameras are pretty lovly

In general this was an wonderful product and customer satisfying one!!!!

Cons
*Mobile weight was little bit heavier if you are preferring to a back case
*Cameras were designed to be bulged from the back surface that could lead to sketches if there is any rough handling

I have seen too much of advantages and exiting features and some disadvantage like weight,etc

Sometimes i pefer weightless gadgets

Over all this mobile will get a rating of 4.6/5

Overall phone experience is awesome.
1. Screen- Amoled screen in very good and smooth, colours are very good.
2. Body- Phone body is very good and slim.
3. Camera- 64mp camera is provide in this phone but reality is different its looks like 32 mp camera and front camera is 32mp but reality looks like 16mp. Overall performance of camera is good not excellent.
4. Battery- It has 6000 mah battery. Battery performance is very good but feature of fast charging is a joke. Battery takes 3 to 4 hours fully charged.
5. Fingerprint reader is awsome.

This is a monster mobile. Monster in good sense. Very good battery life well full battery charge take some time well its obvious its 6000 mah battery. Camera quality is best. Not tested 64 mp till now coz its 3 days review, front camera is really awesome. Single speakers and its loud enough. Did not received  earphones in the box, apart from that its the best mobile under this budget. 4.5 star go for it. More over It's Samsung.

Not happy with camara back and Front, even front camera is perform like VGA camera.

Also full plastic body seems Samsung made this PRODUCT by mistake and we buy to consider Samsung brand !

Compare to this other all phone are best in quality and money saver too with aluminum body!

Feeling like we fool that use this phone and can't return coz loackdown immediately after buy "covid 19"

This phone is a big black spot on Samsung brand image, I strongly recommend not to buy this.

Night mode also not working face unlock is also frustrating and not working most of time.

1-The Galaxy M family has now transformed into a much bigger lineup and garnered a lot of attention,

2-It offers very good battery life dats long for a 2 &amp; half day backup..

3-Scrolling through One UI 2.0 was smooth and apps were quick to open as well. Throughout our week-long usage, we did not encounter any slowdown or lags while using different day-to-day apps for messaging, social media browsing and so on.¬†

4-it does manage to click shots that are generally pleasing to the eye and come out with rich colour and enough detail, its just possible because of wide angle and monster 64 cam..

5-In the real world, this ultra-wide lens adds an all-new way to look at frames and click pictures fitting in more space than you would be able to use a standard smartphone camera.
6- fingerprint sensor captures impulse on d go ..
 Backcover is very shiny carbonate piece making it light weight .....
Excellent monster features on d goooo!!!!!

Before m31 I have m30s  which is one of the best smartphone coming up at that range. Now as the upgradation move on m31. The camera quality with quad 64 MP rear camera comes with different modes is amazing and spiced up with Bixby vision you can click pictures that hard to differentiate from HD wallpapers. With the 6000 mAh battery can endures your smartphone processes for as long as 1 day of continuous activity (non gaming) Fingerprint is perfectly sensitive and better than compare to m30s. 6 GB RAM can provide perfect speed throughout the running apps. Best part about it sAmoled screen is one of the best features that make it different from other phones the colour quality because of that is completely amazing and on top of that while comparing it to iPhone 8 screen for sure samsung going to win over.

One of the best phone to buy in a range of 15k -25k.
I am feeling so happy while using it.
Pros:- 1 - The processsor is super fast and we can easily multitask without any lag.

2- The reason why i choose this phone over Redmi was the AMOLED display offered by samsung which is awesome. Now i can watch movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime with better picture Quality as it feels like i am watching in a theatre.

3- Sound Quality is super as it provides with DOLBY ATMOS in this range .

4- The amazing part is that it has a battery of 6000mah which is impossible to get from any great brand like Samsung. I charge it after 3 days if using on a normal basis.

5- The camera of this phone makes your picture is being clicked by a DSLR. I have now started using this for clicking my pictures and stopped using my DSLR

This phone is a go ahead and experience the great features with it.
I strongly recommend to go for Samsung M31

The Galaxy M31 is comfortable to hold in the hand but is a little heavy at 191g. The weight of the smartphone is mainly because of the big 6,000mAh battery that it packs. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy M31 with an Exynos 9611 SoC and gets 6GB of RAM. It has two storage variants to choose from, 64GB and 128GB.The 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy M31 is excellent for this segment of the smartphone market. It has wide viewing angles, vivid colors, deep blacks, and pretty good brightness levels that only fall short in the harshest of sunlight. I think so this is the best phone realeased by the samsung upto the date under 20000rupees which serves with monster camera means quad camera of 64mp and 38mp front and back respectively.last bur not the least it has monster battery and the fast fingerprint reader and facereader.you can even create your emojis in it. Worth for money.i would really like to thank samsung to create such revolutionarie phone under 20000rupees

Mobile features justifies with its name that is mega monster.
Pros.
1. Battery life- as I'm using mobile from last 7 days it's battery life is beyond my expectations. I'm heavy user and battery running life is arround 48 hours.
2. Camera- four different cameras works in very good manner. Picture quality is excellent. When i zoom the picture it don't make blurred pixels.
Front camera is also doing it's duty strongly.
Mobile with latest features are excellent
Few of them are pop up screen, side button uses, good adoption of fingerprint sensor.
And the best thing is its super amoled display makes this mobile very attractive.
Cons.
If i talk about mobile cons there is only one what i get is- facelock feature is not working as good as i expected.
Rest choice is yours, but after using this mobile i have recommended my friends to buy this mobile, and give you suggestion the same.
In it's price segment it's really mega monster.

I have been using this phone for the past 2 days now and here‚Äôs what I have to say:

1. It‚Äôs battery backup is amazing. Even if you continuously watch netflix and other stuff, then also you‚Äôll be able to manage a battery backup of 1.5 days.

2. It‚Äôs a very eye friendly screen and doesn‚Äôt give any stress to the eyes even if you continuously watch videos.

3. Dark mode is just awesome with a very dark experience.

Here‚Äôs what I didn‚Äôt like:

1. They could have given a 18w fast charger with the device as it takes approximately 160 minutes to charge from 0-100%.

2. Speaker misses out the true sound detail.

3. A plastic back attracts a lot of scratches even if you treat it like a baby.

Otherwise, it‚Äôs a very good phone in this price point but if you‚Äôre a rough user then you might want to keep a cover ready as soon as you order the device.

Hope this review will be helpful üëçüèª

We were cheated on this product. This mobile did not work properly even for a day. It lasted just three hours. After this there was a hang problem. It was restarting automatically. After this the speaker and microphone automatically stopped working in this mobile. I'm so sad to buy it. I bought something from Amazon for the first time. I did not know that I would regret buying from Amazon. Right now i'm so sad about it.

This is not for professional users. This does not have any security feature. You cannot lock any app and it does not have any secured folder. It's required to store any password or important data. Some times our mobile will be used by friends or kids, during that time this phone is not useful ,No privacy or security. Installing third party apps for this purpose may be risky.

I used J7 series earlier, in that feature was there whereas in m31 it's not there. I have seen many reviews and no one mentioned about this.

Finger print reader you have search. Back cover and sensor almost  same texture.

Charging is normal only not fast. Audio output in below speaker is not enough.

When flash is used video is coming black  in slow motion camera.

It's easily getting heated up. After video recording u cannot make call comfortably. Near ear piece it's hot.

Overall I feel disappointed with the security feature.

The phone is absolutely amazing!!! I have bought it myself on the very first day of the sale, and by my usage of about 9 to 10 days, the phone is absolutely killer. Although it's not aimed for gamers in mind, the m31 still pulls off games with great ease and no lag. Moreover, the phone feels lightweight as a feather despite packing in a 6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging, which charges this battery in about 2 hours. The display is the best part of the phone. Extremely gorgeous display with a small notch. Moreover, the quad camera array at the back houses an 64 MP camera, which gives extremely detailed photos. The 8MP ultrawide and the Macro camera also are the best in this price bracket. I am exceptionally happy to upgrade from my old phone to this one, and I would recommend it to someone who is a causal gamer and wants a phone with a big battery, great display and awesome cameras. The hashtag used by Samsung #MegaMonster is truly apt for this phone.

Amazing phone, smooth, feels more like i phone 11. Its battery takes a lot of tike to charge...but once charged alcan be used forever
Okay so, the phone is better than any other phone launched recently
I guess its been some weeks since i have been using this but this monster feels just like  a brand new one.
My suggestion is never put a screen guard or a tempered glass on the phone coz it lags the phone and touch response becomes really bad BUT..there s a setting for the screen guard users to increase sensitivity and it goes smooth again
The phone s brilliant and i love the performance and its very light in weight. The battery backup is cool and long lasting.
I literally watched a 3 hour movie with just 16percent charge in phone..
I suggest all the customers to buy a m31

I am reviewing this after 1 week use of Samsung Galaxy M31.
Design : Premium look and feel.
Camera : M31 has best camera in its segment. Picture clicked on it has very minute details even if you click the image very closely. I have taken the few and you can check. I'll rate 5/5.
Battery : Battery is also exceptionally well that lasts upto 2 days with moderate usage. 5/5
Processor : Till now it is running very smooth. seeing no lag so again will give 5/5.
UI: Samsung provides customer friendly User Interface. Face unlock works little bit slow but fingerprint sensor is very fast. 4.5/5

Earlier I was using redmi note 6 pro but I found so many issues specially GUI and device hang, I decided to switch to samsung and till now I am pretty much satisfied with it.

Yesterday I got stucked when I was using keyboard..I have to restart the mobile...anyhow after this I didn't get any problem.

Front camera is not much butter as compare to other mobile 32 mega pixel comera.
The image getting blured when zooming  the image.

Rear camera is good.
All sensors are working as expected.

Some features must be implement which I didn't find in this mobile like -

1. Internet speed status bar on the top of the screen.

2. Daily data usage should be visible inside the top scroll bar It will help the user to limit the daily data use otherwise he went to know only when he spend 50% or 90% through sim card notification.

Battery life is good and we are able user it more longer time as compare to other mobiles.

I love the screen quality of this mobile.
I got some new features in this mobile which are really  very helpful. Thanks Samsung!!!!!!

6k battery is its usp.
Not at all bulky considering it has a 6k battery
It comes with latest android version 10 n Samsungs 1UI 2.0.
Smooth performance. 128 gm memory is enough for an above average user same with 6gb ram.
Nice camera with great options. Same with selfie camera. Pics in low light/night could be better but guess its a software thing that samsung would fix in the future updates.

Bought it a week back , best part of it is , its battery life which make me sure that i dont have find changing stations everywhere. Camera quality is more then average but definently not the best apart from it i love the price tag in which its available.
So kudos to M series .
Yet to explore its functions till date doing good.

Value for money i will say.

I did a lot of research before i bought this phone. 1.First of all, the battery life is absolutely amazing, a heavy user like me is not able to kill battery in a day.
2. The camera quality is quite decent. Although expected more , but for this price range it is pretty gud.
3.The display is top notch , its quite gud and colorful.
4. The fingerprint scanner has absolutely no time lag. It is very well made.
5. The performance is quite gud. Although, samsung Exynos was used. There was many critics who wished for Snapdragon,  but for daily use it runs well.

The only problem i hv come across is heating. Its not over heating, just little increase in temperature.  This happens only while playing high spec games like PUGB. It is not problem , just mentioned it just in case.

Overall, for people who are looking for a decent gaming and daily use phone. This Samsung Galaxy M31 is my recommendation to you.

the Samsung Galaxy M31 arrived in blue. The battery lasts a whole day if you hit it hard with games. It can be said that I was there all day, from when I woke up to when I fell asleep playing on the mobile and using it and it lasted with a 10% battery surplus. The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything. The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaints with anything about this mobile and 128GB of internal storage, I do not even consider using the microSD slot since 128GB for me is enough, combining it with Google Photos is much more than enough for me.

Highly satisfied with the looks of this phone..... camera is great but still trying to figure out what to do with macro mode.... performance is a bit compromising but still can't say it's bad in this price..... previously I was using Samsung M30 which had 5000mah battery but in that Battery lasted more than in this device.... would highly recommend to try this phone.....It can actually be called upgraded version of M30.....üòö I like it because of its display, camera and looks.... performance could have been more efficient but still it's good enough for daily use and gaming also. It has letest version of Android so hopefully it'll get newer versions of Android sooner in comparison of other devices running on older versions of Android.....In M30 also got upgraded versions quickly

Awesome phone.

4- over all value for money phone.

Samsung has been doing quite well with m-series smartphones. The newly launched Samsung Galaxy M31 is a really good phone. If you have a budget of ~15000/- then you can definitely go for this phone. Performance, battery life and camera quality is better than Xiaomi smartphones.

Got the delivery on time.. Thank to Amazon services...

Undoubtedly M31 is a Mega monster.
I checked its battery life by just using it with daily usage like watching movies/series, playing games, listening to music, calling and guess what it turned out to be THE BEST smart phone.

samoled screen is literally pleasing to watch.

I watched the whole season of Special OPS in 1 night on this monster phone which was having around 30% battery.

This should give you a hint about its powerful battery.

Dolby Atmos music is cherry on cake.

Moreover games run brilliantly.

I would love to mention about the battery again.... I charged it next day to 100% to check how long it works...

With 100% battery... I could use it for 2 complete days.

That is just INSANE.

Thanks Samsung for this amazing M31 SUPER SMART MONSTER PHONE.

Has been a Redmi user for long but switching to Samsung is one of the best decisions i ever made.

Pros- Extraordinary Camera-I wanted to take a handicam as I am a Teacher and wanted to record videos for students but i suppose i don't need to spend on anything else.
2. Zero heating- Redmi's heating issues bought me here and i suppose i made a great choice.
3. Processor- I have downloaded high intensity games like asphalt, Pubg to kill Lockdown boredom and i see absolutely no lagging and heating.
Ps- I multi-task like hell yet its greatüòä
4. Battery life is love. A proper Full charge lasts above one and half dayüòäüëç

Cons- Initially felt It charged a bit slowly but then realised its done to save its battery from damage and i feel fine.

The phone is awesome now almost I used this phone since 10 days its battery life is 6000mah a lotüëçcamera quality is very good the details are awesome on the macro cam or on normal and 64mp cam.Night camera is also good . Samsung give this  variant at very low price like 6,64 in 15999 and 6,128 in 16999. No one gives that 6,128 in RS1Ik more which is pretty cool. While other gives top variant in more rate. Display is super good. One main option its sound quality is good like in xaomi phone that I used it's on call hearing quality is super worst. In this phone the fingerprint and face unlock is little slow but it is ok. Its is light weight phone and its screen size makes it fully grip in hand. Its plastic back body makes it's less chance of fall from hand. Although the phone  is good . Gaming experience is too good as you can play pubg on top graphics almost 7hrs+ with no lag .
The phone is full value for money.

So i have been using this phone extensively  for 4 days I decided to buy this phone as I consume a lot of YouTube content so screen and battery life was important to me so I chose this phone moreover something strange with this phone is that it gives me up to 1mbps speed on my jiofi(I live basically in middle of a forest..so that's great for me ) and cellular quality is top notch and the UI is just awesome also camera is top notch and all sensors are superb

To talk about cons sinc it uses exynos 9611 chipset u cannot expect a great gaming experience u can still game at high graphic setting but with mild frame drops I have tried pubg, asphalt 9 etc on this on medium settings this phone works like charm

So overall this phone is a great buy if u are stepping from other brands(previously was using a note 7 pro) but not a good upgrade as compared to M30s(almost similar)

So happy shopping

The delivery of the product was very fast, I recieved the product within 48hrs.

Fingerprint reader: Very good 5/5
Camera: camera is AMAZING!!! 5/5
Battery: 6000mah battery is AMAZING 5/5
Charging: 15W fast charging is also AMAZING
Display: the display is amazing with sAMOLED FHD+ Infinity U Display, this is the best part that I like in this mobile. 80% of the manufacturing cost goes on the display of the mobile. SAMSUNG display is world famous.

SAMSUNG GALAXY M31 is an all-rounder

Well the Samsung Galaxy M31 is awesome phone. The 64 MP camera captures stunning  photos during day however you cannot zoom in 64 MP during capture. The camera quality is really awesome. Super Amoled screen is good and the quality is really amazing , it's  screen doesn't feel like you are looking at a screen. It feels like it's  a picture and your eyes never tired of it like it used to be in LCD screen. The fast charger provided is fast enough and charges at 1% per min. The huge 6000Mah battery is really Monster and last for 2 days for a normal user. I'm  really happy to buy such an amazing phone.

However I would like Samsung to include selfie capture just by using fingerprint  sensor , this is the only thing it is lagging and everything in One UI is amazing.

Will be super great if there is an notification for daily data usage which synchronizes with data plan chosen by customer on any network provider (not on wifi network) and recycles on daily bases. So that We do not need to worry if the daily data limit is over or getting close to daily quota limit, also we can be tension free especially while having work from home (lock down period) or other heavy data utilizing time.

Sorry to say this but right now mobile looks like riding a car or bike without knowing the petrol limit.

Hope to have this feature in future updates.

Mobile quality is very bad, heating issue, network issues, changing problem and camera quality is so bad, phone is looking like too old.

I have called many time to Amazon from first day and they didn't solve my issue.
Layout/user interface is very bad

Its a good product,  if you are Samsung fan or looking to buy Samsung mobile, M31 is recommended in this price range. Good Camera, 6000mh battery is enough to sustain for 1.5 days. Great display, dynamic colors, looks premium with a high quality case.

Audio Sound can be better.

The ultimate phone to have in the M series of Samsung.
As I have already been a user of M30s, I can very accurately describe I went for M31.
Besides the usual camera upgradation from 48MP to 64 MP (rear) and 16MP to 32MP (front) , I find M31 simply more responsive and compatible under my fingers. Besides a 6GB internal system storage and Android 10 OS gives you the feeling of a powerful machine in your hand.
Plus you get the whole package of 6000mAh Battery, 6.4 super amoled display and cool design that gives you the feeling of a premium smart-phone.
Well in nutshell, I can say this phone is a serious winner under the category of budget phone with all premium specifics and a sure thing to hang on to once you buy it.
Happy to buy it from Amazon, super-fast, hassle free delivery.
Word of Advice- Also buy a protective display glass and back cover to give your phone an ever-lasting long life.

The Best Ever Battery and Camera for limited budget..üí•üí• Hope Samsung produces more new smartphones on this process with battery n camera .. The 1st Best Thing in Samsung M31 is  CHARGE almost lasts for 2 DAYS. The 2nd Best Thing is the yr MP Camera is very much better to capture the pictures with Live Focus, Pro Mode, Night Mode , Food Mode, Slow Mo, Super Slow Mo and Hyperlapse. As it is mentioned M31 is a Fast Charging mobile, it takes almost 3 hrs to charge 100%. It should have alleast charged 100% within half an hr to 45 mins. Charging Time is the only backlog for M31. Please Charge it during N8 hrs. If it is charged Once, It will Surely last for 1 and Half days for Sure for regular Mobile Users. It's best to buy this Mobile especially for Low Budget Users.

Got the handset M31_128GB on Thursday (21/05/20). Yesterday  complete data transferred and apps are installed.  Today afternoon 1.30 pm onwards handset started heating abnormally. I don't know the exact reason For heating and I am really worried what needs to be done, replace the same or refund. As it's just one day old, am not able to decide for further steps. Pls suggest

The camera is not THAT good.. I mean the way they show it in the ads. But then again, at this price,  it's acceptable. The phone should have come with a cover cuz the metallic finish makes it slippery. The hardcover I ordered with it was of no use. I had exchanged my previous phone and got almost Rs. 5000 off  and I immediately regretted it as a lot of tools/in built functions do not exist in this phone. The only good thing which still is debatable is the battery I guess. I wish I had bought some other phone instead.

The camera quality is absolutely amazing to click landscape pictures and portraits. The provided 4 cameras live focus makes the object clearer and the background blury which enhances the beauty of pics. The front camera gives u to ways to enhance Ur beauty like smoothening the face and making Ur eyes look bigger. The battery life is amazing as one time charging can last up to two days with Ur data or WiFi on the whole day. The fingerprint readability is very quick. Within a flash of seconds it reads Ur fingerprint even with Ur wet hands. Moreover the phone runs very smoothly even with lots of apps, documents and pictures. The screen is till the edge of the phone which gives a super hd quality to watch any videos with numerous editing options. Overall feature of the phone is superb and gives Excellent results. It's voice and mic are fabulous üòç which records sounds with super quality

Using it for the last 4-5 days and here is what I feel about it

Likes:
The display is really good and considering other three important aspects, camera is really nice, as of battery for a regular use after charging it went on for nearly 2 days and Fingerprint reader response is fast. Doesn't heat up during regular use, haven't used for playing games so can't say much about that.

Dislikes:
The sound from the speaker is low, mobile feels a little heavy, so can't hold it for long. Missing the led notification light, I loved that feature from my last mobile phone(but it is also good, less distraction). Hearing a hissing sound during phone calls, still have to check whether it is a problem with the speaker or the network problem.

I would suggest buying this to other customers as till now, it's been 3 months I have this phone, and I'm using this phone for gaming purpose each and everyday for at least 3hours per day, but still battery survives for around 48 hours. So no doubt battery is really good. But day by day it's getting weaker I think. While playing PUBG Mobile default settings, battery drains faster than other games and app.
I have no complaints on display.
Camera is not as good as expected from a 64MP primary camera, but that Slow Motion and other camera features are good and enjoyable.
Processor is OKAY for me, as I do use HD graphics and Ultra framerate by default in PUBG Mobile, and it runs smooth. I'm not going to higher those graphics as I'm no professional gamer and and graphics looks smooth for me.
 For simple use and for free time gamers like me, think this phone is perfect.

The product is wisely good to use daily tasks run smoothly.. app transitions were smooth . No stuttering or legs.  Display takes it all..crisp and clear with viewing angles...too good. Was so amazed by the camera picture quality . Decent pics lowlight pics were good too. Only con is the phone gets lil hot just below the selfie cam..if used for more than 10 min or on call . One ui is decent way better than touchwiz. Bloatware can be removed or disabled. Over all good phone from Samsung gives tight competition to other phones in the same price bracket. Monster battery the name says it all..more than one day or close to 2 days it can last.. gaming is smooth with lil frame drops..

Phone is great in budget, Display is truly amazing .if you are into movies and series on your phone its give good experience .

Voice on speaker is low ,otherwise clarity is good.

Down side is exynos dont get feeling as that we get in snapdragon.
Not a gamer ,but I have tried hand on some and performance is average

Battery size claim  and performance is slight mismatch and with time and at time it feel like 4500 mph.

Any ways overall good phone

Build is good, feel is good

Get good backcover immediately or you can have fingerprints all on back of phone.

I bought this phone for 3 reasons:
- Awesome Screen
- 2 Days Battery Life Yet Easy To Carry
- Great Camera Performance

I am happy to say that Samsung M31 delivers on all the above promises.

What could have been better:
- Newer chipset although I haven't seen any lag in any normal tasks thanks to the great optimization done by Samsung folks.
- Battery charging time is a little high as the battery capacity is very hugh despite the 15W fast charging capacity.

I think it would be too much to ask for anything else from a device this good at such an amazing price point.

In short, if you want a device with an awesome screen, huge battery life and amazing camera - just go for the MegaMonster Samsung M31.

I got the delivery of phone on 6 March.
When you first boot up the phone you will get update for February security patch.
This phone comes with One Ui 2.0 &amp; the first best part of is you can delete preloaded apps. This ui is more snappy &amp; feels like a premium phone even though it's a midrange phone.
Pros :-
1) Super amoled display with L1 certification
2) UI is more responsive &amp; can be customizable as per our need which basically give a feel of stock android.
3) Battery Backup is killer you can do the excessive task on this phone.
4)Ram Management is on point.
Cons :-
1) Photos of night atmosphere
 are not good.
2) Speaker of the phone is ok.
3) Placement of headphone Jack.
4) Slow Charging speed &amp; length of the USB cable is too short.
Though, Samsung gives good package of software's like Dolby atmos, MrOwl for unlimited cloud storage.

Never buy phones from Amazon. They have sent me defective phone. It is switches off several times,  this phone is not even receiving network properly. Internet speef is like 2g and people on the other end always complain about my voice getting cut and low voice during the call. I was assuming that due to lockdown Network is weak. But its been two months I have been facing same problem and have realized the phone is defective. Amazon is not ready to replace the phone. This is my first and last phone from Amazon.

Software isn't  as sturdy as needed, seems slower at most of the times.
Camera is good, but not as good as claimed. Even 6/10 as claimed.
Battery charges fast enough and gives good back up.
Fingerprint sensor is ok only, while as face recognition isn't even ok.
Overnight downloading stops by itself and you need to manually turn on/off the data to keep up the downloading. Checked all the settings but the issue persists.

I guess, Phone's software needs some sort of upgrade and the phone will be perfect among all other phones of under 20k range.

Network connection is very unstable for Wifi networks, and the phone is very slow to respond at times.
Wifi keeps dropping off for 5GHz networks especially.
Phone shuts down automatically and remains in that state for almost 15 minutes.

I think it is the best phone under 15000/- .
Fingerprint sensor is fast and there is no issue about it. Camera quality is superb but i think if the camera's aperture were 1.7 then it will destroy every other company's smartphone in camera segment though it has very nice capacity to take very good pictures. The pics taken by it still so awesome. Atlast the battery life is very good. If someone wants to increase the battery life then they can use some tricks like blocking wifi scanning, blocking nearby device scanning , blocking bluetooth scanning,  using, dark mode, blocking unwanted notifications from the apps, using power saver mode, ultra data saver mode, and data saver mode. Then battery performance will be raise to the extreme.

I've used this product for nearly 10 days and now I'll share its Pros and Cons.

Pros
1) It has a great battery life.
2) The display is bright and rich in details.
3) Camera is very good (But i would say one of the best in this price segment).
4) Sound output is good.
5) Overall design is good sleek and light weight.
6) Samsung UI's user experince is easy and stutter free.

Cons
1) The phone seems to be a little slippery.
2) Gets warm while playing heavy graphics games Pubg or pes ( was a bit disappointed). But it's Kay when you keep the settings under balanced or medium graphics. Not recommended for heavy gamers.
3) Plastic body doesn't give a classy look.
4) Charging speed is very slow (But you have to accept it for the bigger battery size). Takes approx 2.5 hours for 0-100%.

Hey Everyone! Its almost upto 5 days i have been using this Flagship smartphone SAMSUNG GALAXY M31(6GB/64GB). My experience is amzing with this phone. Everything is working properly(FingerPrint sensor and other biometric locks) Camera is very clear and is making photos very stable. The most most most amazing feature in this phone is its battery lifeüë£ Even if after operating this phone for hours, playing games and using many other battery conusming apps it only falls by 10% or 15%. Best for gaming, it never overheats and no lag &amp; bug observed!
In comparison with other Smart Phones it is best budgetary phone till now on Amazonüòá
Grab this deal ASAP and have a good day!‚ù§
Thankyou for your Precious Timeüòä
Stay Safe üíØ

So I'm using this device from more than 2 months..and I can say it's definitely not that a phone which I can call a brilliant one ..battery life is good camera is good..
Fingerprint is okay but will not work if your finger is a bit wet..but overall it's good for me..
No issues of hang-up...and yes with no doubt its samsung and you can go for it..

It has a decent camera with numerous features...........night mode is not very good it is just ok. But other features of camera do not let you feel the shortcoming of night mode.
Performance vise, it is good with fast speed and doesn't lag due to it's big ram. This phone doesn't provide bixby as A series do
Setting and notification panel provide many features  for great experience.
Biometrics is good...........1 out of 8 times fingerprint sensor doesn't recognize you but works good even with wet hands.......face lock is also decent.
The features that stand out from all of these are........its screen with amoled display is simply treat to our eyes, battery charger could be more fast but still it is good, performance and classiness.................if your budget is around 15 to 16k then you can definitely look upto this mobile

Great value for money phone as a primary as well as secondary phone. Great battery life as charge once and forget it for next 2-3 days depending on use. Camera is also very good in day light but stuggle in night but overall good from price point of view. Display is crisp with good visibility in direct sunlight and the best value phone under 18k . Far better then Chinese phone

Nice move from Samsung
After SAMSUNG M30s
 M31 looks like an update Of m30s
With the price 16000
6GB128 GB

Photos are looks good taken on m31
With 64mp quad camera
32mp selfie camera takes good pictures
6000mah battery gives more comfort  to keep using more than a day-
Wifi calling option  good
Display good
Color also gives  a good look
I giving 5* because  no other mobiles  can't beat M31 within this budget
I'm a Xiaomi Redmi fan for the last 6 years
Mi3,redmi note2, 3s,3sprime,redmi note 5pro, redmi 8a,at last Mi A3
I changed my mind from mi to Samsung because  of the features in this low budget
I buy m30s, and m31
Are best to buy

Feel heating  while continuously usage .
Otherwise  all best in this budget
Thanks for Samsung

Writing this review after 10 days of usage.
Pros:
Amoled display is the highlight of the phone.
Camera has improved when compared to M30
Fingerprint sensor works smoothly
Call quality is commendable
Dedicated memory card is handy feature

Cons:
Phone frequently getting stuck in Samsung logo boot screen ,software not stable!!!
Not a phone for gamers
Over heating while charging
Delicate Plastic body,so cover is a must
6000 mah battery will last 1 day only, don't expect more. Software optimization is not as good as miui for killing or hibernating background apps.Do to this ,battery drain is more.

This phone has Very good display. Sound quality is decent. Camera and Battery are excellent and in day to day life phone is very easy to use and doesn't feel heavy. Thanks to the Samsung UI all my with Android Q it's clean and simple. Speaker is not so loud. Fingure print reader is fast. I also played many games like asphalt 9 and did face any lagging issue because of 6 GB ram. Multitasking is very well handled. The body is little delicate so you need a protective case. Overall it's a good phone and also made in India.

This mobile is worth for pricing range. But while using internet the back to portion of mobile is getting heat.
The courier package also so worst. Seller has simply mobile box into the courier cover and they dispatch There is no safety covers or rappers covers this box and the courier delivery person also handling this stuff's very rudely.He simply put the bag into the ground and searching my parcel.

Very good super amoled display, customized camera to AI beauty mode myself, very smooth processor more than enough for multitasking,we can easily uninstall bloatware, amazing Dolby Atmos music background,fast face unlock even in dark night,finger sensor added advantage and fast as well,nice wide angle selfie, super slow motion video recordings,4k videos recording, default assistive touch inside settings to avoid physical buttons, attractive infinity U display,6000mah battery huge boost for display and avoid frequent charging which last for full one day on Heavy usage, moderately for 1.5 day, customizable user interface,clear call quality without any frequent  drops,snappy 6gigz/128gigz....worth for 16k.... real megamonster

I got M31 on 6th March and with  in a month time there was a software update on April 10th. I accepted the software too  my goodness the mobile got hanged and its in downloading status from morning 11 am on wards........... Its like dum next to me .
Reason is there is a software issues in the mobile and also the mobile is getting hanged often.
Its not worth to buy in Samsung  no value for money and it a stress for us.

I am using Samsung mobile since last 3 years. First one was J7 pro second A70 now Now M31 but all processor works in same way. You can't imagine some time it's take 10 second to connect the call after receiving so conclusion is that it doesn't matter you spend 15k or 60k in Samsung mobile the problem of hang will remain same. Very Poor performance just wastage of money.

Initial product review - 1. the battery easily lasts for a day with mobile data on for the most part.
2. The 64 MP main camera produces amazing pictures with good balance
3. The new processor works buttery smooth with multiple apps running simultaneously.
 4. Also a type C otg adapter would have been appreciated
5. I would have loved to see Samsung release a matte black version of the phone, but the glossy "space black" still looks pretty good

*Best in its price range*

Fingerprint sensor:Very quick almost all the time.

Face unlock: just best (even with specs).

Battery life: NEVER ENDING,it may take a little time to charge but it remains like till infinity.
(I watched a whole movie in 720p using less than 10%).

Camera:64mp camera is so so great.may be redmi note 8 pro have a little edge over it.
(You can see photos in this review.)
Ultra wide is wider than my range of vision.

Performance:gr8 gr8 gr8 no problem at all
Simple Samsung ui

In hand feel:a little heavy but it gives a premium feel.

Screen:best I've ever seen (amoled is so great}

Overall if you are confused which one to buy go for it.I m using it for a good time and I m fully satisfied.

I bought this phone on Day 1 of Sales. Excited, but Excitement didn't last long.

2nd Day started seeing issues like it hangs a lot, becomes non-responsive for almost 10 min and has to force restart every time. So requested for replacement. Got replacement after a couple of days, hoping this would not be defective.

This also started hanging on the first day itself. I think its a software issue.

It suddenly becomes non-responsive, you can hear calls coming in, but can't receive them, the screen becomes off, it won't turn on for the next 10 min or more. I have missed many calls like this.

On the paper, the specs and price are absolutely amazing. Now I realize why the phone is sold at lower prices.

Please let me know if any of you also faced the same issues.

I am giving 4/5 stars, one star less for not having folder lock feature.

I like this phone, it's working smooth like butter, it's camera, battery, processor are great and it is handling multitasking pretty well, it has great battery backup too. I am not a pro gamer so for me it's more than sufficient for daily working.
The only cons with this phone is that it is not having folder lock or app lock feature. To get his feature, we have to install third party app. Providing folder lock in this phone would have added more security features for users.

I was not so happy with the last samsung phone i used in 2013 and all these years i was using other brands and finally i decided to buy Samsung galaxy M31 6GB, 128 GB version..i had compared with other phones in this segment including realme, redmi, vivo and oppo.after a lots of home work i went for this one and in simple words it is amazing.in terms of performance, display and battery , its simply the best i would say. Finger print reader works very nice..its fast too.and even face recognition  works fast. The siper display is to he mentioned.and no heating problmes so far.and camera 64 MP back cam offers very good photo experience and 32MP selfie cam is also mind blowing. Battery life is to be mentioned in double inverted comas.its really awesome. It stays for almost one and half days. Multi tasking works very nice.In short as the name suggests, its a monster..i love the new Samsung galaxy M31 experience

Awesome phone. üëåüèªüëçüèª

Display: Super amoled display is best in this range.

Camera: Excellent front and rear camera. Nice picture quality.

Battery: It's huge. For average users gives backup for 48 hours easily.

Fingerprint sensor: It's really superfast. Always works very well.

Processor: Very fast processor. Ultrasmooth experience in day to day work.

User interface: Very simple, still very attractive. Gives nice experience.

Low SAR value.

Build quality: Solid build quality with decent look. Polycarbonate back is less prone to crack and also very light compared to glass back which makes good weight distribution possible despite it's huge battery.

Last but not the least: It's SAMSUNG. I trust this brand. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

If you really want quality then you should go for it super amoled display is too beautiful to handle so that's why if you really really e looking for a product which has beauty E and quality and battery backup then you should really go for it however I like 5 inch smartphones screen I am bothered that's why Samsung has not made of phone of smaller display thank you friends

As the caption by the company tells, it's indeed a monster. Battery is a beast. Started at 30% and played 4 battle royale games. Battery drained only by 7%.

Finger print sensor is highly responsive and even the face unlock feature.

But camera requires but more stability. If you have an extremely stable hands while taking pictures, you'll definitely get masterpieces. But if your hand shakes, edges become a bit hazy. After all 64MP at this price range is unbelievable. So these small mistakes can be forgiven.

Worst camera set up. Insanely thick and cheap built. Not returning cos it was gifted to someone and am kinda embarrassed.
‚Ä¢ ANCIENT CAMERA QUALITY
‚Ä¢ VERY THICK
‚Ä¢ CHEAP PLASTIC BUILD
Several other options with no such FANCY/TOO PROMISING SPECS.

I myself use two Galaxy Notes but now I have a different impression on SAMSUNG.

Why are some of the reviews mentioning poor camera etc? There is nothing much wrong with this phone. It is a good product and should be a smooth companion for an year at least.

P.S&gt; I don't play games on my phone. I wanted a great display (AMOLED), decent performance, good camera and a reasonably decent battery life. I got what I wanted and if you want the same, go for it too. Do buy a good case along with the phone because Samsung has not given a case inside the box.

Before i bought this product I've checked a lot of reviews and as everyone said it's good for people who consume a lot of media i went ahead and bought this.. This phones got one of the best displays in this price segment.. it's an awesome experience to watch movies and shows in this phone. And with the amazing battery backup of 6000mah we can watch shows continuosly for hours. The camera quality is also really awesome. I love everything about this phone except the charging speed.. it takes me around 3 hours to fully charge. I wish they would have added a much more faster charger instead of that 15W. Also sometimes the face unlock is bit slow or unresponsive. But as a whole i absolutely love this product.

The phone is really a mega monster and well worth the price. 128GB and 6GB RAM, 6000mAh battery along with a decent processor and camera is a steal at this price range. But my camera seems to have a problem where all the corners of the photo except a central circle become blurry and so i cannot take a whole picture of even a page. It might be a hardware problem in my device or it could be a software problem as well. Besides this issue the phone works great.

Only battery  is best and camera  is very  poor quality  and fingerprint  reader is slowly  processing  and camera front and back camera is totally  wasted  that Samsung  M31product so overall  this mobile  worth of 15000 thousand  so I feeled tham for waste of my money these amazon products  was cheating  for me thus duplicat products  for delivery for me so I was complaint  for court I already asked  to replacement  policy that amazon customer doesn't  respond  for me and another  one time call doesn't  responds  that sir was tell replacement  policy not accepted tell so totally  Amazon products  was cheating for ever one people I was share that the a duplicate  product  for amazon for WhatsApp ,Instagram, Facebook,and ect  so be carefully  to order  for amazon totally  cheating ever one .

Nice product within 16K, although when compared with other options available in market this might not be immediate choice but believe me you will not regret being an Owner of Samsung M31.

Amazing quality of camera have already made me cameramen within my circle and a selfie geek, Battery is as promised, works whole day with just 50% with extensive use of GPS and WIFI and well as internet. What more can be asked for 16k when you are getting 128 GB and 6 GB memory with perfectly great fingerprint sensors and face lock.

Only cons I found: Weight should have been a bit less and size is not very much comfortable with skinny pants.

Overall, best handset in recent times and would always be looking for new models of Samsung within this price range. Good luck Samsung.

Am only writing the cons:-

1.) Front canera quality 5years backward..(its a quality with 12MP micromax camera instead of 32 MP)

2.) HEATING ISSUE IS THERE... ALMOST UPPER ‚Öì HEATS LIKE ANYTHING....( EXYNOS chipset is poorer, past experiences from many users..i personally rely for a Snapdragon chipset... )

But This time i overestimated exynos &amp; i fail...

*Exynos is a samsung made chipset cheaply produced but most performed chipset are always with Snapdragon thus the phones they possess...

Exynos 9611 used in..14k galaxy m31...24k galaxy a31 and goes on i donno what they mean by this.. unusual distribution...

3.) Facial recognition takes time far poorer than my poco f1 but fingerprint scanner is ok but not that fast still ok...

After a long time I ordered  galaxy phone.,as such I had trust on samsung quality.i ordered blue colour.i found the look and feel of phone premium.its screen size is compact which I liked it very much.holding the phone is easy and light weight.amoled display is vibrant with vivid colors.64mp rear and 32mp front camera on this budget is just amazing.baterry 6000mAh is just too good.i was able to use my phone whole day and still had a juice of 20-30% left for next day.yes charging time is longer avg.2hrs.but compensates for huge battery.all other features like processor,finger print scanner and software ticks the right boxes.Guys go for it.

It's been 2 week I'm using the mobile phone,till now I have not faced any issues. Battery  life is amazing,if u are not playing any kind of game and using mobile for talking,chatting and for browsing the different website, battery will remain for at least 2 days.
Day timings camera clarity is really good, but during night time camera is not working that great as u won't get that quality picture if you are capturing anything.
Screen resolution is very good,and mobile has come up with gorilla glass 3 and amoled display.
6GB ram and 128GB ram is really worth for 17k

Overall mobile is good  if you are planning to buy the mobile under 20k and trying to avoid CHINESE PRODUCTS.

Speed is ok.

Pros:
Fingerprint reader works well. 8/10
Camera quality is best in this price segment.
Rear camera. 10/10
Front camera. 9/10
Battery goes upto 1 day on a normal usage. 7/10
Display quality is awesome. 10/10
Features provided are great. 8/10

Cons:
Phone hangs alot, Samsung must need work on hanging issue as it is still there in this device.
Also, I've got some issues with network hope it will be fixed in next update.
Samsung's knox security is missing.
Samsung please check for above and fix in next update as soon as possible.

I'm planning to buy one more if these issues gets fixed otherwise need to go for another option.

Amazing performance  with wonderful features are the highlights of this amazing product Samsung Galaxy M31.
Everything is just wonderful as far as the budget ( it's cost ) is concerned. This mobile phone will surely beat all its rivals with its speedy performance and cool features.
This time Samsung has done miracle in raising up M31.
Thanks to Amazon for providing Quality product, meeting all standard.
I hope Samsung Galaxy M 31 would be the mobile phone of the year 2020.
Moreover Iam extremely happy to choose M31 this time otherwise I used Xiaomi  phones for 8 years.
I would suggest everyone to buy Samsung Galaxy M31 and enjoy speed, performance and cool features

On the 11th day of delivery  of phone, sound of main speaker  get down. I don't know why but it's not very low. Even I can't hear the ringtone. Over all phones built quality is awesome as well outstanding camera performance.

Considering how much it costed me and the brand I invested in , I very happily and confidently say that this phone is precisely everything that the advertisement say about it.  It's been 12 days since I bought this handset and so far I have never run out of battery. My son and I both, have been playing pubg for hours and though there are super minor glitches which one can easily ignore..this phone has been awesome. The camera and finger print sensors are super fine and quick.

The phone appears more worth than its value to me.

If you are planning to  buy a handset, go for M31 without even a single doubt in mind.

The camera quality is really exciting with 64 MP quad camera capturing almost all details. The macro and wide angle options makes it outstanding for this price. However, sometimes when required to take fast actions, focus is being lost. Autofocus is not so quick as well.  32 MP front camera is a beast!!!
The smoothness of display and screen is highly appreciable and commendable and this will be the best in this price range.
Finger print reader should have been onscreen and the case could be ceramic or metalic which are being offered by other manufacturers for this price or lower.
Eventhough it is claimed to be 6000 mAh, draining of battery is quick and you need to recharge once in a day.
Unexpected crash of apps is also observed within one week of time.

Samsung M31 is a Best quality product having  the great performance and built quality is also good with the latest Android 10

 That is available in chipest price.

M31's comes with 64mp quad camera and 6.4 Amoled display are amazing.
Camera comes with lots of modes like
Slow motion, super-slow-mo, live focus,  macro shot, night mode, ultra wide shot &amp; many more filters.

 3 stars to it's battery life
Because  while using phone it releasing  heat.
Samsung  announced  that the new M31 will come with 6000mAh battery although the performance  is good but battery life is not satisfactory.
In other hand i will say that it has the 6000 mAh battery  but the charger  is 15V that is not suitable  to charge a heavy battery.

Recently I purchased Samsung Galaxy M31 on Amazon. I have been using this phone for past 2 weeks and here are my feedbacks.

Pros:
Color of the phone is really cool and looks awesome.
Loading of apps is faster
Front and Back camera is really good and output of the pictures are excellent during the day-light.
Audio quality using headphones gives you a different experience altogether.
Battery life lasts for 48-72 hours, if you are a regular user. If you are heavy user it should last some where between 23 to 36 hours.

Cons:
Pictures taken in night mode is decent.
The phone gets slighted heated when you are using for a longer duration.

I will keep this review short, and from the point of view of an average user. Moved from an Iphone 7 (poor signal reception, disappointing battery life). Super AMOLED display is very engaging, (reading books is comfortable, even in dim light) 6000 mAh battery, powerful camera (miss the OIS though). Only complaint is the processor, which can get overwhelmed at times. Keep in mind the form factor, this one can get quite large with a case on it. Most importantly, the SAR value is low (around 0.3 Head SAR). Overall, extremely happy with the purchase.

Well no doubt indeed it was one of the most awaited mobile phone of 2020 and I must say It was worth it ,6000 mah battery , 64mp camera and many more cool and latest features
But there was one minute areas where I believe the creature should have taken care of
  - length of data cable
No doubt the charger is a fast charger still it would have been appropriate if the length of cable was bit longer
Last but not the least as a Samsung user I never get tired of bragging the level of service you provide us at your service centre ..pls keep it like this always

I am very happy to review on my recent purchase Samsung M31 mobile phone.
Performance is very Good as it is having Octa core processor with 6 GB RAM.

The Display is Super Amoled with 6.4 inch screen which is fantastic &amp; I can say that No other phone comes closer in this budget segment.

The highlight of the mobile is its Camera, possessing Quad camera of 64+ 8 + 5 + 5 MP Primary Cameras &amp; 32 MP Front Camera. The attached photos are taken from this phone as the font size is so small to read, Phone helped me in reading see the clarity.

Now I will give 5 rating for its monster Battery of 6000mAh

Why I strictly Recommend others to go for this phone because of its lowest SAR value.

Overall my rating is 5.

Phone is a steal at current price, giving best specs in the range and lots of features.  Samsung has really worked and delivered a product which exceeds market expectations.
Samsung has done amazing job on the latest One UI. It is more intuitive and fast. Also, it works very well with all sorts of apps.
Of course, the camera is exceptional,  especially its  64MP mode which has good detailing.
The display also looks excellent as it's super amoled which was only available in higher end models until now.
Holding and using the phone is also very easy due to sleek design and less weight even with the mega battery. The battery backup is amazing,  giving me 2 days battery life on single charge with good usage.
Definitely worth every rupee.

I bought m31 as soon it was launched. Excellent  worth to the price. Camara front 32mp excellent I use for zoom meeting my clients call me said my picture is ver clear and sharp asking what brand phone I am using?. Back 64mp main camara excellent awesome and amazing photo are very sharp with out breaking when it zoomed  I purchased M4l31 for taking video shooting. Video shooting as clear as taking professional  video camara.
Regarding finger print is just one soft touch unlock phone and faster.
Battery (6000MAH) is wonderful. My daily usage in zoom and video conference call at least  3  hours at full charge battery usage only half from full charge. In week ends battery listing today's in single full charge. Worth for the price. I am happy on m31

My budget was 20k and I decided to buy Samsung Galaxy M31. Delivery was done on promised date amid covid conditions. The phone has a very classy design, even having so powerfull battery of 6000mah the phone weighs lite. Camera is really amazing, gives you extraordinary picture quality specially in outdoor conditions. Played some heavy games too and ran some heavy apps too, did not experience any sort of lag. Also, dropped the phone in a bucket of water by mistake just after 2 days I got the phone. I was surprised to see that the phone was working fine as usual. It's been a week I don't see any problem with the phone even getting dropped in water. Worth buying it, best option for this price range. Go for it, samsung never disappoints with it mobile phones.

This new Samsung beast is monster in every aspect i.e., monster 6000mah battery, monster 64MP main rear camera, monster super amoled full HD+ display, and many more.. This new monster is very slim and very easy to handle and use. 4 different camera lenses helps us to captureevery type of shot as we seek in a perfect manner.
Other phones Samsung don't give 6000 mah battery with the 64 MP camera and super amoled full HD display altogether at this rate.
15W fast charger takes almost 1.5-2 hours to charge this big batteryvwhich lasts for almost 2 days with normal internet and other uses.
So one must go for this M31 because at this price, this is the only one phone in this segment which provides customer all types of major functions at this rate.

Best Phone From Samsung Under 16000k...
It's a totally budget smartphone with Quad Camera Setup Not getting  any issues till this time.
Fingerprint Reader - Awesome
Battery Life - More Then Expect
Camera Quality - True colors, Real view, High Resolution and Wide angle Experience Gives life a pro photography...

Comapre to other smartphones like MI, POCO... Samsung Is best because Samsung is Brand.
Design, Looks And Complete Setup Samsung M31 Is Best..
The most Important Thing Is Super Amoled Display  It Feels out Of The World...

After using Samsung M31 I am writing review for this there is no "CON"s...
Love You Samsung  And Love You Amazon For Providing The Smartphone...
Thank You Team....

Samsung M31 is the best in terms of value. It has good battery life. If you don't have use of games then it's battery life is 2 days or more. It's 6,128 version is best of all. Camera quality is good in terms of true color. Their is no difference between 48MP Camera and 64MP of M31. Selfie front Camera 32MP is not that bad as primary one. Video stability is very good but video quality is not good. Slow motion and super slow motion video quality is worst ever. Overall I can give 4 star.

Plz don't buy this phone. Just after 12 day purchase, mobile stopped working. When I visited service centre, service engineer told me that operating system has been corrupted. They update the OS and mobile starts working. Then again after 8 days mobile stopped suddenly. When I visited service centre engineer told me that this mobile has serious issues with OS. Now this time it took 1 week to update. This is ridiculous Samsung. Why New mobile has this much problem. Nobody from Samsung is responding not on mobile or not in email. This is what you called international brand. To hell with that. Plz plz don't buy this set.

I was tempted to write a review a few weeks after I bought this phone. I have been MI phone before. With some research and my requirements I bought this. I'm not disaapointed.
What is good about this phone? The camera is superb. The battery is superb. But what I like the most is the display. With MI phones in the same prize range, the display of Galaxy M31 is much much better.

Cons:
Less OS features. Many of the software features are found missing in this phone. For example, short cut for taking screen shot doesn't work as desired. Facial recognition is a tat slow.

Overall: 4.5 out of 5

This phone is really good in day to day tasks. But it's processing power is not that good, sometimes it overheats while playing heavy games such as call of duty mobile and pubg mobile. As for the camera quality the daylight photos are crystal clear but the night photos are a bit blurry if you have shaky hands. Battery will last 1.5 days more or less and 2 if there is no Ga(y)ming involved. Oh and this phone probably has the best screen under 20k I haven't seen the other phones but this one is an one of a kind. There are some other small features that makes the phone easy to use too, so over all 4.5 out of 5 because of over heating during gaming and the rest is ten out of ten.

I used for some photos. It appeared just natural colour And wonderful images. I use multi-tasking without any interption. I am happy with Samsung's Galaxy m31. Battery is really what I was looking for. If you just travel for a couple of days, you really don't need to battery charge. Thanks for a giant battery.
Thanks to seller and Amazon for providing best service and products.

Well its my first time using a Samsung android phone. To be honest I wasn't expecting that good device. I wanted a phone with good battery with a great display and m31 is a total banger om this one. The battery lasts for 2 days and the amoled screen is amazing. Apart from screen and battery this packs a great deal of utility. Samsung one ui is awesome, tbh I'm loving this. I've played cod and mcoc on this and they run quite smooth.
Talking about some not so exciting feature is camera quality, on paper they look great but in original the camera is less sharp it's beautifys and soften the image. And yes it's little bit chunky in terms of weight. And yes it takes a long time to charge.
Overall its a great deal.
9/10 recommended.

Pros:
One ui 2.0 with android 10
Screen and Camera
Can easily handle day to day task - No issues

Cons:
6000 mah battery performs like a 4500-5000 mah might be because of processor
Charging speed nearly 3 hours

6000 mAh  battery  . 32MP  front  camera. 64MP+8MP+5MP+5MP  rear  camera .Also  has  samsung  latest  ui  .  and  6  gb  ram  ,128  gb  storage.  In  16000 rupees ,  you  can't  ask  for  more.  Really , I  like  Samsung galaxy M31 . If  you  are  looking mobile for  watching  series  and  movies , Samsung galaxy M31 is  nice  . If  you  are  looking  for  gaming , Samsung galaxy M31 is  good, although  you  may  look  for  another  smartphones because Snapdragon is better  than Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9611 in  some  points. In  comparision  with  other  samsung  smartphones ,Samsung galaxy M31 has  one  disadvantage  that  Samsung galaxy M31 has  front  gorilla glass  3  and  no  rear  glass  while  some  samsung  phones  have  rear  glass.

I would say this is the best smartphone at around 15000 rupees .
6000mAh battery is its USP. I watched two movies online back to back and still 60% of battery was available. With fast charging 6000mah battery takes a bit time but that is reasnable. 64 MP camera is mind blowing with for different types of camera you can click different  quality images. Its been two days I have bought this phone and surely I am in love with it. 6GB RAM is enough to play any mobile game like ping or free fire or any other.

I bought the mobile on March and have been using for the past 3 months.. I am a tehnological addict who would keep on changing mobile once in 6 months... Previously I was using Oppo F11 and  being unsatisfied with the specs of that model, I bought this device.. I am extremely happy about this device as the phone is really superb and an excellent choice for normal and heavy usage.. Battery back up is massive and no need to worry even if you play heavy graphics games and You don't need to carry a power bank or charger even if you happen to halt in a place for 2 days .. Display and Camera quality are awesome and comparatively better than other mobiles at this price segment.. My friend is using iPhone 7 plus and he is asking my m31 as exchange to his iPhone...I really love the Pixel and display clarity.. You can blindly buy the mobile without any negative thought...

It takes more time to charge and mobile gets heated up easily . One of the worst products the samsung has manufactured so far. Really upset with the processor and battery life.  More than 3 hours of time it takes to charge up.one day battery. please dont purchase this product guys . Go for A series in samsung. Camera quality  is not as good as A series in Samsung &amp; oppo. Fingerprint reader nice.

Phone is worth at this price range. Comparing to the phone i have used before like Nokia, the cameras of Samsung galaxy M31 is missing details in the pictures, but is good in low light. Overall the the cameras are really good compared to other Samsung phones in this price range. I love the full black body, when the phone is used in dark screen mode, it absolutely a great feel of having very nice gadget at hand - Hats off to the design here. Ofcourse, the display is superb. And battery life is really a plus on this phone. A great product to own! Though, the charger i recieved in the box is defective, its not working, i had to use my other chargers to charge my phone because i didn't like to exchange my phone just for the defective charger.

Galaxy M31 overall is excellent.
Battery üîã brackup is awesome cameras also good but work like 48MP because when i zoomed that time picture going blaring. Speaker  Sounds very  Good. But i need some more develop in software like adding more fingerprint two to three.
Anyways I Give five üåü star out of Five because i share  my feedback with you after 15 days of the purchased. It's my suggestion for you don't buy unknown Brand Galaxy M31 bit all Letest and C*****

It's a good phone. While switching from my previous phone - Nokia 6.1, I could say a little disappointed, considering the usability aspects - Single hand operation, Holding comforts etc.
Before purchase this do evaluate Redmi 9 pro too. It's a close match.

Pros :
Fingerprint reader is good. Comparing with Redmi 9 pro in which sensor is embedded in lock button, I didn't experience a usability concern because of face unlock.

Amazing display

Compettative spec at this price point for a flagship
Good battery life

Samsung galaxy usability apps - Better than Android one experience

Cons :
Heavy and bulky in hand ( Larger display)

Not looks premium like Nokia

After 4 days of use I can say - Mobile works well for Camera, fingerprint sensor is quick, battery is good, display good but there is heating issues in mobile, I am not comfortable with this, I am using Samsung A50 also and that doesn't heats as much while charging or using phone.

After update of software heating issues has some improvement  so I am again rating it as 4.

Hi, I have raised a concern already about heating up of device. When I am on call, mobile gets heated up very much and I am facing sever pain below my left ear.
After stating all this over the call (I used my old mobile to call), Amazon team has asked me to do troubleshooting and diagnosed my mobile when I was not using my mobile and  the result showed under control temperature of the device. I am shocked that even I stated so many times about my physical pain, they are not ready to place a request of return/replacement.
I urge you to please support here. I am not able to see any other option to return it.

Going forward, I would not be ordering anything from Amazon and will also suggest my friends and family too.

Looked up many reviews  and purchased Samsung M31 as I was convinced that this is the phone with the most robust battery. Nothing else matters at the end of the day if you don't have  enough charge left. So this phone really fit pls the bill. The photos are crystal clear and the the 4 cameras at the back give you several options for the same.But this phone, shut off the unnecessary notifications,  put a slick black screen to help save your power.The wide Amulet display makes watching movies and ott platforms a pleasure.
The sound from.the speakers are good and equally great on the headphone. Turn on the Dolby atmos if you have to giving you options for music, movies or sports. A great value for money at around 16000 rupees.

Amazon delivery was fast and it came a bit early. I have no issue with the delivery. But the phone seems a bit skeptical. I charged it foe half an hour and powered on the phone. Strange as it seemed, it goes directly into the boot option. I did the process again, and the result was the same. So I powered on from the boot menu. Phone got ON.
Then I did the battery testing with my old phone which does not support fast charging. Surprised to say, my old phone is charging faster that the Samsung. I tried that for 4 cycles. Every time the result was the same. Displaying 'Fast Charging' while charging doesn't mean that it is charging fast. Yo, I could change my wallpaper to "Fast Charging' and say my phone supports fast charging.

The specs is incredible on paper and when I bought it and actually tested it, most of the specs hold good. The camera quality and features are very good though it may take some time to focus on the object dynamically. Normal without zoom 64MP shots are amazing and so is Macro &amp; ultra wide. Though when zoomed the quality goes down drastically. Charging speed and battery life are decent enough and haven't seen heating issue until now. The number 6000mah maybe bloated up but the battery performance is good enough for a common user. The AMOLED display, security features and Samsung apps/shop/members are top notch! Overall, the best common use phone you can get for this price.

PS: the metal back of the phone is amazing!

Camera quality is 3rd class.
64MP is like 06MP &amp; 32MP is like 03MP.
Pixel quality of photo is very bad.
6K monster battery is myth. Battery backup is very poor. 15W charge is very slow.
Face unlock is slow.
Don't buy any mid range phone of Samsung.
It is waste of money.
I want my money back from Amazon.

The finger print reader lacks a bit in the reading and is a bit clumsy. Maybe more functions like M30 could be added with the finger print reader over here as well. The camera is a bomb with amazing clarity in all aspects. After all its Samsung, the cameras are always amazing. The battery life if you say is 23 hours maximum with all possible activities, videos, games, calling, video calling , zoom meetings and if the net is not used, then the battery backup stays for as good as 30+ hours. A great WFM phone, amazing features. Maybe, there could be a system update for lagging a bit even after having 6GB RAM for keyboard application. But rest all, is amazing.

The phone is 100% value for money but it would have been far better if the Samsung had used good built quality. The finger print reader is working fine. There are so many modes in camera which I think is so cool for clicking pictures and the camera quality is much better. Well you are getting a 6000mAH battery in this one, one shouldn't be complaining about the battery life atleast. The  cons of this phone is that Samsung should have given a higher watt fast charger which is only 15 watt fast charging and the back side of the phone gets scratches all over it if you  clean the phone with a soft cotton cloth only. The backside would have been much better if they have used glass. All over the phone is best in this price range.

Likes:
1) The fingerprint reader works perfectly well even if the finger is sweaty.
2) Camera is fabulous in each and every mode.
3) Battery life as defined by the tag is a mega monster.It easily lasts the whole day with heavy usage and can last two days with light use.
4) The display is amazing,it is an awesome experience watching HD videos on the SuperAmoled display.
5) The always on display feature that Samsung has provided is appreciable.
6) Dolby Atmos gives a magical music experience.
7) The light weight design with such a big battery says all about the intelligent designing of the phone.

Dislikes:
1) The face recognition is a little disappointing as it does not work up to the expectations.It takes little more than the normal time to unlock phone with this.
2) The wifi connectivity is a little slow

I am in love with this model..it's display specially the dark mode is just a killer one..no need to worry about the battery life..it's true that the word monster suits best to this one...even the camera has so many features that one will get so busy with its camera by using just its features and experiencing on it..last one if someone is a movie lover..then they gonna enjoy a lot by its super amoled display experience..

Currently touch screen of the cellphone is not working, with in 1.5 months, I am very disappointment with the quality of the cellphone, in this lock-down situation, How customer care team will help for replacement.

As I am Samsung customer since 18 years, I would like to hear from team immanently for solution.

I am using M31 (6GB,128GB), the performance is good but there is some problems:
1. Experience Heating problem, while playing heavy game like PUBG for more than 1 hour on the upper part of the phone.
2. Sometimes freezing of samsung keyboard.
3. Gyroscope is not much Sensitive as compare to other brand phones.

At last phone is good, not better choice for gamers.

üòÄü§óüòçüòòThis phone will definitely a winner under 20k segment phones. My honest review after 4 days usage.

1.Excellent Back &amp; Front Cam, PFA pics here.
2.Display moulded edges &amp; sAMOLED nice.
3.Big Battery, good backup for 2 days with mobile data on.
4.Performance is Above Average i would say. Still i didn't remove the cover so after removing the plastic cover, it would be better..
5.3 slots are sd card.. i bought only 64gb.
6. Normal ram usage is 3gb and 3gb free for heavy users
7.speaker is above avg.
8. Mobile weight is medium and slim.

I will give 4.5 rating. (Finger print could have been moved to front or side). I hope it will long last for 5,6 years...üòçüòòü§ó

I regret buying this mobile. it is much slower then my earlier samsung on nxt mobile. Also on this phone the network bar for vodafone network shows only 2 lines whereas on my other mobile it shows full network of vodafone. Worst phone . I suggest people not to go for this phone. It is definitely not a 6 gb ram phone. 6 gb ram is only on papers and not actual.

Amazing phone with amazing specs,
Truely a megamonster in terms of feature and such a low pricing.
This is a honest review.
Pro.
1. Amazing battery life.
2. Great camera
3. Nice speed with 6 GB Ram.
4. For storage i got 128GB that too in 15999 loved it.
5. Processor is good unless you are not a hard core mobile gamer.
Cons.
1.Slow charging,samsung could have provided 20+watt charger.
2. Phone heat up after playing game for long duration.
3.Phone back case is fingerprint magnet so better geta back cover.

Okay so I bought the phone on the day it was released. The review is based the first week usage of the phone.
1. Starting big just like it's battery. The 6000 mAh battery last for a day and half on moderate to high usage of the phone.
2. Camera - the quad cam setup impresses more than one can expect, specially the 64 MP mode.
3. The sAMOLED screen is blessing to the eyes. Brightness is no isssue even out in the sun.
4. With it's 6gb ram one can just stop worrying about the lag.
5. Even though it doesn't have a glass back. It still gives a premium feel.

And with the brand like Samsung it is a must go phone under 15k.

5. Display is also very good.

Tha Galaxy M31 is probably the greatest piece of design &amp; engineering excellence by the Global Smartphone leader -Samsung for its new/repeat purchase Galaxy users.

Having used the M31 for 5 days now I would love to share my user experience. Every aspect of this phone is unique, the hardware, software and the OS has been engineered par excellence and over delivers on its promise and commitment.

For non Galaxy users possibly this is the best possible opportunity to own this powerhouse phone at such an appealing price point.

Kudos to the Amazon India Team for the Product Management, planning, sales, marketing &amp; logistics support rendered with before time delivery of this amazing product.

Samsung galaxy M31 is sleek enough to manage with one hand and the I personally am fond of Samsung keyboard,it can be really used with ease when compared to any other phones of other brands. The battery lasts longer than other samsung phones like M30/M30s.The camera also gives us variety of quality shots ,the top most being 64Mp(the detailing of this shot is unbelievable) and also the price is so affable too .Its a big time deal and real one too as I can get a phone from  SAMSUNG with affordable price.

I bought one week back. The product is flawless. Build quality is good,amoled display make it equal to flagship version. Go for 64 GB if u already have SD card. If you already have Samsung phone you can easily transfer everything through samsung smart switch feature.
Battery holds good if you don't use this phone as hotspot all the time.

Touch sensors are good and speakers are fine.

Do not have any complaints so far except keyboard input seems lags at time hopefully some updates in future fixes it.
15k worth mobile n its worth it!!

Performance of fingerprint reader is very poor. Very very very clean fingers are required for the sensor to detect. Some time you need to try 4-5 times to get it detected. Many times it ended up with other unlock mechanism like pattern, password etc to get phone unlocked.

Cons:
Heats up a lot :
The phone heats up a lot along the upper body during charging and gradually the entire display gets heated up . you wont be able to make calls on the phone just after unplugging  due to excessive heat.

RAM usage :
Phone after factory reset with no apps running consumes whooping 3GB RAM .  So the 6GB RAM is a MYTH. You hardly get 2GB of RAM space  for your applications .

Memory : Out of the 64GB of memory , the system UI and OS takes a whopping 12GB of memory space .

Pros:
Camera is decent  and Fingerpint access is quite smooth.

Summary: Phone heating up is a huge disappointment. Not sure if the product is user safety compliant

Excellent price point.
Display is excellent.
Very fast processor.
Fingerprint reader is fast and accurate for the price point.
Camera is excellent. Sharp and accurate colors and image reproduction.
Battery Life is awesome. It lasts about 18 hours on hevay usage.
Microphone placement is some issue. Many times finger accidentally covers it, leading to voice not reaching the person at other end of call. One has to be very careful not to cover the microphone accidentally.

i am getting good display experience in using this mobile like i never used such a good display.
but some times
keypad got stuck and i just purchased it 10 days ago
once some error occured due to keypad only and it abruptly restarted. So not a good experince as per 6 gb ram.
additionaly
it takes 2.5 hrs to gully charge which is quite long time to wait for getting mobile fully charged
after fetting charged, it can last for a day but cant be more for sure.
it doesnt have any feature to hide our files by default like secure folder or anything else
i will not recommend to purchase the mobile
rest
leaves on you people.
sorry samsung
truly disappointed

Am unable to use internet and pages are loading slower. I saw similar issues reported for M31 in Samsung community website.
My family members are having same network inserted in different mobile works really good. I have done all the troubleshooting steps which I saw in the portal. It seems like some hardware issue.
I'm planning to replace my phone. Sad that I have to return and book a new one it's very time consuming.
Apart from this all features are good.

In love with Super amoled screen, it's just exponentially enhanced my captured photos and videos ,it also adds another level to my gameplying and videoplaying.
The 64 megapixel camera provides you all the details you want but I'm actually fan of its wide angle lens ,its just superb.
The ONE UI is always userfriendly yet with surprises and the last but ofcourse not the least BATTERY, oh that is literally a monster and I take the monstrous advantage of this during this lockdown. A very very very heavy usage needed to drain its battery in one day.
Monster performance ,good biometrics (both fp and fd) and a beautiful yet lightweight design makes this phone a worth buying at this price. Love it.

Overall the product is ok. What I did not like about the product:
1) Fast charger: It is just 15W. Although when you plug-in it says "Fast charging" it still takes approx 3.5-4 hours to fully charge. Too slow in my opinion.
2) Some of the preloaded apps from Samsung are very annoying. Specially the camera app has one very bad feature. After you record a video and want to see it, it starts playing automatically. If you want to scrool forward, backward, pause etc, there is no control. It has to open the video again using a different app and then you can control. Such an annoying thing.

1.battery backup  is really good i can use it continuously  for one and half day.
2.heat problm  very minner it can't  be feeled while playing  pubg and very smooth gaming  experience.
3.camera quality they low light photography  was amazing  experience with this ya there is little bit problm with main camera becoz while zooming or while taking normal shoot detailing  of objects can't  be seen properly it got blur.
N last the delivery  was very fast i just got it within 2 days so thnks Amazon.

Samsung Galaxy M31 - writing a review after 3 days of use. Mobile feels good in hand. Display and design is good. I was skeptical earlier about the weight of the mobile...but it is pretty slim and good to hold. You won't notice the weight.
Display is bright...makes it easier to read, pics look good. Performance is impressive...apps load faster...multi tasking is good. The mobile doesn't hang. Best part so far is it didn't heat under moderate to heavy usage.
Mobile camera is pretty decent both selfie and main camera. Night mode pics are good too...
The biggest advantage is the battery. Single charge came for almost three days.
This is it for now.
Overall impressed with it.

After using 2 days I'm writing this review of Samsung Galaxy M31.
This phone is good in terms of performance and looks.
Battery is okay, it's not run that big what the company claims. One more issue is with charging. Company claims fast charging but this phone is very very slow in charging. It takes around 2 hours to full charge.
Camera is okay in 16K price.

Let me tell you the Real review of this phone. First let me one thing which most imp. That I bought this phone after getting lost my last phone 'Oneplus 6' worth rs 40000/-. Now You can understand my expectations from this one but seriously this phone went 8.5/10 on my expectations. which is the big deal. Most impressive factor to buying this phone his Battery 6000 mah, 64 Mp Camera &amp; super amoloed screen and in just 16000/-.
Must go deal in this budget. This is very frist time I'm buying Samsung, after hearing many talks about lagging samsung phones.
This phone nohow disappointed me at all.
Superb deal in middle Range‚ù§Ô∏è

The Galaxy M31 turned out to be the most value-for-money budget phone from the Korean giant.
Samsung has once again focused on battery capacity as one of the highlights. The Galaxy M31 has a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, the biggest we‚Äôve ever seen on any Galaxy phone, no matter which price segment it may fall in. The other notable feature on the M31 is a 64MP primary rear camera.
The Galaxy M31 also comes with a number of other camera features, like AR Emoji, Super Slow-mo video recording, a regular slow motion mode, and a Super Steady mode that uses the ultra-wide cameras to record action camera-like videos with reduced shake.

I love it .
Thanks Samsung and Amazon

Like:
Value for money
Camera quality is good
Selfie camera is nice
Battery is excellent
Display supercool
Storage of128gb is giving much much comfort.
Screen size is good for viewing videos and reading as well.

Dislike:
Image processing can be improvised
4G LTE data streaming not smooth as expected. Even though we have excellent data connection video stream's buffering or cache is not faster.

At this price and brand like Samsung is a good deal.  Also it is Made in India.

Above features and quality. I am using Apple 10 XS. Samsung A31 is really packed with loads of quality and features at this price. I am not comparing Samsung to Apple but price to features here.

I was waiting for samsung "my favorite brand
 to launch a smartphone like this,  with this 6000mah battery,quad cameras and amazing amoled  display and now this gonna rock now
, i don't have words to say about the phone,  it's superb phone under 20k worth money

Heat at the top-back of the phone sometimes, but not unbearable,  just get scared as you're gonna have to put it over the ear.
Camera is good, a little smudgy on zoom, but captures good light and colors.
Battery backup on medium use good, full charge gives a day and a half.
Sleek in the hand.
Lag in scrolling apps even with 6+128GB is noticeable.
Wi-fi-Calling very helpful.
Product info said it had sim card pin, but box did not.
Too many system updates within first 2 days of using. Some apps crashed.
So happy to have a good camera smartphone but I believe it can be better with the 15k budget.

Camera quality is very poor, 64mp image is just a joke. Mi note 8 pro has better image quality compared to this phone. Do not believe paid product reviews.
Display is good and mobile is light weight though it has 6000mah battery.

I have been using this phone for the past 2 months,i observed though my wifi hotspot will be on all time, phone did not heat up appreciably.

The display is spotless and you would really enjoy watching movie....

Battery charging,every 36 hours i am charging my phone having hot spot on during day time

I don't do gaming with this phone.so i can not help you in that....

Camera did not stand up to the expectation of 64 Mpixel.

Performancewise without any snag it does our daily routine works.

Slipped out of my hand from 1 feet thrice... But working perfectly.

I feel Back cover is slighy more glossy. Girls would love it.

Short and crispy way :-
Pros -
1. Battery backup is like 2 days if you run daily activities which is very much required
2. Phone is lighter even we have a massive battery inside
3. If you have samsung forget about screen.. its always awesome.
4. Fingr print and face unlock is quite smooth without any hiccups

Cons:-
1. Charging is slow with 15W charger
2. Sluggish in multitasking even in 6gb

Overall its a nice package at this price range

Galaxy M31's camera sure lives up to my expectations. The picture quality in low light is awesome and the phone is comparatively light given the battery capacity. It took around 2.5 hours for a full charge and lasted for roughly 1.5 day on my normal usage. However, I'm a bit disappointed with the lack of IR blaster and One UI. One UI doesn't have out of the box support for things like internet speed meter and number of fingerprints that can be registered is limited to 3. Overall it's a good purchase within given price, especially if you're a camera fanatic.

Previously I had used C9 Pro compared to that M31 was little bit fast and the battery backup was too good. Both front and back camera quality was superb. Im using this m31 mobile for more than a month and usage of mobile is high, like i would use mobile around 15 hrs in a day(most of time i use it for browsing) after that I will put the mobile in charging overnight (1 time in a day). While i put it on charge in day time i have observed it was getting charged to 15% to 100% with in 2hrs for a 6000 mah monstere battery. I'm really satisfied in battery backup side and camera side when compared to my previous mobile C9 Pro.  Really worth buying.

I am using this phone from 06/03/2020. I was on tour from 07/03/2020, so I want a new mobile phone, therefore, I selected M31 phone among many new mobile launched at that time on Amazon and other platforms.  Thank you to Amazon who delivered the product timely before proceeding to your. I made my tour memorable with this Phone after capturing good quality of camera, videos etc.

Device performance is average... No lag, smooth performance...having little bit heating issue...

But most disadvantage is camera quality...worse camera performance I ever experienced... Snaps looks like taken from 2 mp ..there is front flash.. you can't able to use 64 mp inbuilt camera every time..ever 64 mp camera snaps quality is worth...when video stabilisation , wide angle or other camere options then 64mp shot will not work..and snaps quality become pathetic.... Today's in this range around 16000rs we will easily get a good performance mobile phone with excellent camera...

This phone looks dull also... I have wasted my money  please don't waste yours..üôèüôè

Ok first of all.
1.Do not buy the phone as they have mentioned 6000Mah Mega Battery.The battery works just half a day and is so normal. It's not even fast charging.
2.Do not even think of a good front camera.
3. The charger is not a fast charger.
Do not go for this for 16k.
4. Rest some of the features are okie.
5. Would be better if I get refund.

Awesome design of mobile, camera quality very impressive. Good to handle the 64 megapixels quad camera performs a great job
And the best part is it support wifi calling it also inbuilt with dark mode. And the most striking feature is you can popup many small windows and do multitasking which is very convenient Really great job by Samsung üëç

Phone is excellent. Battery is really good. Need to charge only daily once inspite of many apps. Fast charging with c type charger makes life easy. Camera quality is superb. Quad camera with 64mp gives superb picture Quality. One extra slot for memory card allow to increase memory without compromising on sim. My redmi had only two slots so had to use only one sim by sacrifying other for memory card.
Weight is the only thing which bothered me it is heavier  than my previous redmi note 4 phone which had similar battery.
Overall the phone is excellent and value for money.

This Phone (Samsung Galaxy M31 6 GB+128GB) has got everything, can even punch above its weight.
No performance issues, Samsung's sAMOLED display looks the best (simply better than others), battery easily lasts a day with constant use. Cameras take great photos too.
One UI 2.0 is beautiful, lovely to use.
Overall it has been a great purchase. Great Work, Samsung.

Battery Life
Camera  Quality

Above all three  functions are  working very good condition with best quality....
The product is very helpfull for me for  captured the best  photo  and Video recording  and  the battery life  is very best.
I have complete  the any movie  with two hours continue  with a 5% battery  de-recharging.
The future of Samsung  is success  the topest/highest lovely of the android  mobiles  with  a medium budget  range.
I hope  with Samsung  that  in future  many mobile phone  will  come  in India with a medium budget  range  (i.e. 12000-18000) with a latest  technology.
Thanks. Samsung  India.

Bought it on the launch hour. I am rating this after using it for more than two weeks. It is worth your money. I think, Samsung cameback  with a bang. Awesome  speck in this range. Don't waste your money choosing other vendors.
Both sides  Camera's are stunning.
Sound quality is very good.
Battery backup is coming for 2 days.
Initially felt bit heavy ..but now I am okay with it.
No lags at all.
 Just go for it...

This is by far the best budget smartphone I've ever used.The camera quality is amazing.The night mode on the phone works really well and it has various camera modes which are great.The gaming is also really good on this phone.Games like ping and cod work really well even on high frame rate.The battery is surely unbelieveable.The phone lasts for a long time and its cooling technology is also great.Video resolution on various OTT platforms is quite good.The charger of the phone is 15w and charges the phone at a great speed.Overall,if you're looking for a budget smartphone in the price range of 12000-18000 this is the best choice.

So far, I find this phone really good. It has very good features and I love the physical design of the mobile. It looks really modern and of high quality because of which someone might think that it is an expensive phone but instead it's really affordable costing just 15,999. This phone provides all the best features in just a single place including camera of 64 megapixels rear camera which is not available at this price by other brands. The battery capacity is amazing, 6000 MAH...a luxury for me again. And many more features that you can find in detail on Amazon mobiles category.

It's worth a purchase!
I highly refer this phone to others !

Thanks.

M31 is equipped with all the features what one wish to have in mobile. After reviewing all makes and comparison, I choose to have M31 and I must say, my decision was not wrong. Amazon delivered the product before their committed date. 6gb Ram, 128gb Storage, Octa core, 64MP quad Camera is more than enough. Functional Performance is very good. 6000mah Battery performance is too good. No need to charge even for next day. Camera also delivers good picture quality throughout day and night. Sensors like Biometric &amp; Compass are very useful. I am truly enjoying M31. Samsung has indeed done a great job by launching M series compared to other make mobiles at very competitive price.

After using this phone for 2 month &amp; more, I am giving this review ( a short review) after viewing this you can really impress with this phone,my observations are:
1.everyone is looking for such a phone with a very good camera quality,in this phone with 64 MP camera the images are really appreciable.
2. Now I come to its battery it has 6000 mah of battery life,which lasts a long ,in my recent days I watch movies,playing games but it doesn't last.
3. Now about its look, very attractive especially it's back with superb camera design .I impressed.
4. With the given processor it doest create any hindrance while using any heavy size gaming app.

So I want to say as I experienced, it is really very impressive with this budget.

Firstly, I am very glad to inform you that "Samsung M31" is the first smart phone in my life. Currently I am using feature phone 'Samsung Guru 1200' which was purchased around 5 years ago. When I decided to go for a smart phone, it didn‚Äôt need to think much about which brand I would choose. I Zen percent believe that I made the best choice. Because I am already well experienced about the quality, battery life etc... of the Samsung company. I got my phone last week, but I didn't started to use it yet because of its cuteness. Thank you Samsung for presenting such a best phone satisfying all features at affordable price for a middle class person like me. Thank you so much‚Ä¶.

The camera of this phone is really nice.The display of this mobile is also very good. I recommend this mobile to everyone who is in search of a phone with a good camera.The weight of this phone is also quite low. The only thing which did not meet expectations is the battery. Even though it states that it has a 6000mAh battery , it doesn't last for too long.

First of all
 thanks to amazon for speedy delivery service every time I love it.

SAMSUNG GALAXY M31 mobile is

multiple combo for every feature like

Great Battery life 2 days minimum.
Camera quality to much.
Speed performance like rocket.
Design look simple but effective.
Last not least amoled display like seven wonder color quality.
Finger print very fast.

Overall I am fully satisfied with Samsung.
And I am purchased Samsung very long time but this time Samsung give me lot of quality of product in normal price..

Thanks Samsung

Software - This is my favourite part. One UI is so far the best skin we can get out of the box. It is the main reason I bought Samsung phone. Fluid animations, a lot of useful features. Customisation options are endless.

Display - Best in class. We can compare this display with more expensive phones.

Battery - literally the highest capacity in mainstream phones.

Performance - Decent for gaming. Handles almost all the apps. Ram management is excellent.

Camera - This is my least favourite part. Takes reliable photos in all cases. 4 cameras on rear is exaggerated. Real world applications are really low. Video quality is good.

As a mountain  guide I always go for  a phone  with  a big batteries, since  there  is limited  chance to find  wall sockets.  So I found  this phone perfect do those  who live  off the grid's.  Plus  the camera it takes  perfect photograph,, thanks to Samsung now I don't  have  to carry  my bulky  DSLR every time  I go to an expedition. Above  are the  two main features I have  been  looking from a smartphone, screen  visibility  was also great when I was at glacier. Samsung  should transform this phone  into a Rugged  smartphone. And one more thing,  Image stabilizer during  video capture  was amazingly  smooth.
Thanks Samsung
And thanks  Amazon  for its super fast  delivery.

Superb mobile.. best mobile in this price range, best display, battery, camera and design, all too good.. must buy.. satisfaction guaranteed
I use this mobile last 5 days I fully satisfied,  I really don't care about charging my mobile because it stands more than 2 days with high usage of internet and gaming.
Only one negative I noticed is mobile is having heating issues while play game and charging but not too much,  this is so little while comparing to other mobiles like Asus zenfone.
I'll give 9.9 out of 10... that missing one is for heating issues otherwise I love this mobile.
Believe me Samsung never miss to impress you.
Thanks friends bye....üòá

The mobile is beyond my expectation except in one thing. It has good camera quality when you take photos in good lighting. And the night mode is above the average. Sound quality, I found it to be very good in all the aspect. Display, very good quality. Battery life, it does worth very much to wait for 2.5 Hr charging time as it last for more than one and half day for the moderate users. By the way I didn't check if it really takes 2.5 Hr to charge up. I just go by the reviews which claims the same.

And finally that one thing which has disappointed me is that this model don't have inbuilt music player.

Rs 16999 for M31 is worth for such a great product. It's best product in this price segment.
Camera quality is awesome I.e. its pixels maintains the clarity when you zoom.
It has best video quality even 50000 rupee phone do not have such.
Battery last for more than 2 days. Its processor is fastest.
I found 2 folds increment in internet speed with this model.
Touch is super smooth.
Shape is awesome.
Overall this product gives "customers delight"

* Nice Display
* Good battery backup
* Nice Camera
* handy
* Perfect for users who use their phone for calling, navigation , taking photos and all daily needed apps.
Below are few things I have observed so far.
- Taking time to get it's battery fully charged.
  6000mAH battery  could  be the reason it.
- Not getting  a perfect screen gaurd so far. Looks like it will take some time
Over all good phone to have  :)

I have been using this mobile from one month. Below is my review about all the features.

1.Camer Quality is Good
2. Fingerprint reader is so quick
3. Phone display is good
4. Sound system is upto the mark
5. Battery: if you are using continuously, the battery would work upto 1 day.

Con: Only issues that I am facing is,
while using WhatsApp, in middle of a conversation, phone is hanging for 2 mins with no reason. Not sure, what's the problem is but it happend to me many times with in this short time.
I request Samsungs to overcome this issue in the next update.

If display and battery is what you demand from your phone with a pretty decent camera you can go for Samsung M31. If you are into lot of games and stuffs and you go on for hours playing PUBG and other heavy games then this device might be a nightmare for you. Personally my opinion is to opt for a Samsung phone always instead of Chinese smartphones because of smooth UI experience and less bloatwares.
The crisp sAmoled display will let you stare at it the whole day and still consume less battery and eyesight. Don't research just go for a Samsung phone straight away.

Samsung mobile are for mature people like from 28yrs and above, who don't game like teenagers.
Best screen
Best ui exp
Mature user doesn't push a mobile to its processing limits so its good if u r not a gamer like me, and good screen gives u pleasure every time u look at it.
Good camera, not outstanding, but good for social media uploads, night cam is not good, but we rarely photograph during night

disappointed.
Battery is big but useless. My phone dint last even for whole daytime with full charge with normal uses.
Camera is below par. You could get better camera in less adevertized phones.
The biggest negative is its microphone and speakers. I had to return the phone because of it. Very low sound output and microphone is horrible.
Though the phone has super amoled screen, the colours looks like you are watching a CRT monitor TV.
So Disappointing that I dint even use the phone for 2 days and returned.
Never reccomend it to anyone.

Fingerprint sensor needs to be more robust. Battery charging time is more even though claimed to be fast charging. There are very many options as double tap sleep which is not available here, whereas in similar price range phones we get lot of options/features. One important thing is the charger cable length is too short, not up to the standards of Samsung. Samsung - if you are unable to provide decent features/options in this price range, please don't roll out mobiles here and downgrade your standard.

The phone is great in this price range.
The 4 reason that attracted me to buy this phone is
¬∞ The brand name itself
¬∞ 64 mp mega camera
¬∞ 6000 mAh mega battery
¬∞ Samsung Amoled display

The camera quality is great, i tried slow motion video and the outcome was nice actually.

I bought the 6/128 gb variant, it's pretty good.

2 things i felt bad with in the 3 days is
¬∞ first day itself the phone was getting hot, thats because an update and initial setup of the device
¬∞ I couldn't find the network speed indicator in settings. Because in this internet generation we need to assure that we're getting enough speed for network.

Overall its a mega monster with in this price range.

Such a Intelligent Product.
Prons.
*The Phone consist of excellent Camera.
*The Battery Backup is too good in this price.
*Sree Resolution and Screen Presence is Excellent.
*Fast fingerprint and Face Recognition is beyond imagination.
*Top on this price range.
*Adapt to all Gaming modes.
Cons.
*This mobile doesn't look a Premium Phone.
*Takes around 2.45hours to charge from 0 to 100.
*A little bit of heat while using Games and Camera.

But the overall rating from me is 4.5 out of 5. The Product is way beyond excellent in this price range.

Amazing phone for samsung lovers, one ui is so smooth and feature rich,
Camera is superb, selfie are social ready and rear camera combination has ton of features.
The exynos 9611, old processor but powerfull, gives the power for daily use as well as decent gaming.
Battery is monsterous 6000mah, backup is very good. Although the charging wattage should be high but its still better with samsung charging technology.
Network conectivity is very good. I am getting extra speed on network as well as wifi compare to the same price range devices.
Ultimately a very good mid range phone.

I purchased this phone on its launch day and after 2 months im writing review.
Great phone under 20k and in terms of performance this smartphone will not disappoint you.
FullHD infinty AMOLED display will give you great experience while playing games.
Its 64 mp camera gives you amazing experince while clicking pics on daylight. Night mode in lowlight will not dissappoint you and also 5mp macro camera gives you different level of photography experince. In short quad camera gives you so many option to explore your photography skills and camera quality is amazing in this range.
In this range samsung M31 gives you really great features.

The overall product is good but there are pros and cons of the product
Pros- 1- The display is one of the best display compared to any other smartphone in this budget
2- The audio quality is also very good with dolby atmos
3- There are lot of features in this phone so its very convenient  to use in your daily usage

Cons-1- There should be improvement in battery its 6000mah and of medium  usage it last for atleast a day. Should improve the stability through update.
2- There is bit issue with the network signals that can also be fixed through update
3- front camera quality should be improved. But the rear is the best

Camera quality is very good but at the low light front and back camera performance are not good...

Battery is good but its charging time is very bad....(0% to 100% charging time = 2:30+ hours)....(work 1.2 or 1.5 days at normal uses)
Fingerprint work fast but sometime it's not work... you need to clean your hand and then try...
This phone is not for a gamers ...
This is for a normal user...
I am a normal user... and i write this review after 50 days of use....
Otherwish this phone is the best phone for Samsung Lover....
If you not a gamer and need a good phone for normal uses thn try it üòä

Pros:
1. 6000 mah battery is good.
2. Camera is awesome, mainly wide angle shots are superb
3. Previously I didn't use Samsung, I don't know about its display. But now I'm using it and sAMOLED display is awesome.
4. Dolby audio is available for earphones.
5. Android 10 is available.
6. Heat dissipation is less.
7. I bought 128GB version, and in that 116GB is available for me.
8. For full charge it is taking 2 - 2 and half hours.
Cons:
1. As the phone is having single speaker, so Dolby audio not available without earphones.

As I don't play games, so I don't think processor bothers me much.

Really this phone has monstrous battery, gives almost 2 -2.5 days power backup and phone has best camera available within this price range tooks awesome pics and the most highlighted thing about this phone is it's super AMOLED screen...woow Samsung cudos.
Many people and yotube reviewer constantly cursing it's exynos 9611 processor but believe me man this processor is very powerful..dude it's Samsung they know how to tune it's own processor to work fluently with it's one UI 2.0 so this was from my end.
And please don't compare this phone with Chinese phone.(oppo, vivo, Corona"xiaomi" etc.)

Display : 5/5.
Camera :4/5 except in the 8mp wide angle mode the images get a bit grainy.Night mode is not good. No timelapse mode and manual mode in camera
Battery:6000maH runs for a day under heavy usage.
Processing:Average.This is not a gaming phone
Memory:128gb is down to 120 gb since system takes 8gb.6gb ram makes daily tasks a breeze but in heavy usage there is some stuttering.overall its a good midrange phone and the best one for the price tag.. Finger print reader is fast. Face recognition is decent.

My views may change over time, but as of now not happy with battery backup or charging time.

I was switching from xiaomi to Samsung as my company apps dont support xiaomi.

But so far not happy with supposedly fast charging of Samsung.

My MI Note 4 that is 3 years old charges faster than this brand new phone.

Also my old MI Note 4 phone that is just 4000 Mah had power backup for 2 days initially when I bought it.
I don't see any improvement in the new 600Mah phone with same set of apps installed. Not sure where the extra
2000Mah charge is wasted

Great battery life...stand by more than two days.... great audio quality.  Multiple functions and hang-free usage.
Camera quality is absolutely mindblowing...not just the rear 64mp quadcam even the front cam is awesome.
Fingerprint reader is comparitviley superb in its quality and functionality.
Nice display and very handy smartphone.
Just go for Galaxy M31 - it's a beautiful piece of tech...!

Do not buy if u want peace of mind. good battery , good display and performance. But it drives me crazy whenever I use it even feel like breaking it. Every Time makes a call it go to auto hold minimum two times and every time it goes to auto record . It  drives you crazy . Samsung should stop making such technological nuisance. Really a piece of crap. I need my money back

Have been using this phone for 3 days and must admit it has lived upto its nam,  truly a mega monster. The battery needs no introduction neither does the super amoled display ,what does need to be looked at is the speed of facial recognition and the processor.  If you are a heavy gamer then this phone is not for you ,if you are a student with media consumption then it is best for you . The exynos 9611 processor though a bit slower toh snapdragon counterparts in this range ,the 6GB Ram does the thing for you ,makes multi tasking smooth. Rest all things like speaker and signal strengths are excellent as well, overall it's a value for money product

Amazing phone, I am not much into heaving gaming, I usually watch movies n take random pics, is perfect for my usage.  Coming to camera its damn good n best thing for me is it takes natural color pics.....not too much boosted colors. And the display is super AMOLED  screen, best for a movie experience. Software experience is too good and smooth too....no lags.....Battery is the king here. Easily lasts 1¬Ω day. If u use less than average might last for 2 days too...... just go for it If u r not into too much of gaming.
Amazon delivery was good no issues

Such a awesome phone at a good price. The battery is big beast and even camera can be seen like fabulous, images are such a beast one's and night shot is lit. I loved this phone and everyone should read this review and should buy this mega monster. Pros: 1. Good camera 2. Big battery Even it lasts 3 days and for standby it may lasts for 5 to 6 days 3. Big storage 4. Super amoled display is lit. 5. For gaming its beastPUBG works like cool on this one ,even on hdr ultra settings i got no frames drop. 6. One UI 2.0 is best UI in this category. Cons: 1. Slightly heats up while charging. I'll declare that this phone is the best phone at this range.

Wonderful phone, the screen has amazing contrast levels and produced vibrant colours even in bright sunlight and with a very good processor along 6GB of ram and 128 GB of storage, performance, launching apps and switching between them was quick, Battery life was excellent with 6000 mAh juice, 15W fast charger and with samsung‚Äôs One UI 2.0 based on Android 10 it feels good and camera has 64MP wide-angle camera, a 5MP depth camera, a 5MP macro lens and an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens and live focus is asm and works great in low-light conditions, too and it has a 32MP front-facing camera with AR Emoji feature which is cool and its worth the money.

Phone performance is really very good, not stacking or hanging during multiple app operation. Battery is also very good. But the camera 64MP is not up to the mark compared to oppo/vivo 48MP. But camera is good.
SAR value is very low and its a very good point to buy this mobile. Overall very good mobile phone  in this budget.

It's been only 15 days and the device not working. I got it delivered on 16/03/2020 , 3 days back i  wrote a review in which i gave 5 star now changing it to 1 star. today near about 2pm the screen of the device stop working, everything seems fine except the device is not responding to touch, it is still in such a mode that i am not able to use it. I did a factory reset but the problem has not solved, now right side touch works intermittently and the left side is not working at all. it has no damage on display but its not working. I am regretting that i bought this phone. I should have given 0 star not unfortunately that option is not available.

Body is sleek and light  cameras are good processing is fine and quiet fast, long battery life when you have fully charged  and  UI is nice and interesting  .

Its take time to charge because it has 6000 MAH  battery

And during  charging it got heated
Over all I find  this phone is good enough in this budget .

You can just tap the finger to register your print and the phone unlocks lightning fast.

As far as the cameras are concerned, the Samsung Galaxy M31 on the rear packs a 64-megapixel primary camera with an f/1.8 aperture; a second 8-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture; a third 5-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a fourth 5-megapixel camera with an f/2.4 aperture. The rear camera setup has autofocus. It sports a 32-megapixel camera on the front for selfies, with an f/2.0 aperture.

This phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery.

It is a best phone in the range of 15000. Fingerprint reader of m31 is great it just takes a moment after touching your finger to the sensor. Its battery is awesome, I can't believe that it has 6000 mAH battery. Camera is mind blowing, 64 MP camera in such a low price. What more I say about m31.... Thank you Samsung for manufacturing this device in such low price.

It was good for about 10 days thereafter there are many issues. Everyday new prob n I am unable to take this to nearby samsung galaxy center as all shops are closed due to corona. Last 3 days it was restarting after every 5 min then I did factory data reset twice but issue did not solved. Then again there is issue with speaker. If i get any call phone doesnt ring even full volume is on. If i answer or make any call unable to listen to the person on the other side of the phone. No video n no music as if it has gone mute.

I bought this as it was completing my smartphone specification needs.
Loved camera and audio quality when I use video recording.
From my point of view getting sAMOLED and 64 MP quad camera setup at this price point is a steal deal.

When it comes to some more needful things, I would love it if it comes with in display fingerprint reader and charging adapter with more output for fast charging because it takes time to charge massive 6000 mAh battery which I took one or one and half day to drain after office uses and PUBG session.

Talking about design it feels sleek and premium because of shiny finish.

As a proud owner of Samsung Galaxy M31, I wish to say this is the best phone I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs a high end phone with ‚Äòtotal value for money‚Äô.
Compared to other phones in the same price range, it has the best features, especially the camera, 64 MP photos look really good ; it also has macro mode to take close pictures of small objects and it has a wide angle camera too, which can take photos with a large field of view.
It has loads of features and One UI is very customisable.

Well done Samsung !!

Good Smartphone, looks great when not using any back cover. Battery is awesome. Display is good and crisp. Camera is good though a bit disappointed on picture comparison with other smartphone within range as colors are little offtone. May be have not much clicked photo in daylight bright condition where clicks can be taken for any occasion or photography can be done.
Good features like dark mode,Dolby atmos, smart view. Camera macro shot is amazing.
Back panel attracts fingerprints.
Overall good phone.

I am a fan of Samsung mobile. Earlier I had Samsung on8 phone which was good. I wanted a phone with a large display and large storage. So I decided to go for Samsung m31. This is the best mobile at this rate. Display is great, camera is good with good pictures. Capacitive touchscreen is smooth, fingerprint scan is great, face detection is good, quality of phone is good and lightweight. Battery is superb. Phone does not heat too much but I am not sure about gaming which I do no use much. Connectivity is great as well. So if you want a mobile with these kind of features then go for this.

The Camera Quality is really good but I hope there could have been more options in the camera settings and the fingerprint reader is quite quick and efficient and the full HD full screen display is too good for viewing videos , shows, films etc . What is Dislike is the battery which could have been better. The battery power is said to be 6000 mah but it isn't lasting for a day sometimes . The Battery is draining a bit fast while using mobile data or Wifi ! Overall I would rate this phone 4 out of 5 stars ! Thank you for this amazing product ! The Operating system is quite good but almost similar to the previous samsung smartphones.

Samsung galaxy m31 is a great package for the people who are on there mobile phone all day . There are many things that I like one is the super amoled display the battery and pubg for 6h a day it supports the highest graphics setting in pubg and smooth experience in day to day use . I think its the best phone in this budget segment. Not only this how can I forget the camera which is fantastic the wide angle shots and the 64 mp main shooter it amazing the picture didn't need and editing.  I am using this device since it was launched and now it is 2 weeks no issue at all . I hope you will like my review and suggest this  phone to you

Bought this a couple of days back., The overall performance is extraordinary. The mobile runs  very smooth. The fingerprint sensor is quite fast. The mobile battery back up is excellent, can run easily for a minimum of 2 days without charging. I've not faced any heating issues as of now.  The picture quality is fantastic. In love with this product.. Samsung is a popular brand but the popularity didn't come easily., I've bought the ocean blue varient which looks extremely classy and elegant... Would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an amazing phone... I feel it is all that an amazing high quality phone should have

The review after usage of 15 days.
Build quality is good as per 16k price range.
Battery life is around 1.5 days in average usage &amp; network conditions.
Camera quality seems OK.
Fingerprint sensor is fast enough.
No idea about Processing and RAM as I have not tested on heavy Gaming performance.

Overall, nice product on economy range by Samsung.

Positive -After long time Samsung M series came up as per user requirement with budget cost.
Having ample features in this cost.
Good product M31 within 15000 cost.

Negative-Observed problem in mouth  piece of micro phone so many of the time voice do not reach to other end and had to use speaker of the phone .there are multiple reviews also on this and many of the users faced this issue.Samsung should update the software if this can be fixed through that else this is very big drawback in M31.
Some of the application hangs with this phone Google pay is one of them.

Should appriciate the effort made by samsung on M31,
If u are a tiktoker, vlogger, camera lover, this phone is for you
There are many phones with good cameras and yes better than Samsung M31 but you will not satisfy as this beast make you satisfy with the features like super slowmo, slowmo, macro, nightmode etc
The best part is, the person who doesn't like his face or he is camera shy and loves doing vlogs, AR emoji will help him to creates his face and you can do video on it.
With AR emoji u can do some awesome tiktok as well.
You can visit my tiktok ID for videos @hemantmachani

Also appriciated Amazon quick delivery, not a prime member but still i received this phone in 2 days.

A handy Handset with good design proportions.

Design wise nothing great

Good camera with Depth, wide angle features.
Night camera is also good for price.

15hrs on screen time with Wi-Fi on.

Battery charging speed is too slow..
0-100 2hrs 45mts.

Network accessibility is less compared to xiomi phones and all

Phone was too good and worth for its price.. I'm writing this review after using the phone for more than a month.. till now no issues with its battery life.. I think the time period which I used is enough to make conclusion about battery and coming to screen resolution, camera quality, sound quality, performance, browsing efficiency.. everything was good till now.. the only thing I miss was earphones and protective case.. it would be very appreciative if Samsung provides earphones and protective case like how vivo is providing.. other than that no issues.. I was happy with the mobile!!!

Mobile is nice.. Specially quad Camera. If portrait images are so awesome. Camera night mode is much better than other mobiles of this range. Battery backup is good. Finger print is nice. I think in M series this is the best mobile. Gaming experience  like punh is also very impressive on this processor. Overall mobile is worth it on this price.

Need to improve in camera quality, though the camera is 64 mp but picture quality is not that much good as 64mp or 32mp, front camera picture is little bit hazy,  overall performence is good but need to work on picture quality  of front &amp; back camera, battry is good , if you use the phone with heavy apps &amp; browsing all the time in a day you can get the battery backup one day after full change but not more than that. Application , memory optimization is good. Mid range good phone &amp; Amazon delivery service is good

System:
System UI Stopped - my phone encounters this issue often and gets shut down in the mid of a phone call or at times of camera usage and restarts after a couple of long minutes. Moreover, the phone gets heated up too often with minimal usage of surfing (no gaming).
Camera: Not as promised. Not worth a single rating as the pictures are distorted when taken at night.
64MP (no zoom ) fails in comparison to a 16MP cam quality ....the picture taken are sharp and blurred when zoomed.
The only good thing is fast charging and battery life. Overall M31 is an average phone with nothing as promised by Samsung.

General review - If you are looking for mobile which would long last without further then your search ends here . Because it's battery life is better than anyone in market.

Battery life - best in market

Sound - not laudable but good quality sound

Screen - awesome full screen display

Fingerprint reader  - would have been great if it had screen inline touch otherwise back screen touch is also fast.

Camera quality - good camera quality but best thing is its wide angel view.

I was iPhone user but after looking at its feature I want to say big thanks to Samsung.

Samsung M31 is the best ever mobile I found till now with "6000 mAh" monster battery, superb "64 MP Quad Camera", sAMOLED Amazing display, 6GB RAM and 128GB storage very quick fingerprint reader and many more.

But there are some things that I'm not happy about is,
Every mobiles comes with back cover but Samsung didn't included it.

Also, till now in my family we have 5Samsung  mobiles all came with headphones. But this mobiles didn't came with headphones its literally made me a little sad.

Hopefully this mobiles will last long. This is really a under budget mobile that you all can buy.

Excellent phone in budget. I used M30s previously I am not satisfied with camera on M30s. That has been taken care in this M31 and even the speed on the phone is also improved.This has the latest android which is a plus. You can tight away but this phone. Forgot to mention battery, super battery with more than 1 and half day backup.

This camera quality is not 64mp.  It is 8 mp quality.
This 64 mp camera in 3:4 ratio and available for zoom and flash. In night the camera is useless.
Battery life is best . It take 2.5 hrs to full battery from 0% to 100%.
You can buy this phone for battery life only.
If you think about camera then plz go another mobile.
In short -
‚Ä¢Battery = 5/5
‚Ä¢Rear Camera = 1/5 (64 MP)
‚Ä¢Selfie canera= 4/5
‚Ä¢fingerprint  = 4/5
‚Ä¢Screen view = 4/5

Finally  price is high of this specification phone.
Price should be capped rs. 12999/- .
Samsung and Amazon shame on you.

I post This Review after Using 3weeks. This is the Best Mobile in this Budget.
# Battery is Good. NO Heating Issue. Charging  Fastely
# camera Quality Is Awesome
# Storage: I'm Using 128 GB.  Buying 128 GB is Better than 64, Because Of it's high Camera Quality  The Pictures are so clear with Large size. So Definitely 128Gb is Best For Photo  lovers.
# One Of The LATEST Android OS Version
# Color : I'm Using Ocean Blue. Its Looks So Royal.... It's so Stylish Than I expected.
I'm so Satisfied with This Color Too.
 # Display : So Good
Over All This Is The Best Mobile In This Price

I bought SAMSUNG GALAXY M31  SPACE BLACK  6/64 about a week ago. It was good and performance also good but the fingerprint sensor not reading properly. I am getting little trouble with it. Have to clean properly every time. And the camera at this price is too high. Mostly battery life, Mega Monster for a reason. You can't get a mobile with this features at this price. And I love the design of it, light weight cool looks don't even need a back cover the glass was soo hard and smooth. Quality of the sound is good when playing music. The DOLBY ATMOS working perfectly when you use earphones. Totally satisfied with this.

Amazing phone! Easy to operate, finger print reading is so easy as now I can hold my phone and unlock with the index finger without dropping it. Saw my friend's M30 and was very impressed by the camera. Then when I saw 64MP camera.....! I had to buy this.

As far as the phone is concerned... It is truly a mega monster... Worth every single penny... The camera quality is stunning... The fingerprint sensors is quick... The battery life which is one of the key feature of this phone is also great, it stay for one and half to two days on a single charge... That displays is best in its segment... No phone under this rang would be able to beat this displays... gaming performance and all was smooth,no such heating or lagging issue is seen... Shots taken from this 64MP quad camera set up as well as the front shooter is also crisp and phenomenal... Overall its an amazing deal üëç

After using this phone for 1 week, these are the below terms which I found

* Camera is awesome
*Battery lasts 24 hours after heavy usage (watched 3 movies played PUBG around 3 hours and PES around 2 hours and YouTube etc)
*Speaker built quality is good
*Display quality is awesome
*Minor heating issue after heavy usage
*Full charge from 10-100 in 1 hour 10 minute (6000 mah battery dude)
*fingerprint is okay
*Face Unlock not so good in dark light

Phone is perfect for this price range. You can consider it if you want a good battery life along with good camera.

Company cliam that they provide Gorilla glass in their display but my phone fallen from the bed (2 feet) and its carack badly and another thing is that when i purchase my phone at the time of launch i received my order but same day the was hang and off automatically the back fingerprint sensors is not work properly i got a call from the Samsung company regarding feedback but no one call for your quality . I think the manufacturer need to check the phone quality.  I am troubling after the purchase this phone. Its too bad its not affect the particular products its affect all over the Samsung gooods and accessories.

Amazon too delivered very fast and there was no issie in transferring previous phone data to this one. Thank you Samsung and thank you Amazon.

I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.

64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.

Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.

Face unlock very slow.

Heat issue which charging and heavy usage

Full charge takes more than 3 hrs

Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking for good camera phone
go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality

Both front and back camera quality is very good, in night mode it capture better image than other mobile.
Front camera also support wide angle and slow motion video recording.
6000 mh battery is very good.
Display quality is awesome.
No heating problem.
It may b best if it comes with a charger of 28 wats.
Processor is also good.
Overall in this price it is a better option to by m31

I am loyal customer of Samsung .I have always chosen Samsung products because of its quality products. I was looking for new smartphone in my range,suddenly I came to know about M31 model, I made my mind suddenly to own this samrtphone. I booked the phone through Amazon as soon as booking window opened. I recieved the product in time. I am glad with the performance of the smartphone. I am very satisfied with Samsung.
Will look forward to more exciting products from Samsung.

Phone is very good to use. Camera is really is awesome. M31 is really worth a try at this cost. It has variant features. So lets talk about pros and cons
Pros
1.Camera- When I compared it with S10, M31 is superb
2.Battery-Lasts almost 2days of general use for completecharge
3.Display- Refreshin rate is really good and no lagging

Cons
1. Processor - They could have improved the processor. The only drawback i find in samsung phone is that heating issues.
2. Speaker - speaker is not upto a great effect
3. Fingerprint - They could have launched with in display sensor

Without these cons the really awesome and its a megamonster

I am giving 1 star as I Dislike this Phone, I have got the phone 1 month back and I got android update when I updated now this is showing issue "downloading.. don't turn off the target".
As per instruction I have tried with pressing down key and power button but this issue is not yet fixed.
Tried contacting samsung support and they informed this is known issues " OS needs to be reinstalled" at service center.

Heavy heating problem.
Network issue.
Downloading issue from play store.

I recommend don't go with samsung product or with this product, totally waste of money.

Phone hangs and some times Apps are hanging. Not able to open apps like WhatsApp or games. I need to restart the phone multiple times. Phone gets heated up and charging very slowly. don't know if this is only with my phone or with every buyer of this product. Amazon gave just 10 days of replacement, which isn't sufficient for an end customer to come back on the product, if it is faulty.
It's just not even a month after buying this phone and really struggling with this now. regret a lot about buying this product now.
Can Samsung or amazon do anything for this to resolve my problem? Can they help me?

Product is to good and meet's the user expectation. The #megamonster is not only a tagline, It's also fulfills the customer needs. The super-Amoled display is also good in this device. From my perspective the device is to good for customer as this device provide all the features like 64MP(main camera) + 8MP(depth camera) + 5MP(macro camera) + 5MP(wide-angle camera), all useful sensor's,  long lasting battery backup and sAmoled display.

An awesome phone for the price paid. Got it delivered within one day of placing the order. The M31 has a pretty interesting four camera set up on the back and the selfie shooter too is decent but the main focus has always been on the 6000 mAh battery which hopefully will last 2 days. This is the main advantage

I am very much impressed with Samsung M31 by its look and design.

By the way, the Super AMOLED screen is GORGEOUS.

 The battery life is really amazing on this phone. Even after playing heavy games for long and watching videos with heavy usage, the battery lasts 2 days.

This Samsung m31 is just awesome, I specially loved the wide angle option.And it just easily connects with our samsung smart TV, today is 27.3.2020 the quarantine day past 3 days we were at home watching  movies through smart view ,we enjoyed it.i think it's a awesome budget Mobile and I love the design, color combination is stunning and I was playing free fire for nearly two hours, it just took 20 percent of the battery it also can be used as a gaming device. Speaker was stunning. And front camera was nice ,I think it would be a great phone for vloggers, I suggest that every one can buy this mega monster.

It's a very good phone , I would rather say its value for money , the camera is amazing like it could even make hell look like heaven . The quad cam is one of the best in the market and samsung is already a company that's on the top in industry .Its battery life is what they say #gomomster if charged fully it could even go upto 2 days and on heavy use 1 full day . No other smart phone has a big 6000 mah battery and the battery being very big the smartphone is as light as a feather .The finger print sensor is amazing as well as the camera .Atlast all i would like to say is u should go and buy it right now .

Camera is really good. Both the front and rear camera.
Display is absolutely stunning. SAMOLED display.
Battery life is incredible and battery saving option works totally great. Used it for a full day and battery was still at 60% with saver on.
Phone audio is crisp and nice. Performance of the phone is also very good I frequently use a bunch of apps together and play games too, it does not lag. The best thing about M31 is it's User Interface. It's clean and simple unlike other UIs like MiUi which is totally trash. There aren't any bloatwares in the phone.
Overall a perfect phone 10/10.

Have been using M31 for a week now.
It is everything you need from a ‚Çπ15000 phone.
-An amoled display showing accurate colors.
-Exceptionally large battery, can easily go through a day even with wifi on.
- It has a good solid built quality .
- Best thing about this phone is its camera. Which produces accurate colors and take amazing pictures.
Will recommend this to anyone who wishes to spend this much on a mid range phone.
In comparison to other brands I chose samsung beacuse of Samsung's deliverance of a quality product and good chain of serivce centres across my state.

Definitely a value for money buy!! Can't get better screen at this price point. Humungous Battery size helps in 1+ day with a single  charge.
Have always preferred Samsung over other "cost effective" brands. Still couple os things that Samsung could have added to make it a killer proposition:

1. 25W charger with fast charging. Sorry Samsung, 15W charger take &gt;2 hrs to charge. That's not fast in these times.
2. Have been a fan of Samsung Pay. If it can be introduces to M series as well, even if needs some hardware it will be a great addition.

Overall, good phone in its price bracket. Stand out features would be Super Amoled screen and massive battery which lasts day and a half with more than normal use. Samsung brand backing is an added advantage. Camera performance is very good in proper lighting conditions. No lag noticed even after loading bunch of apps. It would be interesting to see if it can give same performance after 6 months of usage.

Final verdict: Go for it if you are not an heavy gamer and high quality basic requirements (screen, camera, battery) in limited budget are your priority. You will not regret your decision.

Reviewing this phone after 20 days of heavy use.
The looks,display, camera, battery life of this phone is really good.

I am not a heavy gamer but the limited no. Of games of Pubg etc.I played in these 20 days, the performance seemed to be alright.

The phone audio is loud and proper but it could have been louder, the voice output in earphones very loud though.

It is a really good purchase in 16k. Value for money.

It's awesome. Bt lot of features which was in m30s is still missing in M31 (contact customization) . The new macro camera is also very awesome and the camera performance is better thn all othr chinease phone ...
  Battery performance works like monster . Bt it consume lot of data in a short time , u will hv to operate with ultra data saving mode . The front camera recognition is nt too good .
  One think that stuck me ws that even buying 6 128 gb variant u will nt get a case..
Samsung is still not giving headphones with their phones bt why case..

One of the best mobile under this price. This phone is awesome. I have 5 start to light weight, great features, awesome photo quality with ultra angel, micro &amp; 64 megapixel is awesome. I so lucky I got this phone on launching first day sale. After using more than 2 months, I didn't find any issues. Battery life is awesome, I usually charge only one time in twice day . After heavy use of internet, gaming like PUBG, CALL OF DUTY, VIDEO &amp; WATCHING ONLINE MOVIE, still battery backup good . Overall this phone is awesome which give separate nano sim support means we can insert two sim in different slot

Samsung m31 is an full combo smart phone . I'm using this phone last 15days. And i really satisfied from this phone. Man highlight of samsung m31 is 6000mah battery.

Here i'm put some samples photos.One of the most amazing feature is superamoland display which one you never get any other phone on this budget. End of the end this phone is full paisa vasul phone

Fingerprint was too fast compared to other samsung devices and even some other brand devices.Battery was too huge due to which it takes around 2 hours and 30 minutes  to charge completely  but after that you can easily play for PUBG for 10 hours  so it tell how much you can get in battery backup and Camera Quality can easily be compared with latest A51. Camera has all option like slow mo super slow mo and hyperlapse.... saturation is best and you will not find any lag using the phone because it has One UI 2.0 which makes it more optimised. Blindly you can considered it for buying for normal uses.

Charging is also very fast. Just 1 one hour to charge from 20% to 100%.
Whatsapp opens almost instantly.
Samsung should provide driving mode feature in its phones. It is a very good feature given by samsung in some galaxy j7 models.

The Samsung Galaxy M series has gained a lot of popularity thanks to affordable prices and up-to-date hardware. Samsung has managed to lower prices by selling these models online, reducing distribution costs. The sub-Rs. 15,000 Samsung Galaxy M30 set the pace, and a refreshed version, the Galaxy M30s, really helped the company strengthen its position in this segment. Samsung has now launched a successor to the Galaxy M30s, called the Galaxy M31. You now get a quad-camera setup, an upgrade from the triple camera setup on the M30s. However, the processor and the battery capacity remain unchanged.

The phone mega monster is superb phone in this range. Here are highlighted pros &amp; cons points.
PROS:-
1) Camera quality is fantastic 64 MP camera is performing great.
2) Battery life is better. 6000mah is quite efficient.
3)face lock and fingerprint sensor is supper fast.
4) Super amoled screen provide you real experience of 4k video.

CONS:-
The only cons I have noticed in this phone after 20 days of use is charging is slow in comparison of other fast charging phone. But this is not a big issue for me.

I feel happy with Mega Monster M31 phone.

I have been using it for a week and the phone works aweasome.
Handy to use and gives a premium look as well, yes it is a mega monster, battery truely lasts long and the display which samsung provides is uncomparable. Quad cameras are working at its level best, night mode, live focus, HDR, Time lapse are the features which helps to wrap up moments and this phone delivers it very gently.

I never expected that I would get a phone with these huge numbers of features and the benifits, at this price range. You can enhance your way to utilise your phone with best multimedia experience.

I faced a big problem of shutting down my itself and taking toooooooo long like more than 45mins, booting up to turn on. And instructing me to factory reset the phone. In that moment, I really hate Samsung's mobile and pretending to throw against the wall by myself.  Still now I don't know why it keeps on doing like this again and again. I am facing this issue of shutting down automatically and booting takes too long for more than 5/6 times.
Face recognition is also not speedily work.
I can tell the display is superb and the rest goes well enough.

It's a great mid range phone with good quality camera and battery. Camera ( both front and back ) are really good especially the macro photos really gives good picture quality.  Battery can easily last for 25-30 hours with moderate usage. Gaming was also pretty smooth..  the two 4 core processors really make the experience smooth. Had some reservation about exynos processor before buying but it seems a good one after a week of use. Transition effects are really good and always on display feature is one which i felt good as i missed that from good old. Lumia days...all in all great phone to buy

I got damaged product.  I'm not getting battery Backup even if I'm not using my phone. Camera lens glass is damaged. It can be seen only if we observe properly.  No scratches or any Mark's are not detected but the lens cover is defective. Battery Backup is much lesser than my old phone having 3000 mah. I'm tired to return the product.  Samsung checkup app not finding my issue. I tried to contact Samsung care and Amazon service but not connecting

Samsung has tried to incorporate all the modern features of the segment in the Galaxy M31. It has gracefully managed to offer a slight spec bump to keep up with the latest trends. The company has proved the fact that minor updates can make a phone slightly better!

The M31 brings Android 10 out-of-the-box, a 64-megapixel rear camera, a massive 6000mAh battery capacity and an impressive 6.4-inch AMOLED display. There's an adequate amount of 6GB RAM and 64GB/128GB storage options too.

In a nutshell, you can go for Galaxy M31 if you want a reliable battery, an immersive display and camera-centric features packed in a handset.

One of the best phone from samsung. If you are looking for a low budget phone with high specifications, M31 is the right option.
Finger print reader works fine and much better than my J7 prime.
6000mah battery is the main advantage of this phone. Battery life is super as compared to my previous J7 prime.
Camera quality is amazing during day time and its not good in the low lighting conditions.
Games like PUBG,PES,etc runs smooth in this phone.
In my experience Samsung's Galaxy M31 is a superb phone in this budget.

Superb.... best phone in this price range and specially for samsung lovers... perfect in all parameters, both front and back camera is ultimate with aperture of 1.8, Battery 6000 MAH, Full HD super amoled display, RAM 6 GB internal 128 GB is more than sufficient for gaming also....

Also design, size and other outer paramerets are also very good

Overall the phone is good, but seems a little laggy, experienced screen blackout for the second time in my 15day usage, camera performs fantastic offers a great tone balance but struggles indoors in super steady mode, yet great details captured by 64&amp;32mp lenses. The super amoled panel is the might of the phone with perfect viewing angles. The battery lasts for a full 2days with heavy usage.
If compared with vivo v1x pertaining to internet speed when using browser and downloading apps m31 is a lot slower in terms of downloading as compared to vivo both running on jio sim &amp; same plans.

Phone performance detoriated within 2 months from purchase. As the memory is filled 32GB out of 128 GB available, the phone response has drastically reduced. Specifically face recognition, finger print sensing, switching between Apps etc.
Also not happy with camera quality (though I'm not an expert but when I capture normal clicks without any settings, quality is not so good which we expect from a 64 MP camera)
Battery performance is good till now. Easily lasts for more than a day after exhaustive usage of Web meetings, hot spot, movie etc.

Good Phone in this budget. Camera quality is awesome. Plenty of options to click the pics in live focus,pro mode, night mode. Very handy and the blue color is good. On the battery side, currently getting backup more then 1 day. Let see in coming days. 6 GB RAM with 128GB memory. Usually disadvantage of Samsung mobile is that it gets hung after some days.. But need to see in this mobile with 6 GB ram.. As of now NO hanging ..Overall Good mobile to buy in this budget. If People of bored of mi,honor and other mobiles.. I suggest to go with this mobile..

I have been using this phone for a week now and so far it has been great. I would rate the features as following:
1) Battery life 9.5/10
2) Screen 8/10
3) Speakers 7/10
4) Gaming -/10 (I don't play games and I'll  suggest you to skip this phone if gaming is your primary concern)
5) Camera (both main and selfie) 6.5/10 - 10 being Pixel 4's camera

One point I would like to add here is that though scrolling on this phone and the overall UI experience is ok most of the time, it doesn't feel very fluid. One can't expect everything from a 15k phone, I suppose.

Many of brands having lots of model in market even Samsung has many but in this segment of price, M31 is having best features. I am very much satisfied with it's camera quality, battery backup. Best part is due to 6GB RAM and 128GB internal phone provides very much smoothness in handling and data storage.
Only one problem is that I feel some heat when the phone is on charging and the same time i use any app but and in normal situation phone is fabulous. So from my side it is 5 in 4.9. Thank you Samsung for providing this kind of model in this price range with brand name of Samsung.

Don't buy waste of money.
1.Phone is very heating in normal use also.
2.Back finger print area surrounding body plastic is not proper fixed.
3.Very cheep type plastic body.
4. For this Exnos 9611 prossser 6000 Mah battery is not enough. 10000 Mah batter require dew to over heating.
5.Battery charging for full taken 3 Hrs.
Totally my opinion don't buy..wait for Redmi 9pro/Max.

I am really satisfied with this phone, excellent battery backup. Now I don't need to carry charger. Awesome camera on this price. Video quality is amazing.

Overall, one of the best phone I have.

One problem I found is the back panel it is of plastic and you need to take extra care of it... I was waiting for best back cover but till then I have my phone got multiple rashes on back panel.
And one thing is that, phone is getting on hold mode during the call. This is because, option button is getting eneble on right up side during call and accidentally it's getting touch.

But Still I am happy what I got.

Honest review
-----------------
This mobile is not for today's generation.
Basic apps are not available you have to install 3rd party apps (compass, data uses viewer, data speed viewer, ram booster, even default music and video player) you cannot lock apps to run in background.
Camera quality is ok not great.
Battery is not upto mark discharge very soon, faceunlock is very poor, speaker is also very poor produce very low quality and less sound.
Only Samsung brand and its display is ok.

This an amazing phone at this price point. I have been using iPhone 7 and Samsung galaxy s7 edge. This phone is as advanced and as a matter of fact has even more features (maybe because of the newer android os)
The screen is big and has a very good resolution. The camera quality is good as such did not find much difference from other phones except for the clarity of pictures.
There is absolutely no lag in performance.
The best part being the battery life which is superb. I am a heavy user and the phone battery lasts for 2 days.
To sum up: more than value for money.

Frankly, I like its battery, RAM, and the color variant. I am a big fan of samsung mobiles. What I dislike is personal. I am bored of using same buttons in settings. Else no major flaw. I searched 6000 MAH battery but only samsung gave me the choice. Only for a change one can replace samsung otherwise it is the best. Good feature is cartoon characters replaces your face in AR emoji I enjoyed it. Palm selfie feature us awesome as usual. I am not camera frenzy although when we took pics others were envious because all others cameras were at flaw and samsung M31 is winner. They my friends deleted my pics in jealousy :-) I am loving it more day in day out

There is sound defect ( problem  ) in the mobile.  Once we receive a call then the sound does not work, we are unable to hear any video. Then again we have to restart the mobile to hear the volume. Due to Lockdown we were unable to return the mobile on the given time.
So I here by request you to replace the defected mobile with  new mobile.

If I tell Truth.....Really i got more from expectation in this budget segment.
Performance is Absolutely Stunning in daily usage as well as in gaming also.
The massive battery of phone 6000mAh is give you full and half day battery backup.
And what i say of Super amoled Display and 64mp Stunning Camera, 32 mp selfie gives you smile. And also Samsung One UI 2.0 gives you a best UI experience ever . Personally I recommend to you go without doubt. ü§ó

Samsung M31 i have received on Monday and i can proudly say that its a very good mobile within this price. I was very much confused as samsung was offer 6GB ram along 128GB in this price range with  6000mAH battery, but after using this mobile i am happy to own this mobile. Look &amp; feel, interface while using mobile, battery backup, speed, finger print sensor and available usable RAM approx 3.2 GB (after loading most of apps) will give you a WOW experience. In 16k budget i an finally say its a very good phone.

Amazing Phone.  Camera quality is awesome.  Click the pictures and zoom in, pixels doesn't get burst.
This phone is very light weight, slim and gives you amazing feel when you use. Battery back up is very good.  I charged the mobile to 100% and played punha for 2 hrs, it consumed just 18% of it and most important it doesn't get hot even the multiple apps are running at behind.
In short I will call it as "Beast" in 15k to 20K range.  If anyone is looking for a phone in this range, go for it blindly.

A flagship budget phone.
Can't expect more from brand like samsung for 15k
Awesome camera. Make sure you change the setting to 64 before click.
Battery backup is phenominal
Great display you can get at this price
Black varient is more classy
Fingerprint and faceunlock works flawlessly
For me 6000 mah came 3 days for normal usage
Android 10 and one UI 2.0 out of the box is a great plus. Software is more fluid and fast.
Multitasking is very good. Samsung did a brilliant work memory management.
Just go for it with closed eyes :)

I love samsung devices. I purchased my samsung device in 2015 from Dubai and It lasted for 5 years... Still it is running.
Most thing I like is Camera. The photo quality is awesome.
Samsung Galaxy m31 price is worthy for such good specifications, most of space (128GB), camera  and Battery.
Finger print &amp; face recognition is security key to protect data.
The Most security function of this device is that if you pit it idle for 4 hours then you have to type pin number to unlock.. finger print or face recognition will not work. I like this security function.

The mobile by itself is a master piece of technology and the highlights are the camera's and battery.  Value for money and promise kept well by Samsung.  This is our 4th Samsung mobile we've bought through Amazon and all are working hassle free. This master piece outwits redmi or Huawei by miles in performance and battery life. The draw back is that its has a heavy built and weighs a bit. But Indian people like the reliability than looks. To sum up,  this is a monster of a deal.

This is one of the most fantastic mobile devices of recent times. With excellent speed and a monster battery which goes on and on, it's is truly a fantabulous package from Samsung at an affordable price. A lovely camera which beautifully alters and optimises your old pics. A good finger print reader, a device to scan QR code, the list is endless. Thanks Samsung for making such a thoughtful device for first time Samsung users like me and turning them to become your brand ambassadors for this lovely device.

I'm always a big fan of samsung. Becoz my 1st phone was also a samsung.
About galaxy m31:
1)Fingerprint scanner is awesome
2)Massive battery with amazing battery backup
3)Samsung super-amoled display is out of the universe so i fill amazing viewing experience
4)And no company can beat camera quality of samsung m31 at this price
5)I also like UI of samsung m31
6)Forgot all other brands because in mobile technology samsung is always on the top

First sight-impressive. Beautiful design with camera and speaker placed at appropriate  positions (big square camera placed right at the back of the phone takes away that stylish look- and which is not so with samsung m31). The battery life is too awesome; including camera, audio and video quality (battery may outlive me). The overall performance of the cell is excellent. If you are not a big time gamer in want of high speed phones, this phone is highly recommended. This phone performs slightly at low speed for some games as compared to other phones under similar budget.

I have wasted my 16000‚Çπ on this phone. Company show that it have 6000mah battery which is false. Its take 4 hours to charge 25% of battery. Too much heating issue. Camera quality is poor as company show it is 64mp camera. I suggest please do not buy thia phone. Do not waste your money on this phone.

Samsung M31 automatically restarts.. ram  processor is worst.. i have had a very bad experience of this phone.. phone slows down a bit then it hangs and which results in automatic restarting the phone.. bcoz of this i loose my data or the things I was working on.. i have been facing this bad experience since first day I received my mob.. initially i thot that some update might be coming .. but then lockdown began and I was unable to reach customer service centre. I hope Samsung will look into the matter at the earliest and provide a appropriate solution for the same..

The display is top notch and the best in the price segment. It's not so heavy even though it comes with 6000mAh battery. Software feels lite and not bloated unlike other brands' phones in this price segment. The quad camera and the ocean blue give a rich look to the phone. I have used the phone outdoors for more than a day with considerable charge left.  Camera is also pretty good for taking normal and wide angle shots. Low light photos are not as good as expected but decent.

Thank you Samsung for coming with this good product, and coming to the review part the major reason I needed to shift to a new phone was the battery, and while travelling this was my greatest hurdle to ensure the battery doesn‚Äôt drain out till I reach Home. Hopefully the monster 6000 Mah battery saves my day. The power packed quad camera also gives an edge over me while clicking pictures at various light condition. The biometrics is functioning smoothly and backed by a good User interface. The system is powerful and smooth and yes I loved it.

I would like to thanks Amazon to offering right price and time of delivery

Fingerprint :- By Honestly saying working beyond my expectation. Especially indicating wrong and inproper touches.

Camera :-  64 MP hels us to capture distance snaps with good quality and front camera is simply awesome for selfie.

Battery life :- No need to worry about battery life..I was worked my offical purpose it's stand by 48Hrs.

Over all fully satisfied for bought this product.

I upgrad my m20 with m31, this Blue color giving premium look &amp; camera positioning also gives superb design, excellent display as expected from Samsung, working fine without any lags, good performance in gaming also, it has sufficient memory so overall I satisfied with this mobile with this budget and feeling very proud to be a Samsung mobile user for consequent 17 years, started with Samsung c230 in the year 2003, now I am using this M31, always I satisfied with this brand. Thanks to Samsung.
Cons: Little delay on face unlock, no earphones  along with mobile

So disappointed with Samsung
-the phone is too bulky
- camera is so fake too much of beauty editing
- having problem with internet after using this phone whereas the same sim in my old vivo phone never had this problem.
- fingerprint not working sometimes unlike my experiences with my old vivo phone
+ battery is good

Battery life is amazing, probably the best within the category. You just charge once and forget, this is really good!!
I am not a pro in taking pics but this does the job just fine in the day light and lowlight both.Fingerprint reader sometimes doesn't recognize with the case. Probably due to the position within the case. However without the vase it works like a charm. I have tried many phones earlier within the same budget and have always found Samsung brand to be reliable and long lasting. Good job Samsung on this phone.

I am reviewing about this phone after 3 months of heavy usage.
I am finding this phone a perfect piece in all manner.
the most advantageous is its battery backup, SAMOLED display and DOLBY.
I am not fully satisfied with the 15w charger provided and Camera quality.
We can get 20 or 30W charger in similar range products.
But the camera quality is OK if we compare to similar range phones.

Poor Camera...
64 MP and 4 Cameras are showing up a promotional value only. Its Camara having not best option for manual operating. If i have go to 64 mp option then sum functions are not supported.
Battery life is 20+hours on continues using any how...
Others all the features are better in my knowledge...

I preferred to buy Samsung to avoid buying Chinese mobiles and this is the best android mobile at this price.
Better display quality compared to Xiomi models.
Camara is good, capturing good images even in low light. Macro shots, slow motion videos are also good.
Compared to prvious models of Samsung, sound quality is very good.
Battery life is good. You can use more than a day with excess usage.
One drawback for this phone is, sometimes it is getting heat on excess usage.

Samsung Galaxy m31 is totally as per my expectation. Touch is functioning acuratly. Camera quality is also very good. Battery is the most amazing thing in the phone. I charge my phone only once in a day that to not 100% but I easily get through all my day and half the next day.
But slow motion video quality in not good I must say that.
And yes amazon  EMI option has helped a lot to purchase this phone in budget as I have not found any EMI option offline on the stores.
That's it. Overall the phone is amazing according to the price.
Thank you

A perfect package of Samsung in all segment where one gets best camera, battery, resolution, screen, sensors, processing and I can go on telling what i have explored till now. At this price Samsung galaxy M31 is pocket friendly too. Its comes with great video recording and storage capacity. All i can say is that M31 of Samsung in Galaxy family is all in one mobile that one can dream of at this price. Extremely satisfied. Thank u Samsung for this all time great model....

After update from Samsung in April 2020, my M31 became brick. After 10 days, Samsung provided solution. But after then, mobile detoriated in battery life &amp; LCD screen became slight yellow instead of White. Asked replacement to Samsung India, but no response.

I am using this phone from almost one month.  Till now I didn't face any issue. Fingerprint sensor works well.
Camera quality is just Great. I went to manali with this phone and Pictures and vedios are of superior Quality. I love it's camera. Low light picture quality is also fine.
Huge battery (6000mAh) is given with this phone. I am a heavy user and for me it works more than a day. The only issue I feel is, battery takes little long time to fully charge, but it's worth once it's charged. I am very satisfied with this phone. Just go with it. :-)

I like this Product a lot because as a Customer we will definitely expect a X-Factor in all the products which we buy. But this Galaxy M31 is like a Customer Delight Product which will surprise with you its features (More Features which are basically available in Premium Segment Mobiles) and look at an affordable price . Definitely it is a Product which is Worth more than its Price.
Recommended to many of my Friends and Family and none of them came with any IFS and Buts till now.
"SIMPLY - CUSTOMER DELIGHT" product which will never disappoint You

The camera quality which i found in this piece is not good, seems like a faulty piece as when compared to the same other device it shows difference. The battery draining is also quick morr than expected in a 6k mAh battery, because of which i have placed a exchange for the same mobile. Waiting for the new one and hoping that its battery and camera quality is good as expected.

Finger print reader is so good as it very simple to set. That, which we can set  2 or more times, i like it

Camera quality is also very impressive feature in m 31.Im fully satisfied. As we compare to other 64 mp available mobile brands.

"Worst battery ".  The battery life of 6000 mah could not reach my expectations little bit.it acts as 3000 mah battery In m31 mobile, When I charged 100%,  it is decreasing within 10 hours. Without using to watch videos or playing games. Means, should have to charge again. Finally am not satisfied with the this battery.

Such a beautiful mobile and camera quality is ultimate...the picture is like a pro photographer...I have recieved my galaxy M31 in 1 day delivery.  And the gaming performance ultime..in this price. I play the pubg mobile in smoothly..but some times frame drop happend ..u should improve that in next update.
  And the look of the mobile is very good..and battery performance also nice (6000 mah battery) we can play the game for 8 hrs in 100 % charge...and normal usage is 2days ...
(Overall tha mobile is perfect) seriously it's a mega monster üî•üî•üî•

Front cam is bad. Finger print scanner and backpanel has a slight gap which gathers dust around it. Face unlock and fingerprint lock is a bit slow though. Battery works okay. If backpanel was also made of gorilla glass it would be better as it gets dusty and greasy every time u use it. phone is heavy. Back Cam doesnt look even close to 64 mp. The so called front screen broke after falling from a very small height and there is no backcover available and even repair shops dont have its spare parts

My experience of this set is really splendid. It has best features. This phone is so easy to handle and operate. Its 64 mega pixel camera is capturing such a nice and real photos. One feature I really admirable that we can adjust the frame of camera according to our requirement, either narrow or wide. Video recorded by this camera is so clear with best sound quality.
It has lots of internal storage that even no memory card is required for the storage.
This phone is new for me but within 4 days I can say it is my best decision to buy this phone.

Samsung as a mobile phone brand has always been my favorite.
Its has made me feel value for money.
Secured in terms of after sales service though I never had a bother to take my smartphone to a any centreas I never faced any!
My phone gives me confidence and pride too
I feel loyal towards the brand for the loyalty they have shown to me.

I have used my Samsung E7 for last 4 years now.

Samsung M31 has a very light feel. The look is just awesome. And again, I feel value for money. Beyond expectations. I am so happy.

Termed as a mega  monster this lives up to its billing when it comes to battery life and i have been using this phone for over a week and I am very satisfied with the battery life,the screen is just gorgeous  to look at  the best in its class I can say camera is also good please buy a cover and screen guard that's a must with this phone and charging  timing could have been reduced if the charger has better capacity , also would have been nice if there was a cover given too,finger print reader is fast but be careful if you have sweaty hands might not work

Really a good phone compared with the other`s Brands available in the same price range and Specs. Display, camera, Finger print scanner, fast charging some of the built in features are really good. Over all good.

Doesn't comes with Head phones or any other  accessories. On Samsung site its available for less(Don`t know how their delivery service will be).

Battery last`s for almost 30 hrs, on normal usage, i was in the assumption that 6000mah may last for at-least 40+hrs

Since 1 week I am using this so my review is based on that -
1.Battery Backup is awesome.
2.Display is just exceptional ( no one can beat in this price)
3.Camera  is also Good

Only thing I am facing is sometime it gets automatically disconnected from Wifi. Don't know the problem is in router connectivity or phone.
After software update that problem may get fixed I think.

Overall Best Phone. In budget and look.
Satisfied

Amazing phone by Samsung in this range.
Awesome touch.
Battery life is almost 1.5 days(normal usage like calls,messages ,mails )
Fingerprint -5*
Face unlock -4*
Camera - in love with wide angle shots.

Cons
I dont know whether this is facebook app problem or phone's but sometimes i feel like in notifications the first content is half hidden and you cant drag it.

Otherwise till date(6th day from date of purchase) havent faced any issue and in love with this #Mega Monster

Network: even if you won't get enough signals then also no need to worry about Mobile data and calling.

Camera: it's nicely with a high resolution. Selfie camera give nearly same pic as realistic

Battery: It's long blasting works for full day with 100%. Play music, games and whatever you want. But it takes 1.5 hrs to charge it full.

Look: it's good, look wise with smoothies edges. Gives you a feel of curve edge

I felt myself very bad for switching  back to Samsung. It is having all good quality as they mention in specifications. But I can't imagine  why it is generating that much of heat at upper half part of mobile. Very scary even to touch. Hope it will be solved in future with some system upgradation. Waiting for the same

Overall M31 6GB/128GB is a complete package worth for Rs.15999. It has best Camera &amp; battery in this amount.
But processor Samsung M31 has exynos 9611, should have snapdragon 7932. It is compatible but not that much fast as snapD...
I order for Ocean Blue.. Amazon sent me Black coloured... that is really bad on Amazon part.. I still kept this piece as I was OK with the colour.
Sound quality is good. With headphones the feature of DolbyAtoms is awesome..
It is a better mobile to use, in this amount..

Been using this phone for a week now, definitely a value for money. The camera is REALLY good and what makes this model stand apart is the BIG BATTERY. I've been using my phone continuously for 2 days now and I still have around 20% charge left.
Not an avid gamer, but it does a good job there as well.
The only drawback I felt was, no earphones/back cover provided in the box.
Overall, definitely a value for money phone with the latest Android version.

Fingerprint reader is Responsive for the quick unlocking of phone,
Quad Cameras embedded in the phone are good and enough for a person to click the daily photographs, selfies and other casual pictures,
Battery life cannot be expected to be better in a phone along with Good Cameras and 6GB RAM

After 60 days:
Great deal in this price range, especially for those who love watching videos and who enjoy music a lot and also who travel a lot.

Camera is good.

Battery: Without a shadow of a doubt, it's a monster. I was concerned about its charging speed; but after using this almost for a week, it doesn't bother me. It takes around 2hr30min.

I'm not a big fan of games. I've been playing "hill climb racing 2" which shows stutter problem almost each time. Not happy about that :(
Needs better optimization.

Review as per me :

Pros:
Camera is descent enough to capture good photos in daylight.
Battery monster for sure
Amoled display

Cons:
Night photos are not so good if you need details and needs lot of improvement.Good for social medias only
Fast Charger is not exactly a fast Charger for 6000mah battery and takes time
Processor is of M30s which does the tasks but not heavy ones and was really disappointing one from Samsung.

Overall I would say it's a 7/10.
Choose according to your needs.

I like the plastic build of this phone. I also like the buttery smooth one UI 2.0 on top of android 10. The battery life is so good, though the phone takes 3 to 3.5hours for charging from 0 to 100%, the battery life is so good and even it lasts for 1.5days on a full charge.
The thing that I dislike in the phone is that the camera performs good in daylight, but when zoomed in, the photos looks pixelated and no sharp image is produced. Not good for lowlight photography. Please samsung provide an update to enhance the clarity of the camera output.

The phone is amazing.....the battery life of this phone is so long lasting....by using  it continuously from last 3-4 days...the results are awesome...the 64mp camera is also too good...the screen response is excellent. And the games runs smoothly on this device. I am giving a 5star rating due to complete package of phone... at this price I am really impressed by this device. I will advise everyone  to buy this budget phone. I liked the phone by the price of phone it's just 14999 and getting a impressive all package phone at Thank you.

Not better than its predecessor, M30s. Slow in face unlock. Hanging from the first day itself. 64 MP camera isn't upto the mark. It's  quality and clarity is equal to the 48 MP camera of M30s. Not happy. Finger print sensor is not responding sometimes. 6000 mAh Battery is only for numbers. Isn't lasting even for one day with moderate usage. Totally disappointed.

I bought this mobile for my father recently. First thing I like about this phone is the camera, it's pretty good.  Love the camera clarity and capability to capture minute details. Coming to the screen, I like the smoothness and big full screen. Screen clarity is on par with the high resolution prominent mobiles. It never gets stuck and really smooth. I'm happy that I picked this phone as a gift for dad. It's his first smartphone and slowly learning using the smart phone, this phone is really smooth and its makes him excited to explore this phone.

I bought this Samsung M31 Ocean Blue  6GB RAM, 64GB Storage last week.
I don't see any issue with the product.
I am very much satisfied with the Finger Print reader and the camera quality.
I would have gone for a 128GB Storage Model but unfortunately it was unavailable during the I ordered..
After using multiple models of mobiles from Samsung and other manufactures, I am really happy with this model.

Initially I was about skeptical on buying a sub 20k phone. . But from the time I started to read about the model and specifications , something was pulling me towards this phone and when I received my order . I knew that it was my best decision that day. . The vibrant screen to the diverse camera options to the best battery life on any smartphone made this piece an awesome choice. Altogether getting it from a brand like Samsung was the best of all. . Enjoying the phone day to day . . . Quiet a Monster M31 is !!!!

Lot of problems with this phone it restarts automatically and it will be hold for 15 minutes with Samsung log on this screen, network goes down suddenly, signals shows full but unable to make the calls or receive the calls

Went to customcare they have updated the software with latest version as per them this will fix all my issues but now same issues plus phone getting heat if I use it for 15 minutes

My suggestion is not to buy this phone

I use the product more as a phone, but the graphics - playing games or watching videos is amazing. its very light weight. I wanted phone with good memory and storage area which i got it. The camera quality is also good. Samsung has given all the features in one phone which are necessary for any person. overall its a very good product by Samsung.

Value for money. Super display and good cameras.Beside of gaming samsung m31 is best for the regular usage and the display is really awesome.I love the display and the size it is compact and easy to hold and use in one hand and it's also feeling like less weight although there is a 6000 mah battery.but with the battery I feel its discharging fast but it's long last for a day and less sar value 0.3 where other smartphones in the price sar values are more than 1.5

A perfect budget smartphone. Trust on samsung. Awesome display, speakers are loud and clear enough.
Nice camera in this budget. Its a battery monster powered by 6000 mah battery. Battery lasts pretty good upto 36 hrs easily. Fingerprint sensors are responsive. Light weight...weight distribution is very nicely done. A 6GB variant at this price range is a nice deal with this package. Camera is awesome having different modes. Awesome pic quality.
As per my usage it's a good deal for me.

6GB+128gb. It's  quiet awesome. Performance is very good. The above uploaded photos are taken in SAMSUNG Galaxy m31. In low light mode m31 is good comparing redmi note 8 pro. Battery backup is more than 24hrs including usage of Online streaming, PUBG game, calls, Facebook and whatsapp. Average battery drains per hour is 2.166% without gameplay. In this segment, this is a very good smartphone. In higher graphics of PUBG , frame is dropping off little but gameplay was very good. I don't like to be finger captured in backside because of Plastic.

This phone is amazing in terms of battery, camera, and processing in managing apps. The phone is quite impressive and the user have easy way to operate, with smoothness. Screen is very much decent and it's color's are so well distributed in pixels. The problem only arises with the camera at night time as it gives photo a roo much HDR, which Is not required as clicking raw photos as a person with photographic skills required the most. Battery is also good enough as it long last for a day and a user want it too.

A very good product from Samsung , I feel this is the best they've launched. Had a very smooth experience regarding the usage of product.
Good Camera, loving the quality.
Good Battery Life, am able to rely on battery for entire day for my usage.
Nice Performance,  but heats up on over usage at the rear near the camera area, if you're not a heavy user the mobile wouldn't heat .
Overall a pleasant  product and a satisfying service.
Hope my review plays a hand of help for those buying it.

Everything is good in this phone... specially display is excellent and also battery backup is too good... yesterday evening at 6:00 my battery was at 100% now this time 9.30 a.m in the morning battery is still 94% with moderate use..no gaming....
Cons- camera is not so good, warm and cloudy pics and selfies.
No screengaurd
No mobile cover
Overall phone is good for those who prefer display, battery and performance over camera....phone is not for camera lover üôèüôè

After using 5 days here are review:
Pros-
1. Nice camera, specifically night mode and super slow mode is superb.
2. Good display
3. Awesome internet speed for 4Vodafone. In previous phone(on nxt) speed was 3-4 mbps, but in this phone speed is about 20mbps.
4. Huge battery that can last 2 days.
5. 128 GB internal memory and 6 GB ram.

Cons:.
1. Screen size is 6.4 but actually image and video runs  on 5.5 inch only and that is the big issue.
2. Charging is slow.
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Pros:
1. Excellent display quality.
2. Decent battery life.
3. User friendly UI with lag free experience.
4. Phone is not too heavy considering the battery capacity.

Cons:
1. Photos from Selfie come out to be soft in indoor lighting condition, Even after disabling the beauty mode the camera tries to smoothen the skin tone, I hope a software update for front facing camera can fix it.
2. Photos from macro camera seems average.
3. Overall I would say this phone's camera needs software optimization.

I've used the phone for a week and the device overall has a good performance.
Face recognition &amp; Fingerprint reader are quick without delay.
For a 6000 mAh battery the phone is light in weight.
Speed, display,  RAM management and storage are good!
The night mode in camera is impressive. EIS is okay.
I've purchased the 128 GB model.
It's a good device overall for a budget of 15k to 17k.

The phone is excellent to use for entertainment and media consumption. The cameras are good, especially the front for video calls. The software experience is smooth and without lag. I have installed a lot of apps and the phone handles multitasking good. I am not a much of a gamer but have installed simple apps like UNO. These games work nice without any lag. But the biggest USP is the battery, which gives almost 8 hrs screen on time while watching videos with headphones.  Overall, satisfied by the experience and nothing to complain about.

This is the one of the best smartphone which is made by samsung with awesome camera quality,
Super amoled screen, superb long lasting battery life and with very fast fingerprint sensor but the only problem in this phone is weight , this phone is quiet heavy but its okay in this price range, over all samsung is offering a good phone in low budget price segment, If someone is looking on this review before buying this phone don't anymore just go and buy it fast, this is the good phone for vlogging and I am using this for vlogging too.

Very good phone in this range. All must go for it rather than redmi, vivo or other phone in same budget. Camera is very nice and hang issues are completely resolved by Samsung. I have been using Samsung from 2015 and it has improved a lot in low budget phones also.  Battery is powerful and durable than all other android phone.

Phone performance are excellent in term of performance
Touch works superbly
Overall phone is excellent
Some things that can be improved-
Front cameras, I would say 6/10 not uptown the standard of 32 MP
Rear camera I would say 7/10, not up to the exact standard of 64 MP
Camera compare to vivo oppo and other phones of  same range phone is on lower side
But performance as compare to vivo, oppo and other phone of same range is on upper side
Back touch sensor work good
Face unlock also work good

Really loved this Samsung Galaxy M31.
Camera 5/5.
Battery 5/5.
Design 5/5.
Processor and user interface 5/5.
Display Touch outstanding 5/5.
Really for One + users this is better option.
Boss Samsung is Super Champ.

Received the product on 11th of march 2020. Within 15 days of delivery various functions of the product stopped working..
Like the mic as well as the speaker of the phone got obsolete. And many more problems arises..Due to Lockdown i was unable to contact with Customers Care.
i think that they delivered the Duplicate Product.. Highly recommend not to buy any of the electronic products from Amazon..so that you will Also not have to face the problem as mine..as right i am in a condition that i have wasted Rs 17,000 in the phone...

Very good smartphone in the range of 15000 as I am using since last 2 and a half months.
It is running very smooth. RAM management is very good and display quality is also awesome. The Dark mode and Popup app feature I liked very much.
The dark mode feature applied in all the app while in others mobiles it is not.
Battery charger need to be improved as the mobile has 6000 mAh battery but charger has  to be of more capacity rather than 15 W.
Fingerprint sensor is also good but sometimes not captures fingerprint.

Being an moderate user here are my views on M31 after using it for 7 days
Pro:
1. Great battery life
2. Decent camera quality
3.  No words to explain the display

Cons:
1. Low light camera not good
2. Heats up!! Yes you heard it right ,mobile heats up quickly while gaming

Overall its a good midrange phone, best for day to day use in this segment, if you are gamer then i think you are in wrong place(unless samsung rectifies it by update).

Most importantly delivery is super fast.

I like the smoothness on the phone, it's camera is really good, the zoom allows the picture not to get pixelated even if you zoom in a lot. The fingerprint gesture and the face recognition is quite fast in comparison to other phones. Battery life is good. However,  the phone gets heated up at times and becomes difficult to take a call and placing on the ear when it's heated up. Also, the phone automatically restarts in between, maybe once every 3-4 days. Overall, this is a good phone for this price!

Budget phone. Don't expect too much in camera.
Pros:
1. Budget wise good configuration.
2. Screen refresh rate is good.
3. The feature are too good like dual window, multiple screen.
Cons:
1. Camera is not great. 64 MP photo shots - after binding it has too much noise.
2. Macro camera shot - focus of the object is not proper ,hope there ll be software update.
3. Battery back up - one full charge lasts for only 12hr with normal usage.

Amazing phone with a stellar display, while performance isn't towards the higher side, the phone makes up for it in its beautiful display and huge battery, the best part about the phone is that it doesn't even feel heavy. The camera is okayish, focusing is a tiny bit slow because of that huge 64mp sensor, it's great for the price and can sometimes produce better photos than my mom's S10 plus, because of the higher resolution.

Every thing is quite good .
Charger with only 15 w and Battery is the only concern
As it comes with 6000mah but not behaving like that ..
Its sensors is good .
providing a best graphic experience
Its amoled screen is the best feature of its .
Gaming experience too is good
Somewhere its getting a heating issue .
But in this amount range... allover its one of the best recommendable phone .
One should buy and be a part of samsung family .. u will love it .

It's an absolute Monster...!
I like the sAmoled screen, battery backup and the camera.
I don't compare with the Chinese brands. You can choose M series or A series according to your requirements. The only drawback is the Processor which could have been better.

Samsung is trusted brand over many years. Its worth every penny. You can blindly go for this M31, the king of budget smartphones.

I was thinking to buy Samsung S20 Ultra. One of my friend told me about M31 launch and i checked about the features on internet. I fell in love with M31 and decided to go for it instead of S20 and i am proud to say that my decision was correct. This is a Mega monster for sure. 64 MB camera, 6 Gb RAM, 128 Gb memory and 6000 mAH battery. Everything is same as what you expect from a flagship phone. Camera is awesome, features are superb and no comparison to the battery, it lasts for 2 days for me. Thankyou Samsung for M31 launch.

After a couple of month of use, phone had started freezing and going in hung state for longer duration. It‚Äôs not even restarted or shutting down at all. Never expected such poor performing product from Samsung!.

I got the device fixed and it‚Äôs now working perfectly fine. The service centre staff was supportive and professional. Thanks very much!

The phone has excellent build quality, supurb display and huge battery life. My battery lasts for 2 days of normal to moderate use when fully charged. Phone lacks in fast charging, it is not that fast but it get compensated by big battery life. Rear camera is also good. Front camera is decent. Colour reproduction is very good, thanks to super amoled display. Watching movies and surfing on social media is delight on this device.
Overall the phone is worth the money in mid range price section.

Ultimate mobile with good design  and excellent  features and excellent  battery backup and the main thing is that super amoled display that's far better than redmi note 9 pro and I have mi a2 but that doesn't
have amoled display but finger sensor and software is awesome  but in this m31 sometimes finger print sensor is not working and back cover is plastic that's why sweat comes fastly.  So please keep working to provide perfect glass or metal back body Samsung üòâ

Well overall its an amazing phone.... The best part is its camera and battery. The battery easily lasts a day full if you are heavy user. I watch videos a lot whether on youtibe, amazon, netflix. If your phone is 100 per Even after heavy usage their will be some juice left. Fingerprint sensor is bit of hits and miss. Camera quality is good. Punchy colours whether its outdoor or indoor, the slow mo everything is gud.. performance wise also good.. Didn't experienced any lag in my 2 months of usage

Awesome display for video lovers and battery is excellent I am watching videos full day with full charge second day 45 percent remaining. When coming to camera small noise is identified in night mode. For out door photography is  very  well indoor low light is not up to the samsung mark improvement needed. For gamers also it's working well very minor lags observed. Fingetprint sensor is also good some people wrote finger print sensor slow but my experience is good. Over all performance high end budget phone I love the phone.

It's the best mid ranger phone. It's has everything what a person needs. Big battery which is its wow feature, it helps me to not to charge  a phone for 2 days. Camera has it's top notch quality. The front notch has pleasant design and it is waterproof, as I have tested. Fingerprint reader is very  much fast as compared to other phones. It's  sleek and lightweight  as it's  have 6000 MAH battery but it doesn't feel bulky. I prefer you to buy this without comparing because it's the best monster.

I have always been a loyal customer with Samsung since 2004. I had just started thinking of switching "BRANDS" this time. On my lookout, i came across Samsung Galaxy M31 and did a detailed comparison with other competitive brands &amp; found  Samsung Galaxy M31 to be far more superior than the rest. This was justified with my purchase.  So far no complaints.....
Pro's:  One day delivery, Best Battery life, Rear Camera is excellent, Front Camera is good,  Finger print &amp; Face Unlock has quick response.
Con's: NIL so far

I bought this product last week through Amazon. The camera is of high clarity and overall it is a really good phone. But there is something wrong with the mobile's microphone. During a call I end up sounding muffled or far off to the person on the other end even if I am using an earphone. It is really turning out to be a major issue due to the high strain with which I have to speak. I am thinking about returning back the product. Plus the battery too is running out a bit fast. Other than that the product is great and handy.

Ordered my new Galaxy M31 last week. The first impression was good.  Build quality  looks premium, though metallic body would have been great. Quite fast to operate. Excellent  bright display. Camera clicks good quality photos. Macro cam is gives moderate  quality  clicks. Battery lasts longer and recharge doesnt take unusually  long time.
Overall happy with my choice. At this price point,  it is one of the best device  available in market.

Best phone in this price,
I read all negative reviews,
But when I use m31 from 1week ,iI found conclusion that,this phone is far ahead of Chinese brand,it looks premium, camera is best,
Some functions only me has isDARK MODE,SUPER SLOW MOTION PICTURE &amp;AUDIO,THE S AMLOID EXPERIENCE IS ROCKING.
And lastly those who have negative reviews or some problems for m31 ,is only matter of users understanding because this phone have much advance features in camera and os &amp;it takes atleast 1week to full understand &amp; remember all this

Things which make this device a good pick:
1)Amoled display makes the user experience really smooth.
2)camera quality in outdoors is amazing.
3)body design is nicely crafted,people asked me which phone is this often.
4)the user interface is nicely designed so there is no confusion and mismanagement.
Few cons:
1)Camera can dissapoint sometimes in low light.
2)battery drains faster but 6000mah manages it well.
3)charging upto 70% is fast then it takes time

Worst product and worst company. I bought this mobile on March 11th 2020. after a month suddenly it displayed "Accidental touch protection" alert and since then touch stopped responding. Now i'm not even able to open mobile. it is just a dummy piece now. when contacted samsung support, they didnt even help on this. During these tough times how does this company expects us to communicate without mobile.

Please stop manufacturing these kind of cheap mobiles.

I am reviewing this after using it for a week.

The fingerprint sensor is good camera quality is excellent. Rear camera in 64 mp clicks amazing quality pictures in bright sunlight one cannot use flash or zoom feature in this mode.  Front camera is really good. The pic attached is of 64 mp sunlight capture.Battery life is satisfactory.

The phone doesn't have any safety feature like s secure or security folder no Knox features and even no gallery syn with ur samsung cloud .

The features are all fine. But if you use it continuously for 20 minutes, it will get heated to an unbearable extent.

I checked if there is any solution for this. The solution is to reduce brightness and use fewer number of apps.

But one buys a smartphone to use the apps!

Samsung M31 is a value for money phone, I have 6/128 varient, performance is great no hangging issues. I play lot of games, watch youtube. I have been using this device for last 2.5 months, I am totally satisfied, Superb screen, suberb battery life. It is slightly heavy but for 6000mah battery its just fine. Camera is decent. This is best phone at this price point. Only one drawback that I felt Samsung should've provided a 22-25 watt fast charger instead of 15 watt as it takes around 2 hours 20 mins to get fully charged.

Love the battery life. That was my priority and I glad to say in terms of battery the product won my heart. When it comes to camera I am very disappointed as the camera performance is mediocre. The phone does not allow you to save raw files. I never faced overheating issues. Am using this for more than two month. It's a good buy for anyone who wish to gift it to their parents. The screen is equally good.

Finger print sensor is awesome, the quick way it unlock the phone is very satisfying.
Camara quality is way beyond expected the color of image &amp; contrast rate is nice. Options provided in pro mode is very nice &amp; useful, selfi Camara also playing very nice role. It is also quick in unlocking phone by face recognition.
Battery life is fo far good, I was expected battery will  comes around 2 days but getting around 1.5 can't say it is bad. Optimizing the apps may give more efficiency.

good phone in this Price rang.. camera captures good photos at day and night in boths lights.
design is impressive.
performance is very good. even supporting Ultra HD graphics games. like Pubg..
not. heating while using too much.
battry is awesome.
and some review was that 15 watt charger is taking too much time to charge full battry of this phone.

but seriously i feel that charging speed is fast and too good.
go for it if you want all rounder phone.

Camera is not good in quality  and sometime glitch in keyboard or in tapping on flash light or night mode button while scrolling  AND THE BIG ISSUES  is that battery take long time to charge .overall  it is worthy according to price . Picture quality  is also bad getting  blur after take a shot while zooming  in . Back surface is very slippy . Finger print  sensor is less working . I suggest to buy POCO X2 in this price .

This is the worst Samsung phone I ever had. I have been always a Samsung user. But this time this model of phone is very worst.
- The phone hangs each and every time,specially while typing...
- 1st it hangs and then it automatically get restart. Or sometimes it get restart without doing anything.

I am often travelling because of which i needed a phone with great battery backup so after searching for a week, i finally found Samsung M31 with 6000mah battery and i gotta say, it hasn't disappointed me at all. sometimes i forget to charge my phone and leave with 30 - 40% but still it doesn't stop me from playing games or stream music and movies.. Moreover, the camera is great too and it really liked the super slow motion feature..Overall.. It's a great phone to buy and worth every penny

There is nothing to dislike this monster.

Display/Screen is illustrious.
Cameras are splendid.
Battery backup is awesome.
Fingerprint Sensors is very fast to sense n unlock.
Processor is very fast.
Smooth performance.
Too much of storage.
Fast charging is very good.
Price is unbelievable. So many features in so less price by the Korean beast is unimaginable.

What else you want in this price range?
Just grab the MegaMonster.

Prons:
1. Display much better than MI phones.
2. Camera is awesome (Both Rear and Front).
3. Light Weight
4. Much Better than MI Note 8 Pro in every field

Cons:
1. Charger is only 15W. It takes 2-3 hour to fully charge the phone.
2. Charging Cable is very short.
3. Back Panel gives plastic feel. I feel Mi note 8 phone beat samsung in  this section.
4. Some Heating issue i also feel while phone is in charging mode.

Camera quality is too poor.64 MP camera doesn't allow u taking pic with Flash light if there is dark in the room at night.pic with 64mp camrra were too bad than M30s(48 mp was better).i bought M31 for its 64mp camera.but It disappointed me much.Pixels scattered soon while zooming.No quality in pics.i had read negative reviews here about its camera, inspite bought,now repenting.Would not give even one star if available.Never recommended.....

Best phone ever from Samsung in this price range, Samsung has shown that their cameras are the best at any price range, a very great job with the battery, a reasonable processor for a phone priced at this range and with their awesome sAMOLED screen it's reallly a monster #megamonster
The best part is 64mp beast camera for high quality pictures and 4k videos and also a decent night mode with a 6000mah mega battery what else do you need in a phone
#smoothaf with their AMOLED screen with the latest  android 10

Samsung outdid themself, I have to say it's one of the best value smartphone ever from samsung. The 6000 mah battery makes the battery life last for 2 days before charging and having a dedicated fingerprint reader is faster and better than the on screen one in this price range, and the quad camera setup with 64 mp main sensor gives u the best camera quality in a smartphone of its price range along with samsung super amoled display the best in class display. All in all the best value for money smartphone from samsung.

Dream like transition while upgrading a J8 to M31. Samsung swipe ensured transfer of all data seamlessly. Camera quality is mindblowing. It can inherently create magic with every shot. Display and functionality is superlative.. In a nutshell worth every penny

When i got the phone the battery was 0% and i had to charged it before first use. I don't know it is normal or not.also it has some heating issues and camera quality is not upto the mark.what i most like about the phone is display quality and i don't think any other phone at this price range would have such a display.

User interface is awesome, nice display, battery lasts for more than 24 hours with normal use with wifi and data on. I ordered it on 5th march and the phone was delivered on 8th march. Till now it's running very smoothly, camera quality is best in this prise segment.

After using more than 3 months i recommend this phone to others also and ordered one more unit. In this price segment this is the best phone. But this time price hike is the disappointing thing...

BESTTTTTT!!! PHONE EVER UNDER 16,000.
Battery Life is 6000 mAH.
CHARGING TIME ONLY 150-160 minutes with 15wt fast charger
Battery life is up to 7 days in super power saving mode and 23 hours in playing PUBG mobile
Samsung m31's 64mp camera is better than any other 64mp camera selfie camera is 32 mp it is also superb it also has 123¬∞ wide angle shot and macro shot low light and night shot also.
RAM is 6gb is better for playing PUBG mobile

A very good mid range smartphone from Samsung targeting the multimedia consuming section of user. Its super AMOLED screen adds to its combination powered by a 6000mah battery that keeps running the phone for a longer time . Moreover 64 Megapixel quad camera helps people to try out their photography skills perfectly. It's exynos 9611 processor gives a decent gaming performance including PubG which you can play at HD Ultra configuration too.

I bought it on the first day of the sale itself. Have been using it for one week.  Camera quality's excellent , a notch above competition. Same goes about tge display as well. SAmoled screen's very vivid and crystal clear, especially with fhd videos. Battery can easily push 30-36 hrs even if u use it extensively. Not a gamer. So cant review about processer.
However the only one issue i noticed is the mobile data/ wifi may become unresponsive/ idle. We will have to turn off wifi/ toggle flight mode to solve it.

I am writing this review after 3 months of extensively using my Galaxy M31.
It's super fast processor does multitasking like a charm.
Screen is awesome and each and every detailing looks lively.
I am not very impressed with the camera but certainly this is the best in this price range.
It Dolby Atmos feature makes music experience just like a movie theater or an expensive music systems.
I am overall extremely satisfied with my purchase.

It's a real mega monster specially  in  this  price  range. I liked m31 very much because of its 64 mp quad camera 4k video recording ,the super amoled  FHD+infinity  u display with a big screen size of 6.4 inch also the fast charging  and long lasting  6000mAh battery ,and a good processor and a very quick working  face lock and fingerprint sensor, it is a product which is worth for the amount taken

Best Thing--Battery,Display,One Ui, Battery optimization while gaming,file transferring speed,Dolby Atmos Access.
Better things--Fingerprint reader,face unlock, processor speed,Camera quality,video recording,GPU,Charger.
Bad things--Video Stabilization while recording in any resolution,gives much punchy colours in photos.

At last I want to say it's a good mobile via Samsung BUT I want to know why Samsung is not giving Knox security and it's best ear buds earphones.

My review after 1 week of use :

Heating issues - while charging,  on video calls, during video recording,  while doing still photography in HDR mode.

Back sensors - not working properly, you have to try multiple times.

Camera - 3.5/5 camera is okay but not as per claim of 64mgpxl.

Wifi issue- it's not able to connect to some wifi networks however at the same time other phones are able to connect to the same wifi.

Battery- with full charging it is lasting for 1 day with normal use.

Just a basic phone.  If you have a fix budget below 15k, u may go for it.  Samsung has tried to make fool the customers with the pre launch specifications about this model. I never prefer Chinese phones, but after seeing this Samsung phone, I can surely say Oppo Vivo RealMe and RedMe are much more better than this. Cameras are like dummy tiny glasses. All other specifications are only in written. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Finger reader is good but it is same as mobile phone's  surface it needs some space inside.

Camera quality is good as i dnt like the photo capture sound i dnt find its disable option if there is not in phone so it should be in phone.

Battery is good

After all mobile charger wire is very small in box its not enough

And there is no mobile cover with the phone that is very important due to new series covers are not available in market and there 2 things are also important

After using this phone over 3months you can totally relly on it's battery back up. Rear camera is best at this price segment but front camera didn't deserve much appreciation. Samsung has to work on it's software functions to improve the speed and multi tasking accessibility which 6GB RAM can handle easily. Heating issues can be faced in daily routine but one of the greatest thing is phone didn't feel much heavy and it's weight balance is awesome.
Overall you can't deny to buy this one at this price point.

Very good phone. But the screen glass is very delicate. I was placing the mobile in my shelf and the screen glass broke due to the slight touch of the screen to the shelf wall. Would like to repeat it was slight touch and the glass broke. There are 2 huge cracks on the screen, crossing each other at the mid spot of the screen, probably a very delicate spot of the screen. This is definitely not expected out of a mobile which has gorilla glass. Not acceptable and not satisfied with the quality of the screen glass.

Have been using this mobile over 14 days. Its one of the best phones i have used so far. Battery, camera, superamoled display are main features the phone is offering, for me its sar value and its weight management add to it. It has its own limitation in night camera and heavy gaming, i dont mind them as its offering way more than many others in this price range.
Fully satisfied with this product and also has to appreciate fast delivery from amazon team.

When I first turned on the phone saw a screen with some kind of error details which I couldn‚Äôt understand. Not sure if this phone delivered to me is having any faults. After few tries it got powered on. So waiting for few more days to find out if there are any problems. It may be one of case.

Money:
Economical, right price for the right phone.
No better deal available in the same price.

Battery :
Phone is really great in this case. With 15W charging option and 6000mAh battery it gives you freedom to use it to full extent for whole day, that too without worrying for the battery percentage.

Camera :
Camera quality is as good as expected.

Overall Experience :
It is a good combination with all the features and a good product in affordable price.

Best value for money in this mid range segment..
1. Plus point is Super Amoled display with the vibrant and eye-catching colors...For display can't beat any other brands.
2. 64mp quad camera's quality is truly awesome.. it captures very nice photos.
3. Mega monster 6000 Battery is one more plus point, although weight distribution is great...It will give you near about 2 days long battery backup.
4. Fingerprint sensor is also fast.
Overall it is super mega monster &amp; king of all brands

The phone delivered to me is a faulty piece. It has no sound. number of users has reported the same issue in Samsung community. Because of lockdown i was not able to return it to Amazon and now Smasung service centers are also closed.
I want to request Amazon to increase the retun Window because of lockdown.

Samsung guys are also not supporting.I have wasted my money.  Please please don't buy this phone.

Overall a good phone...

Though the processor could have been better, but considering rest of the features offered I would say it's fine...

It's definitely not a gaming centric phone, you can play games, but it might stutter at max settings like in PUBG.

You get good cameras (macro is mostly useless to me),
a great battery (lasts me a whole day on medium-heavy use) and
a good display...
I would say it is mostly focused towards those who watch a lot of videos...

This phone is excellent.
Pros:
1. Does not feel heavy for the battery size.
2. Super display. Media consumption is a great experience on it.
3. Good camera: pics come out really good.
4. Battery lasts 2 day

Cons:
Back panel could have been textured to provide some grip but that can be tided over by adding a case as most smartphone users do regardless of the make and model.

Amazing phone in budget line. Getting 2.5days on hard use. Night shot getting marvelous output of 1.8 aperture lens. 64MP quad Cam on test getting output quality more than expected.

Overall i will give 5 star compare to A Series.
Con: Macro 2.2 shots

At first look and use:
- Phone looks sleek, ocean blue colour looks amazing
- big screen and very nice clarity as well as brighteness
- Huge battery for longer usage but at 15W charging, it takes time to charge to full
- smooth user interface
- Great camera for a budget phone, almost similar to expensive phones camera
-And ofcourse at 16k you get 128Gb of storage which is amazing!!!!

-Thank u amazon for a great deal at 16K and a 24 hour delivery

I had Xiaomi phone before this and it was much better than this. The sound quality is not that good, screen quality is average and Samsung keyboard hangs sometimes. Charging is really slow even though it displays fast charging. Also it is not allowing to uninstall even some third party apps like Netflix, facebook. I went on to Samsung from Mi just because of anti chinese sentiment, but the phone is not worth it.

The worst charging ever this phone has. I sometime feel I can press my clothes with the heat from this . Damn it's so slippery you will feel it's possed sometimes .

Fingerprint scanner works 9 out of 10 times
Camera quality is absolutely amazing the best 64 MP
It comes with Samsung's one UI
A SAMOLED 6.4 inch display

Cons
Face recognition works a little slow and 7 out of 10 times
Sound quality of speakers is awesome but it could have been more clear and loud

I ordered the phone right on the day it got launched, and have been heavily using it. Most of my office work including emails, calls, webinars is getting done through this amazing smartphone during this home stay phase, &amp; the best part is that I just need to charge it once in 2 days! Both the front and rear cameras take phenomenal photos in presence of adequate light. Not very suitable for low light photography.
In short, this budget phone is an excellent value for money.

The phone is an absolute deal for those searching best value for money under the 20k bracket. I got the 128gb variant and it came real early than the expected delivery date. The phone looke amazing, display is good, sound is good, little issues with fingerprint reader. Great camera i must say is more than great and battery is even better - takes time to charge fully but once charged you need to forget about your battery for lets say 40 hours or 2 days, overall samsumg has given a great value for money.

Intially phone was working good but after normal use of 2 months, it started taking too long in charging, and charging speed after 75% becomes very less.
I can say time taken in charging after 75% is twice of time taken upto initial 75%.
Samsung customer care suggested charge in different modes, change charger, charging chord etc.
I did everything but still issue is same. At last just waiting to visit samsung service center once situation becomes normal and government lifts restrictions.

This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand. I have brought after the 2 months after the launch. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.
When it comes to camera it has 64 mp main camera that's really good and macro camera is good enough to capture the minute details.
It's come up with Exynos 9611 processor which is decent performance

This is a complete package from Samsung. Excellent Camera, Great Battery life, and tons of various features.

Finger print sensor is very sensative. Different camera modes allows you to take excellent quality photos with different modes. However, I am most impressed by it's battery life. It was good to see type C port with the phone.

This is overall a complete package and I have recommended this phone to all my friends. They all are having a very good experience using it as well.

Let me first begin with the quality of product against the price AMAZING! The Battery Life- OH MY GOD! WOW and Beautiful Pictures. Its unfortunate I can not immediately go on a vacation to use my phone camera features due to this Lockdown. But if you have a budget of up to 20k and you need good battery life and amazing touch and camera features,  JUST GO FOR THIS.. It probably beats the A Series phones of Samsung.. Well done and Thank You Samsung üôÇ

1st day review -
1) Most things like screen, battery, camera looks good.

2) Volume rockers are placed at somewhat odd location. Its not easy to reach.

3) Sim tray looks so cheap and fragile. It can break  easily if not handled with care.

Will update on further usage.

I am using Samsung from last 10 years but I have facing multiple issues with M31 phone from the first day of purchasing. I will never recommend Samsung phone to anyone.

1. The phone sometimes restarts itself and sometimes gets stuck on Samsung itself for about 1 hour.
2. To much phone heating issue in normal uses.
3. To much phone hanging issue even some time phone is stuck for 1 to 2 hours.
4. I have raised the issue with Samsung but not get any solution from Samsung Team.

Pros:
Battery life is good.
Light weight.
Looks like a pro with the multiple cameras on its back.
Thin compared to other mobiles of it size, although gives better battery life.

Cons:
Camera quality is not at all like a 64 mega pixel cam.
Face id takes more time for recognition.
Under low light, face id does‚Äônt work at all.
Heating occurs when in extreme use.

Yesterday I got the software updation notification. I also allowed to update the same, to morning it was updated. When I allowed to install, it has been hanged and showing error that "downloading do not turn off target". I am using as a official mobile but now at this lockdown situation I can't access any of my data, payment details, contacts etc. Then what is the user of buying this mobile I don't know. Very very pathetic situation due to the mobile problem.

I have been using this phone now for two weeks. Iam delighted to acknowledge that for what amount I spent I bought a pretty nice phone. Battery life is great, finger print scanner works  fast, touchscreen is also very smooth.
I can click colorful photos with a wide angle feature also.
One thing I would suggest is if the company could out an option for the customer that if want the protection cover also for the phone otherwise customer has to find it separately.

There are multiple reason for choosing this mobile.
1. Not by a Chinese company. (South Korean company) with a manufacturing plant in India.
2. A name which we can trust. Known for ages.
3. Now on A31, using it for a week. Excellent battery backup.
4. Camera picture quality is exceptional.
5. I like the samsung max feature.
6. Not filled with unwanted softwares.
7. I am moving from Apple iPhone 7 to samsung. It gives a good experience.

Camera quality is awesome excellent &amp; battery life also good but I didn't like keyboard option which can't support other languages as expected &amp; we need to download third-party app!!fingerprint is good but if it's placed on display screen instead of back side then it would be better but not a big issue

Working very nice... looks very good. It's sensor is so good that it feels like butter touch. The price is worth purchasing.. Samsung is giving you a lot in this price like Android 10, Gorilla glass, 6000 mAh Li-ion battery, crystal clear dolby sound , battery back up is very good, Ocean Blue looks attractive, but its C -type charging cable should have been a little longer in size. So, I  recommend yo buy it because Samsung is giving much more than the other products available at the se price in market.

Before buying my new smartphone, I came across many products like Mi redmi note 8 pro. But It doesn't come amoled display and huge battery life. Apart from this, I would like to appreciate the performance of mobile during game time. Also, One UI 2 which is currently Samsung's latest UI version is also have best gestures and looks and it's easy to navigate through the apps. Last but not least, Camera including rear and front are just awesome with brilliant night photos and for the portrait ones.

I get it delivered through STPL Exclusive Online dealer. This dealer delivered me defective piece. Phone battery was dead and it never powered on. It remained switched off and as I tried to charge it there is no charging indicator and it has not changed as I changed it appropriately for half an hour. I have ordered a replacement and hoping this time I will get a right product. I hope....

This product has very good performance. It has highest battery life which is 6000 mah. Fingerprint reader is also very effective and also the camera recognizes the face in a fraction of seconds. This is a fantastic camera mobile too with 64 MP quad camera. It also has selfie camera with 32 MP. The design looks very slim and beautiful. However, the keypad strucks sometimes when it is overused. It is the mobile with all the features i.e., camera(64 MP), battery life(6000 mah), sleek and stylish.

Good phone , could have been better. At price is little higher compared to poco. Just bought this bcz of amoled display.. not expecting wonders with this phone as it has processor that cant compete with sd series. Buy it for ladies not for yourself. Game lovers stay away. Buy poco instead much better.

Not worth it, dont buy it. I purchase it few days back only hardly 15 days happens by looking at its battery size &amp; specification. Battery life is really good, no doubt on it but i am facing the issue which i never thought. Its hangs, with even 6 gb ram still the device hang automatically &amp; that too for 5-10 min &amp; i am unable to do in that situation as battery is non removable in nowdays devices. I really wants to replace it but already 10 days pass so company will not take it back also. Think once while buying this product.

Phone has stuck at Downloading after installing the April 2020 update. I wouldn't have put this review but suffering this in the time of COVID-19 lockdown I wont be able to trust samsung again in my future purchases. They should test their updates before releasing them.

Crisp display, long battery life, awesome camera are amongst the pros of this product. Touchscreen works so smoothly....
However, a bit faster fingerprint sensor or on screen fingerprint sensor may take this product to the next level.
I don't have any lagging or hanging issues till now, works very fine with me. But incorporation of much modern processor is further appreciable.

It is a monster indeed. The display is the best in the market under 20k. It is far better than the Chinese brands(The image quality of Chinese brands is just the worst when compared to this M31 image quality). The battery life is awesome. Its super slow-motion feature is really amazing. Totally worth every single penny.
Overall reviews
Camera 5/5
Performances 4/5
Display 5/5
Battery 5/5
Phone look 4/5
Sound 4.5/5
Overall the best phone in this segment.

Samsung at it's best with top (mega monster) features..
Camera quality is just mind blowing with superb options ..
The AMOLED display with resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels and 403 ppi pixel density is just awesome..
 6Gb/128Gb - monster ram and space ..
Dont see the negative reviews just go for it ..
Best and worth mobile ..
RIP Redmi Realme ..
Thanks to AMAZON for the quick delivery...(bcz eventhough CORONA issues are going around they did their job clean )

1. Truely a mega monster in terms of battery backup , camera quality ( in terms of zooming it provides ) , samoled display.
2. Make sure that the product you get is free from defects . Proximity sensor of my m31 doesn't work perfectly .
3. Charging takes a lot of time (2.5 hrs for 0 to 100% ) as charger is of 15 w power.
4. I faced hanging problem which is faced by many others with other samsung smartphones.
Personally am not very happy with product due to hanging issue.

This phone is value for money. You cannot ask for a better phone than this in this price range.
Camera is good with all the effects of an high end phone. No lagging at all.
Works fluently.
I have been using it for the last 3 days without charging it, still I have 28 percent battery.
Sleek phone, easy to use, updated android version.
You cannot ask for a phone better than this in this or a slight above price range as well.
Well done Samsung..  a must have phone.

Good looking mobile. Nice camera but disappointed in night vision and natural colors. Sharpness is low. Battery backup according to 6000mah is average in normal usage( 3-4calling &amp; 1-2hr internet maximum 36hr.. Fast charger is taking  more than 100mins for 20 to 100 .
Call on speaker not working properly.
Display quality is very good. Selfie camera is good. Overall in this budget phone is good but not very good

Best phone in this price level.  Overall performances are very good except camera.  Camera is far better than M30&amp;M30S but could be a little more better.  You can't use flash in 65MP and UHD resolution doesn't support video features. Apart from these..camera is fine.  Nice shots can be made easily with this one. Battery is the best part of the phone. No lag noticed in 4 days of use.  Sometimes heats up a little.. but it's negligible heating.

Fingerprint reader is very good within just a second u can unlock the screen,as coming to the battery it really good just after charging a full of 100 percent it can last for a very long time.
When coming to the camera it is just superb u can capture so much of detail using the awesome quad camera,with 64,8,5,5 megapixel cameras u can get an awesome clarity pictures .
The night mode is working just awsome.This mobile really pays off its worth.All around performer in every aspect.

Sleek design . It has got an excellent battery backup runs throughout the day.camera is just fabulous it got a clear image n pixels. Both rear and selfie camera comes with flash which is an added advantage.  Touch sensitivity is perfect. Processor is fast but could have been better compared to other models like one plus. I ordered it on the same day it was launched.  I would strongly recommend this phone to others. Overall it is a perfect model at nominal price.

Bought new Samsung M31 after searching for good 3 months for a good camera phone...After using it for  couple of days I can tell you that It was worth waiting..This phone has an amazing camera with separate  macro n  telescopic lens among others. Pics clicked by this phone can give  photos of any flagship phone run for money. I can say with tons of other features it is the camera that stands out. This is the best camera phone under 15000/

Have been using this device for the past two months. The main highlight is the battery life, it lasts more than one day even with very heavy usage. The camera is great in outdoor lighting but in indoor lighting the photos are just average. While in low light the photos are very disappointing. Finger print sensor is fast and detects most of the time. Also, the Super Amoled display is fantastic, the colours look great. For the price point, this is a great phone.

The Galaxy M31 is well made phone with good display. I'm impressed with the performance, the software experience and especially the terrific battery life. The 64MP camera also takes good quality pictures. The impressive 64MP camera on the back is also outnumbered by its lackluster siblings, whether it's the soft and mediocre ultra-wide lens or the largely useless macro and depth cameras would. I recommend it as one of the options to consider when purchasing a phone in this price range.

I have purchased this phone for battery back up requirement and camera. I am fully satisfied with my choice. The battery back up is very good. I can use my phone for about 1-2 hours only after getting it charged for 5-10 minutes if the battery is fully discharged. Most interesting thing I got to know after purchasing of this phone, the pic editing options of this phone. A normal click pic can be converted in to a professional click pic. Screen is very smooth.

There is nothing one can dislike in this smartphone, it's more than what it is priced at. This is the first time when companies like Samsung are giving so much feature in affordable price, fully satisfied. Truly a monster phone.

Camera, battery, display, screentime everything is super. I was in confusion between redmi note 9 pro and samsung m31, but I made right choice. After samsung a30 now m31, fully satisfied with samsung.

I was purchased this mobile on first day of sale on Amazon &amp; write review after use of 3 months.
1) Mobile charging is too slow. For 10% to 95% charging required more than 4 hours.

2) Mobile is automatically switched off, during call also. It will take minimum 8-10 min for restart.

3) Camera quality is also not satisfied.

4) Body cover made by plastic.

Not expected this type of quality from a company like SAMSUNG

I shifted from a Moto G6 ...fingerprint sensor at back  wasn't a good transition for me ...though the sensor is quite good.

Camera ...wilh all those 4 cameras...pics still come bit soft . Ex. Skin texture gets smoothened .

Battery ....I don't play games ..and neither do I watch movies . Just regular social media apps and WhatsApp . Even my calls are very less. Still the bulky battery just lasts bit more than a day. And it takes bit long to fast charge ...which feels as if it's not fast charging.

Phone is getting heated. Network delay is there. It's taking a very long time for a call to get connected. Once a call is connected there is nearly a delay of 5 seconds in hearing the opposite parties voice. People are complaining that my voice is continuously breaking when I am speaking from this phone and the opposite parties voice is also continuously breaking and I couldn't hear them properly. Apart from this the other features of this phone and it's appearance are all very good.

Camera quality is too good for the price you pay. Enough storage space for many apps and games. Netflix and Prime is available in HD. Fingerprint reader is very fast. Battery life lasts for 1 day and next day half . Fast charger is there but it is better for overnight charging. Colour options are less but it is a great phone for price quality. The screen resolution is very good and night mode is there. Also blue light filter is also there which is very good.

It is one of the best camera phone in this price range from Samsung with a monster batter and a great AMOLED screen. I'm using this phone from last 3 months now and i didn't face any problem yet. You can through any game on medium to high graphic setting with good frame rate without any problem and yes it feel premium in hands and it's not that heavy either even with 6000mah battery but 15W charger took time to fully charge your phone.

The phone's pretty good ...battery backup is epic
And the display is really good compared to the other phones in the same price range
And I exchanged my vivo v9 which I bought it for 25k
But I got this phone for 15999 which very cheap and has a lot of cool features which my old phone didn't have
And battery lasts for nearly two days which is actually really good
I love the performance
And the fingerprint scanner
 is also quite good

1) The battery is massive, for my use it easily lasts for 2 days.
2)  The camera quality is nice. Especially while using the 64mp sensor.
3) display is gorgeous.
4) the speakers great. Dolby atmos works great with headphones

Over all a real deal breaker.

Using it from last 3 months, found no issue yet.
Best thing is the main USB of the phone, its 64 MP quad camera, shoots amazing photos and video. Also the front camera is very good.
Have smooth performance while playing games like PUBG. Also have 6000 mAh battery  so you can play games, movies etc. for a long time. So overall it's a very good phone in this price range than other brands. Also no unnecessary ads issues with other brands, have very clean and nice UI without any unnecessary preinstalled apps.

Screen is awesome.. charger is of 15 watt only.. gives a warranty of 1 year.. screen guard or back cover ain't free.. there are Many inbuilt apps .. blue color suits awesome with the sleek design.. phone runs for a day or more.. 2nd sikal slot is not hybrid, so u can add an sd card along with it along with 2 nano sim cards. Android 10 is awesome. 6 GB RAM with such a processor makes it good gaming too (not awesome though). Camera is average. Plus its samsung, so u can have a trust.

9. Curved edges give better handling.

SAMSUNG Galaxy M31 is an amazing smartphone with all the features you would ask for..
The battery is too good and works for longer time along with fast charging option
The looks of this phone is very good and stylish
I am impressed with camera both rear and front...amazing quality.
The overall performance is very good and I suggest you should go for the 6 GB Ram and 128 GB storage
This phone offers value for money and the comfort you are looking for... :-)

Front camera with 32MP is at it's best. Even if you zoom the photo taken by front am, to the fullest, pixels are pretty clear, no blur or image damge.
It's too much value for Money. Must buy if you want have a really good ph at this budget üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëåüèª

Liked this mobile a lot. I had doubts after reading some negative reviews here... but went a head and booked one.
After using for 4 days iam in love with this mobile. Everything is positive-battery,camera both front &amp; rear-pictures are very good , video quality is excellent in daylight &amp; decent in low light,touch response,built quality .  Finish is so good that it can slip from hand so use back cover. Overall worth buying. Not sure for gamers though.

Macro shot - look like a wallpaper- best shots
64 mp camera - you see a small details - best
Ultra wide angle - is too good comparison with other phones.
Performance and specially UI is perfect,
When u play pubg, it is smooth  experience  and
Battery is mega moster-this is real
And last one is super amoled display of Samsung - to watch real colur of any video

This is the best phone that you can ever ask for if your budget is under 16k. sAMOLED display, 6000 mah battery, 64 MP rear cam, 32MP front cam and the 6gb ram - 128gb rom combo are the deal breakers. Go for it blindly. I have used phones of redmi(xiaomi) &amp; realme previously. I can definitely vouch for the Samsung brand for all the above mentioned features. Thank you Samsung for such a marvel.

Ehat can i say.... its really awesome in this segment.... ultimate battery life, Display chanceless.... Camera quality also good.... But if you want to play high graphics Gaming some lag is observed.... most important SAR value is very low.... Huge diplay.... easy to handle.... I'm really happy to buy this....

Design - 3.5/5
Camera - 4.0/5
Processor- 4.5/5
Display- 5/5
Features- 4.5/5

Shared my own opinion..... you can buy without douby

Mobile touch display is not working once u lock the phone(not at all sensing our finger touch) it's really hard to unlock again and unlocking only after so many tries and it ll unlock  if there is a luck . Face unlock is  also poor. Mobile outlook is really good but disappointed with its performance. So today I requested for return and the process is initiated with amazon.  Thank u amazon for immediate response

Battery life is perfect when compared to the other smartphones .The best part of this mobile is the style of samsung through its glossy back surface ...SAMOLED Display which makes the touch feel very much appreciable and swift ....Camera is way beyond to be described wide angle with 64megapixel makes the picture look qualified with natural original look of the picture ...For all to say a most adaorable and lovable phone of the time within the budget and greater performance ...

Its amazing  phone from Samsung.
 battery life is great. On one full charge  it can give you 1.5 day of battery life . Its fingerprint reader is on its  doun side .you have to put your  finger  multiple times  to unlock it .
Display  is it's very strong  point . Very  bright  colors.
Camera quality is good  . Not that great  what I expected  but it's ok for this price  reng. Over all this phone is full package in  mid range  smartphones.

From galaxy grand-2 to M31, yet another benchmarked phone from Samsung. Bought it on 6th march. Amazing looks, features, fast processing of apps, camera and add-on features are simply superb splly slomotion captures, colours are so natural. And of course lastly the main reason to but this phone the #battery, the mammoth 6000mAh powerhouse is sufficient to spend up the day (even more) without any interruption for any working professional.. enjoy#befikar

Hardware wise nothing to complain about everything is great but can use some software touches like camera i think the software need an upgrade the pictures taken get soften too much and the details get compromised, the fingerprint reader is fast the Samoled looks great!. Stock android would have been great had to uninstall a lot of unnecessary applications other UI is great and oh the battery life this baby could last ages long battery life one full charge and this will last all day even with heavy usages

2 weeks of me using it. I would recommend this phone to anyone. I am using this as an office phone. As sales, my phone is unstoppably ringinflg adding with COVID.

Still battery lasts for 1.5 days which is a real boon.

Display and Performance is good.

Product built quality is very poor.
- Volume button is loose and goes inside without pressing
- camera placement is inclined. One end it projects high and other end it goes into body
- Fingerprint print sensor is also inclined. One end it goes deep into body and other end it comes up. So while placing the finger it doesn't feel good.

M31 is a value for money smartphone but could have been better in finger print reader &amp; fast charging. Finger print reader is not as good as in other phones and to charg 0-100% it need atlist 2 Hours  . The display is good with good colours balck. Main camera and selfiy camera is also doing a good work But the macro and Telephoto lenses is not good as they say it on papers.. if you are looking a good display phone go for this .

Three things which mattered, display, battery and interface ; all are absolutely perfectly balanced. At the price point its amazing. You can continue to use the beautiful display for long duration without the need to worry about the battery charge. The Samsung UI is as usual updated and getting better. The camera is OK; need to explore more, however initial assessment is above average but no comparisons to the likes of S8 / S9.

I waited for the phone around 1 month and I don't regret it at all.
Sometimes gets slower,
Fewer times got hanged(personal experiences only)
Night camera is efficient enough not bad altogether.
Amazing interface and display,
Sound quality is good and touch is smooth.
Just a bit expensive than it should be
Overall best phone of Samsung under 18000.
"Keep updating the software Samsung".
You'll love the photography with the phone.

Over all phone is excellent but the major problem i m facing is the sound problem after some time while using the phone its sound get low and you can‚Äôt increase it by pressing volume button one has to go to setting and some inbuilt app is their you have to force stop every time. Big shit for it every time man

The battery life is out of this world,one feels as its battery never runs out.
Amoled display stands out with the crisp images.These two features makes this phone binge watchers dream.The processor is exynos9611 which might be a minor con for hardcore gamers but it did great while I played PES. The camera is really great too,it clicked amazing pictures outside and the front camera also boasts of great quality.
Overall,this is the best phone in this price range.

I have used samsung galaxy m31 for a week now and it is one of the best phones I have used. For the price, the number of features are never ending. Very user friendly and huge battery.  I barely finish 50% of my battery in a day after a full day on streaming and video calls. The only issue is the face recognition which is a bit sluggish and sometimes doesn't read the face

it is best phone I've ever bought. It is simply elegant, be its 6000 mAh battery, infinity display, 64mp quad camera setup, and the Samsung one UI 2.0 which makes it out of the box. It's performance is best, its battery works really long, its biometrics are best, screen quality is awesome, and camera captures almost every detail, even in the night.
Overall,  the phone is packed with so many features and it comes in such a price. The phone is indeed a #mega-monster!

I was very much confused among redmi note 8 pro and m31 ... finally I bought m31 6/128gb variant because of its amoled display and battery.... believe me this device is awesome and very good User interface in this price range... u can  go for it..

By looking at the phone you doesn't feel that great, i mean the looks are quiet decent and ok but when it comes to features and performance it's totally bang on. Super Amoled Display, Quad Camera setup with 64mp primary camera at 15k price range will not disappoint you literally it's camera is awesome and yes 6000mah battery despite having such a monster battery the phone feels very light and handy due the the plastic material used at the back which makes it less attractive than other glass back panel.

With super fast processor &amp; sensor &amp; even 6000mA big battery  The phone is super light &amp; easy to cling on to. Battery backup upto 20 hr &amp; super friendly for students as note making is very buttery with swift sensors &amp; it comes with a pocket friendly price that everyone can afford. The phone is a key to Pandora's box, I would highly recommend to everyone, specially to students looking for a education friendly phone in an affordable range.. thanks

I got around  2 days battery life in single charge  but It takes much time for charging  6000 mah battery  approximately 2 and half  hour. My small suggestion  is  Samsung should have provided 25 watt charger instead of 15 watt. Camera clarity of the phone  is good as compared to other phones in this price range and the processor too. The fingerprint sensor and face recognition  is much faster and we can unlock the  phone  within 1 or 2 seconds.

I really liked this phone. It has the best camera quality. It's 6000mah battery is really amazing, it takes about 1:30 hr to get fully charged and the it lasts for more than 30hr with heavy use. I liked it's smooth and fast performance while browsing internet or while using Facebook or YouTube or any other application. It's fingerprint reader is good. The best thing I liked about it is that it has applications of Microsoft.

Worst phone ever... autically booting up and got hanged up at samsung logo.. pls dont buy it and any of the samsung product especially made in india because these are not the quality products.

1.Facing some network issue...
As when being from no coverage or little coverage to proper coverage it take 5-10 minutes to restore the internet connectivity .
2. The front camera contrast is very smooth ,need some contrast and sharpness in the front camera

The first best thing about M31 is its beautiful Amoled display.The ONE UI 2.0 also feels premium and refined compared to that of other competitors.The battery at 6000mah lasts you for days and lets you live tension free.The fingerprint sensor is snappy.The quad rear cameras have great HDR and the 32MP front camera is also great under good lighting conditions.The perfomance of Exynos 9611 is good for normal everyday tasks.

This phone is a beast. The things that could have been focused on are "Fast charging charger as the 6000 mah battery took almost 3 hours to get fully charged" &amp; "Back cover quality which seems to be cheap". Except these this phone fares really well with this price tag.

Battery Life - good
touch screen - creates fault every few days, no option, but to restart the phone, customer care has only one solution, that is to reset the phone and upload latest software. screen sensors behave in
The phone hangs down many a times, while shifting in between apps
overall performance very poor, only good part is battery

This phone is loaded with a powerful 6,000mAh battery along with improved cameras and sleek design. Camera quality is very good and The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach.The fingerprint sensor works just fine and not faced any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good and overall performance of phone is good.....

I chose this phone mainly because of its extended battery capacity, as I am a normal phone user it's a great advantage for me. I have been using this phone for fast 2 weeks and it's working well and the battery lasts for 2 days for a single charge. Overall it's a good phone.

Negatives:
Camera can be improved compared to other phones in this price range.
The charging speed is a bit low as it takes almost 3 to 3.15 hours to fully charge the phone.

I bought this mobile in Amazon, i used only less than one month only phone is not working properly, hardware issues came in my phone. I didn't drop the phone anywhere even no scratch also happened in my phone.
suddenly my phone started restarting again and again and the following issues came,,
1. Mic is not working
2. Speaker is not working.
So be careful while buying this phone....

Was waiting for this one. After using Samsung M30s for a while I moved on to use this. Has been a magnificent work from Samsung. With a huge battery and improved performance, display and camera - this will be the go to phone for youth. If you plan to use your phone for more than 2 years this is a must buy.

Theres no way you wouldnt want to buy this phone. Lets talk about it in pros and cons. Pros- its massive 6000 mah battery packed along with a super amoled screen and a camera with a superior quality in its price range would definitely blow your experience to a whole other level. The only con I felt along with this device is that other companies provide at least a earphone or a mobile cover along with the handset. However this is not the case with m31 thats very sad

Fingerprints reader is good as other brand like mi note 8.
Camera is good as per Samsung m series.
Battery life is just ok ok bcoz I am using with less apps still it works for one day only.
Feel some hanging problem and response is slow as usual with other Samsung phone.
Face recognition is not so good working slow and some time working and some time giving suggesting to unlock via other security unlock option.
I would like to give 2.5 out of 5.

Nice experience in using the phone. Fingerprint reader is quite fast and precise. The battery life(6000mah), I expected it to be quite high but it lasts one day or slightly more and it takes at least 4 hours to fully charge and when not fully charge it discharges faster. Camera is nice.
I wrote so much about battery because it is branded as quite high and I expected more. Overall the experience using this phone is quite nice and I recommend to buy this phone.

I purchased 02 x Samsung galaxy m31 mobiles, one is ocean blue and another is space black.

The phone is excellent in all performance, I never saw  this type of mobile of any company at this price to collision to this phone.

Brilliant in all. Quality camera, battery, lovely LED display, software performance, excellent memory, excellent processor, and all.

I think it is the best mobile in India in 2020.  The brand SAMSUNG.  Love it.

Superb battery lasts 2 days with moderate usage and a day and half with heavy usage
Awesome display . The eye does not ache even after long period of staring at screen . Plays HD video with rich quality
Came is not up to the mark . Recent update gives an up to the low light photos.
Also the macro mode doesn't focus even after waiting an eternity
Value for money and smart features.  Face unlock doesn't work properly in low light

M31 was purchased by me on first day sale, it's a great deal on that price for this amazing mobile
1. Battery capacity is no doubt great with great battery monitoring feature
2. Camera again awesome and its qualities are more than I phone
3. Fingerprint sensor need to improve. It may be more sensitive
 Samsung again set the mindset of the people"we are number one in the world

Overall happy with the product. Infinity display is amazing. Sound clarity also amazing. Fingerprint reader is too quick. I'm an average user so I'm getting a battery life of 1.5 days. 64mp camera is giving very good output. Front camera is an average one. Felt some lag while typing too fastly, dont know whether the app or processor is slow. Hope that can be fixed through an update. Overall very happy with the product. Highly recommended.

Ordered a 128 GB Ocean Blue Samsung Galaxy M31. Though I had to wait for few extra days than expected but believe me the phone is a real MegaMonster- in terms of Features and Quality per se. And the price at which Samsung has put it forward in the market is just unbelievable. Please go for it if you‚Äôre looking for something in range of 15k-20k. It‚Äôs comparable or in fact is beating few products in the market which are in between 25k -50k.

I bought this phone for my mother and did quite a good testing myself. I was initially confused If I should go for those realme phones due to the specs but I am glad I went with Samsung. Majorly due to the after sales service. The phone has amazing battery life, and performs smoothly. The camera could have been better. The display is the best part of this phone ! Good contrast! Also, with the special 'U' notch this phone looks top notch!

One of the all time best phones,  budget or else. This phone has a very interactive UI and the oled screen provides an exceptional experience.  The 64 MP camera, paired with its wide angle and zoom lens is outstanding.  One of my biggest surprises with the phone was the quality of the speakers. For the cost, it has to be the best in market. Have already recommended to every one I know and if you are considering buying this phone, have no second thoughts.üôÇüôÇüôÇ

Camera need to improve by update. It is samsung sensor but detail is not good in picture and night photo is too bad.if samsung fix camera issue then it is best balanced phone in price. Processor is enough for normal uses but not for heavy gaming. Biggest issue in this phone is night picture and detail in picture.

This comes with allot of features in a budget of 16000. The phone gives you an amazing camera, good battery compared to other samsung smart phone, front camera iz really good. The phones comes out with a really good screen which provides a great video quality.

Though, it does not have a secure folder, samsung pay feature, and many othr such deautre. Phone is definately not for gamers, it though supports games but the graphics must be set to medium.

M31 is a great phone with  features person looks
Decent battery backup.
Processor good enogh to operate multiple apps.
Camera quality is good, front camera is above avg.
Display S.Amoled is doing a great job.
At last my gaming experience is good for PUBG, but I feel 6GB ram is still lacking.(I use to play on iphone7 that was on 2gb. Not comparing ios 2gb to this Samsung 6gb but still it was good). Else this phone is doing a great job.

The phone looks promising in terms of features at the price it is offered at.
cons:
1. Battery is not living upto the expectation which was claimed by manufacturer.
2 the sound output from speaker is less which becomes difficult to listen in noisy environments.
3. In screen fingerprint  scanner is something sported by all other phone manufacturers should have been incorporated.

The best phone in this segment. Value for money. Customer support (by chatting) is satisfactory. Excellent battery back up. Finger print reader is fast and works fine Ram management is fine. Gesture works fine, giving you a new n fine experience of tactile (touch) technology. Thanks to the employees of Samsung, whose efforts made it possible for us to enjoy the experience of  such a phone. I am becoming more and more a fan of Samsung. Hope you will love it.

Finger print is little bit slower but okay. Can have better and faster response at this price range as the other companies are providing better fingerprint sensors at this price.

Camera is awesome. No issue at all

You dont feel like you are using 6000mAh batteries mobile. Mobile is not that much heavier. But battery life also need to be looked into as it is not giving 1.5 day charge at least.

Battery and camera is good
The main thing is chipset. Samsung can upgrade the exynos 9611 to snapdragon 730g or mali g90t. But Samsung use the oldest chipset. But the phone is decent.

Segment's best mobile by Samsung:
6000 MAh battery is sufficient to use approx 2 days. Main rear camera is 64 MP, no one can beat it.
Killer performance by exynos 9611.
Good design with 4 camera combination.....

Do not see the negative  comments and withdraw your decession  on buying this phone this is a good phone in this price segment and the cameras are good too better than note 8 pro in almost every aspect and also in terms of ui highly  recommended product for heavy users .but not recommended for  heavy games who wish to play 6-7 hours of pubg. Excellent  phone for daily usage and media consumption go for it.one of the best phone under 15k

Overall Fantastic Phone. I bought M31 after I broke my MI note5 pro
Prons
Best Camera
Fantastic Battery
Best Screen
Very Good UI
Dark Mode is fantastic
Always Display is also very good

Cons:
Screenshot Gesture I didn't liked that great where we have to use palm. It would be great if there was feature Gesture like 3 fingure Swipe or 2 fingure Swipe.
Apart from this no Cons.

I love the Phone.

Excellent phone by Samsung. My first Samsung phone. I am 5.5 years Mi fan. I was waiting for Note 9 Pro but after launch of Note 9 Pro, I decided to go with another brand. I was looking for Super AMOLED screen &amp; big battery. So I decided Samsung M31. Although it is not having very fast charger. Even though it is best in its class.

Best parts are:
Screen
Camera
Sound
Call quality
Weight
Battery

Overall Performance is good , could not find slowness till now (after two days usage)
Fingerprint (unlock) recognition is quite fast
Amoled display is like butter surface.
Nice feature added: "Optimise" to free-up memory.
Phone used to get charged (10% - 100%) in an Hour.
Camera Quality is good but It needs further improvisation.
Best deal in this Price (Rs. 16999)

Samsung M31 is wonderful. I am using 6gb 128gb with so many new updates and features, I am completely satisfied from this phone.
1. No heating issues
2 no lag
3 face unlock is fast too
4 battery life is 2 days with one charge on full time usage it will still last for 1 and half day.
5 More over camera is wonderful too.

I am happy with my choice. Amazon delivered my smart phone on time too. I give 5out of 5 stars for this product. I love my #megaphoneüòä

This is my 3rd Samsung phone till now and definitely the best and after 2 days of use I can say it is Mega and Monster of a phone with superb camera, very high battery life, amazing display, and lightning quick due to 6GB Ram.
At 15999 it is a best buy when compared to other Chinese brands as you have trust of SAMSUNG.
Just go for it üôÇ

Face recognition is not working, battery 6000mah but running life i dont think soo, camera (self and rare camera) is not upto the mark.
Recent update, phone claims that it is packed with gorilla glass 3 (display) samsung making people fools.

I bought this one as they mentioned 6000mah battery
But
1.Battery drains quickly.. doesn't perform like 6000mah capacity....
2. Temperature increases while making calls and charging
3. Camera quality is good n daylight.. but poor in low light

I was really disappointed when I figured that there were no eardphones included in brand new Galaxy M31. And when I searched in faq I got to know that Samsung India wants to gives flexibility to users. This is ridiculous that you now want users to buy earphones separately. At least you should provide basic earphones. The phone is good but I am shocked to know the no earphones are included while some companies have even started giving phone covers also.

After usage of almost 15 days I concluded that battery is not as expected. It takes 2.5 to 3 hours to get fully charged and drained in a day even after normal usage.

Earlier I had moto one power which had 5k mah battery which was far better then this.

Over all performance is satisfactory but battery performance disappointed so far. It works like 3k mah.

Camera quality is good. Battery life is not good but just ok..fingerprint reader is good

Comparable to my previous more expensive  1+ phone. Features and storage are beyond my expectations. The battery life is long enough and can watch movies on the phone whole day long without charging. Best quality pictures in its class. Way better than my 35K One+ phone.
Finger print sensor gives me the comfort to carry out all banking transactions without risk.

I got very much irritated when the phone gets heated just in the first charging and I have to use it when it's heated like cake!!! I don't know what's the reason.  But I wanted to return and go for  redmi note 9. But still want to feel this phone because this is my first Samsung phone.

Have bought balck 6gb ram 128 storage variant.
Pros :
1. Picture and Video or Camera quality is really good.
2. Gaming performance  is also good.
3. Storage 128gb and expandable memory slot gives us the feature of storing loads of files.
4.Has a battery life almost  1 and half days
Cons
1. Since 15w charger its little slow to get charged.
2. Some times phone gets heated on continues usage.

Phone is simply awesome. I enjoy the full display. Though there are lot of other brands which provide same full display, because of Samsung i bought this. 1But the problem is with the weight. You can't handle in one hand. If so it will slip

I never tried Samsung gadgets and in the era of so many new phones, I thought to give this phone a try.
But this phone is trouble, the processing is so slow, the phone Is very heavy. The camera is okay but not good. It's been 3 days I bought the phone and I had put a guard and back cover still the display is dead. I have never seen any display as well as the screen so weak that it can't bear a small tear.Amazon people were also not very helpful.

3. Display is amazing. Very high quality display.
4. Battery power is extraordinary.  Normal usage battery  backup is more than 2 days. Unbelievable  battery power.
5.looks very smart and slim. Not much weight.

This device is a charm to use.  The One UI is fluid and display...OMG : The Best.
Everything is just perfect in this phone. The Widevine support with Dolby Atmos is heaven for binge watchers. Games's experience is also good.
The Battery usually lasts 2 days after normal usage.
The Camera is exceptionally well according to its price.
I just love Samsung.

One of the Best budget Phones available in the market. However the 6000MAh is a huge battery storage option but takes over 2-2.30 hours for full charge. So the way i use my phone, i find it difficult to charge it completely given the time it takes. Also the Camera at the rear is a little popped out from its rear body. So would suggest to purchase a Phone cover as well along with the phone.

Very Bad Experience! I was promised for a 2 days battery life, it actually worked for only 18 hours. I was promised a great camera experience but all my photos were blurred and too much post-processing even in the raw images. However, look and feel part is amazing. AMOLED experience is mindblowing and especially Dolby Atmos sound processing while playing games, watching movies is worth it.

Phone is not recommended
During calls I am facing few issues  like call recording will start automatically or call will go on hold. These could be due to sensitivity  issues and placement of additional menu close to face touch. Never faced these  issues  in my prior  mobiles.

Amazing product. Camera quality is very nice, rear camera gives crystal clear pic thiugh I would recommend a little working on the front facing camera. The 6bg-128gb variant is the best as you get a pretty good ram and heavy storage capacity and it would last long. Product design is very attractive and gives a rich look and I must say they do have value of money. It is worthevery penny you spent. Over all I am more than satisfied with the device.üòä

Although the battery capacity is 6000 mah , it exhaust till 80% from 7 am to 10 pm. No fast charging. It takes more than two hours to charge from 20vto 100 % with charger provided with set.
Cameras are good. But difficult to get clear focus with zoom or micro.
Unable to demonstrate the advantage of micro.
But overall it's good.

It deserves more than 10 starts. it's just awesome...Camera ,battery , Processor everything's unbeatable for sure , If it's in you're budget just go for it, It won't Disappoint you. &amp; Display is tooooo much good with Super Amoled Display, !

Just compare its Black colour with any smartphone and you will be shocked, fingerprint sensor is also so fast &amp; accurate.

tip: Handle Carefully, its delicate. but awesome display and performance...

Overall performance of Samsung M31 is good. But really unhappy with the camera quality. Picture quality does not match with 64 MP camera, even resolution is also very poor. In Macro mode, there is no any option for auto focus. Totally unsatisfied camera performance. May be Samsung will update and improve it's camera software for M31 later on.

I am really happy with my Samsung Galaxy M31!
This is a huge jump for me from my Samsung Galaxy J2 which I was using for quite some time. I wanted to stick to a Samsung and I think I got a very good deal with my M31. Some of its specifications like battery life, camera quality are way beyond other phones in that price range.
It is a boon for me to have bought it just before the lockdown as it has made my work from home quite comfortable.

Today I recieved this product, Found few defects,
1. Though it has "Type-C" cable I don't see fast  charging, mean it takes more than 1 hour to charge 40%.
2. This product produces more heat,  I never expected with brand new product.
3. Performance is not as expected though it has 6GB RAM.

The camera is ultimate after having the primary camera as 64mp. The body of the phone is so sleek that it beats iPhone too. The face recognition feature is the best. This phone is best for people who want to buy a phone under 20,000. I hope all the buyers find it awesome and mind-blowing. I would give 5 star rating to all the features of the phone from the 64 mega pixel camera to the fingerprint scanner

It's a brand and by new feature of customization of many new features such as super slow motion and caputring screenshot style. Phone looks good but there is little bit issue of camera as always in samsung phone. Rear camera is good in day as well as night also but there is little bit problem in front camera as it is not looks like 32 pixel. But if we remove the camera part it all over best product in range of 20k phones

Fingerprint is fine,it take hardly 1sec to unlock,though face unlock is slow.Camera quality is also good unless you compare it with OnePlus or iPhoneüòÇ.
Camera is good too.Battery life is also good but it take 3hrs or more to get full charged.
If you don't believe in Chinese such as redmi,realme,Vivo or etc then you should consider samsung.Otherwise flagship phone are good.

Finally a budget phone which is truly a flagship killer. A blind choice for specially those who extensively use their phone all day long till late night. 6000 mAh says it all!! Macro lens is a very good add to the phone and like always Samsung is very good with its display but to providing it to a budget phone is also an added benifit.
The best part about this phone is even though it has such a big battery spec it feels light and good to hold.

It's almost a week using M31 and overall satisfied with the outcome so far. Like the Camera which is actually a good one specially in night mode. The battery back up of the phone is ultimate and I spend 1 and half day without any powerbank on standby mode on touring. The plastic back of the phone might be not like by most of the user as the fingerprint can easily seen. However, it's a good phone to us especially when SAMSUNG associated with

Battery life is not that much good if you have low range and network distributions battery life is almost one day not more than that, camera is good wide view range is give better experience, fingerprints reader is unsatisfied is not that much quicker or sensitive or not easy to use because it's designe is so flat so take a lot of effort for it. Otherwise its look is better and back panel tuch filling is rich good for handling for one hand.

M31 works perfectly smooth on high performance games. Its display is far better than any other mobile in this range. Its 64MP front camera with 5MP depth sensor allows us to take ultra hd pics but it struggles to auto focus.I does not have front flash which makes difficult to take selfies in dark.It has 6000mah battery which runs for approx 1.5 days on one charge.

Overall I would say this is currently best phone to buy under 25k.

It‚Äôs camera quality is very good and it‚Äôs monster 6000mAh battery is really fabulous.

It‚Äôs built quality is not so bad and not so good.

Excellent rear and front cameras

Display is amazing.

Fast fingerprint sensor  it worked every time without fail.

Battery is very good I get about 2 day of battery backup and it also charges 0-80 % quite fast considering its 6000mah battery.

It's very durable it actually fell from the balcony and survived with just minor scratches at the back.

User interface and Gaming is also quite good.

Although the pictures came out well with the camera, during the pandemic I was required to click pictures of my assignments and notes, and I noticed the mid section of the pictures were crystal clear but the outer part would be blurred. Although you can only notice this difference on a bigger screen like your PC for example.
Overall the phone is just amazing.
Battery life , screen quality and fingerprint sensors are beyond great.

Samsung Galaxy M31 - Batterry life is awesome.. its a jumbo battery. but the fast charger takes 2.5 hrs to charge completely, which is bit high in comparison with other fast charges.
The camera quality is awesome with different features
performance is good, but observed an issue i.e sometime the UI hangs and did not respond. At that time it was very difficult to reboot, access the mobile.

Battery is the main attractive factor and it lives upto its potential......just went 3 days with average usage!!!!!

Camera is okayish....does the job gr8

Multitasking with the processor observed some slowdowns but overall averge smoothness and crispness when phone starts or switching between apps

Lastly the screen is just wow even under sunlight :)

Screen as it says is SAMOLED is truly wonderful.
Camera both fromt and back serves the purpose.
Fingerprint i am bit disappointed,  as it is not as fast as it should be and battery life as it says 6000mah, but i believe it work as around 4750mah which is 1 day on full charge and after having video call for 2hrs and normal use.
But charging is fast as it says at 15W.
Overall at this price one should really go fir this.

You mentioned in 6 installments I need to pay 15999,credit card charging installments not in equal proportion, more over as a Intetest waiver u offered 633 RS as discount,with in 3 installments bank charged 574 rs as interest,what's the logic in showing zero interest EMI.

So its been amost 10 days using this device and I must share that I'm happy with the performance of it.The delivery was done next day only which was impressive,the Galaxy M31 comes with fairly basic packaging. Apart from the device itself, you get a 15W fast charger and a charging/data cable.
Prior to this i was using realme 3 pro and M31 suprasses that in every aspects whether it is camera,one ui 2.0,design or battery.Overall it is a good buy in this price.

Finger print reader is very quick compared to my previous mobile ,camera is at its top class..go some high resolution pics , enjoying taking pics using wide angle option.
Lots of internal options by Samsung as always. Been using Samsung since 10 yrs. First one was galaxy Y (still in working condition) , next was Samsung galaxy S2 (also in working condition) and now this . Battery life is good as of now , with 6000mah , definitely helpful for my requirement

Awesome Display....5* just for the Display.Not a gamer though maybe that's why I am perfectly okay with the performance....battery is okayish I would say doesn't perform like 6000mah ...camera is meh! Seriously doesn't feel like 64 mp...photos in daylights are above average but boy it completely fails at night....feels like Samsung put a good display along with some cheap hardware in a package in the name of fancy title

Awesome device, and hats off to amazon for such speedy delivery.
And so far I m absolutely loving this device, buttery smooth and blazing fast. But its a bit big, afterall 6.4 inches is quite a number. Worth every buck.

Again, Samsung M31  has involved and presented a better-shaped handset.
- Amazing display quality and the curved edged display.
- Best in class camera.
- Better battery life and charging.

To be honest it's an amazing budget mobile. I think it's better to choose Samsung Galaxy m31 when compared to other android mobiles. It has 6000MAH battery life with fast charger. And has storage of 6/128gb and 64 mp quad cam which is an amazing feature. I'm  using Samsung m31 from past 82days and I'm  not facing any problem. If you are seeing for mid range mobile phone with more good features I definitely suggest Samsung Galaxy m31.

Great display- super AMOLED (class apart)
Great battery 6000mah (easily stands for more than 2days for normal users like me)
Above average camera (expected more from 64MP)
Fast fingerprint sensor
One UI - good one (unwanted apps can be uninstalled)
Weightless
Dolby atmos with headsets an added advantage

The display, interface(one ui 2.0),battery is what to look out for this phone....but the phone is full of bloatwares I had to uninstall  many of them also the ram management  is not what I expected not bad though if the price of this phone would be around 14k it would have  been better I don't play game on smartphones  but I didn't  notice any  lag in the day to day activities

This is the best device under 15k range. I have purchased 64Gb space black device. Fingerprint scanner is really very smooth it unlocks device very fast. Camera set is really very good you can take the best quality pictures from rear and front camera as well. If you will trun of the animation from the device the battery life is also very good. Highly satisfied with the device.

The 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy M31 is excellent It has wide viewing angles, vivid colors, deep blacks, and pretty good brightness levels that only fall short in the harshest of sunlight camera battery are awesome.If you are looking for a complete package in the budget segment, then the device won‚Äôt disappoint you.
Main reason to buy samsung phone is manufactured in south korea.

Everything about this phone is very good. From its design to its camera, all the features are awesome. Not to forget its 6000mAh battery &amp; sAMOLED display which again is very good. To my surprise the fingerprint sensor and face unlock is very fast. I didn't gave full 5‚≠ê because we can't use flash while clicking photos using 64 MP camera &amp; super steady mode isn't available for HD recordings.
Overall love the phoneüòç Happy to have it‚úåüèº

For this price, there cant be a better phone. The fingerprint reader is a little slow, but overall, this phone can't be better. The Ram and storage is more than perfect, I can go hours playing PUBG or COD, with no lagging. And the camera, i compared my M31's camera to my friend's iPhone 11 pro max, and our friends couldn't make out the difference, so you know your camera is best, when it's being compared to a 1 lakh INR phone

Everything looks okay,  easy to use, working good, just one issue of screenshot functionality,,,
I desire to have some multi function for screen shots, screen video records,  fully, short  ,and mini screenshot function,  especially in some like Samsung Galaxy m 31 phone.
Hope it's improved or upgraded next time.
Moreover it good for all aspects..

Good value for money. Fast charging is not good. Camera quality is good with live focus and changing effects of portrait mode using the different focusses available with the quad cameras. Night mode is good. Performance is fine. Gets stuck during games a bit. Battery lasts a day when used continuously. Overall good phone considering the features offered for the price range.

Samsung M31 comes with a smooth touch mega amoled screen which gives a very nice user experience. The camera quality of 64MP is really up to the mark. Long lasting 6000mah battery is  something you can not ignore in this mobile.
The only thing which is missing here is a earphone which doesn't  come with the package. Price of the M31 6+128 is also very much reasonable.
Overall experience  is great. Keep up the good work.

Finger print - much faster than any other, recognise fraction of seconds
Battery - as they say it really has monster battery. Fast charges till 75 to 80 % after that it takes to charge and it takes time to drain also so u no need to worry about battery.
Camera - these 64MP camera is really really good those 5MP Depth camera and 5MP for macro really makes huge difference
Additional amoled screen is very good to see

Fingerprint sensor is troublesome didn't always work, the battery life is enough of 30 hrs, in heavy usage, the build is shiny, I'll recommend a cover. The phone is good, not very handy but can be used for hours flawlessly.

Processor  is worse.  Samsung  is still having  hang issues... I don't  have  heavy  apps n data only 23gb of phone mem is consumed but it got hang while  WhatsApp... I ask to return  as its last date  coincidentally and the Amazon  tech  is asking  why I didn't complained  earlier. This is worse experience  I had ever, hope  Amazon  will maintain  its reliability and good  relations with customer and will  return  this  phone.

This is the first time i am using a Samsung Product.
Really i am impressed with it's visual looks and appearance. It's looks like premium.
It's performance is quite good, but i don't know how it performs after two months.
Camera quality is really nice and main advantage is it's battery capacity. It's huge! But phone is not bulky.

Last word, This is very good product from samsung in this price segment.

To be honest it's the best mobile to purchase on this range. It's not a gaming mobile.  But when it comes to daily  basic needs you can go for it and you will love it. Camera is great. Overall performance is good. You can play PUBG with HDR mode for 1hr smoothly .It's a package of entertainment. Display is amazing.
Upgraded processor would be the best job. Knox security and Samsung pay is not available.

Its the best value for money i have put hands on...infact after using this phone i have stopped looking at battery status it self... as one single full recharge of night lasts  like forever... and yes I am tireless gamer playing clash royal and pubg  umpteen times during the day. Camera is so clear and better both front back...besides ultra hd modes of PubG are supported so you can imagine how powerful it is. I am super happy

It is a phone with magnificent battery life and the look it give.
The Samsung Camera is something you even can't think of .
So Many Functionalities included such as stabled video shooting which is as same as any cinematic film.
Camera Lover must go for it
Battery Life awesome with 2 days using full playing pubg,using Netflix and Just using like a hell whole day.
16k is worth to spend
Go for it.

I brought this phone through Amazon. I had decided to buy this phone considering its battery life and 64 mp camera. The phone has got great features.

The only issue where I am dissatisfied is its "In call" sound volume. It is so low that in traffic you can't hear what the other person is saying from other side. I am planning to take my phone to the nearest SAMSUNG service center in a day or two to fix this issue.

At this price range it's good buy. Back panel should have been more scratch resistant. Or else Samsung should have provided a basic back panel , and why there are no ear phones ( for15999) , Samsung could have provided one.
Other than that every thing seems good as of now, will update after 1 month use.

Full of interesting features, compatible processor and an amazing battery life, this phone is sleek, stylish and perfect for anyone looking for a device that leaves an impression. Fingerprint reader works without any delay plus its self-storage optimization comes in handy. Camera has various features along with an excellent picture quality. All in all, Galaxy M31 is a total package at a reasonable price. Worth every penny.

I am really very happy to bought this smartphone. Especially it's really fast working and fingerprint unlock is very good. Also the product quality is really good,Battery life is also good. The one main thing is that the extra Samsung care services is not so good, Samsung is not the customer oriented brand and mislead their customers through there online prices quotes whether of spare parts or something else.
Thankyou!

The only think that I find annoying is that at times the phone auto restarts (thrice as of now) and rarely kind of hangs up on you, other than that Samsung M31 is a an amazing phone to have for its price range. A little warning is that you have to buy a cover since the back of the phone is not smudge proof and scratch proof to a certain degree. P.S bought the phone on the release date

The phone is excellent in each and every performance matrix. Be it battery life, camera, sound quality, display.

2. No HEAT in mobile while taking.
3. No vibration feeling when i kept in shirt packet.
4. Very good screen pixel but single image size around 9+ MB if use 64 pixel.

The Camera Quality is quite good. However  would have liked Pro mode to be better with more manual controls. Fingerprint reader is slower compared to my old mobile but doesn't disappoint in any way. Battery life is enough for a day's use with moderate activity. Given the  battery size, better battery life expected. The mobile is a bit heavier and somewhat lags in performance but makes up for it in the features provided.

Pros: great battery life it can run for about 2 to 3 days on 1 charge.
It's got a great camera.
It's quite fast.
The screen is very responsive.
It's got  a great screen quality the images are quite clear on it.
Cons:
When I first started the phone, the apps took a long time for updating and I was unable to install any apps. This was rectified by switching off the phone then switching it on.

The display keeps flickering whenever I open the camera or check videos or pictures in the gallery. It also flickers when I'm watching videos on YouTube or checking out any application where there's videos/images being displayed.

Wouldn't suggest anyone to buy this phone as there seems to be several issues with respect to display, battery, heating etc..

I've initiated a return of the phone as well.

The phone is quite good. Its Fast as it have a 6 GB Ram. It have an Amazing Battery life of 6000 mAh which last for  a full day without charging while playing games and doing stuffs. It has a good camera 64 MP and a good video recording at 2160p@30fps, 1080p@30fps. The bad thing in this mobile is that it don‚Äôt not come with an earphones while having an earphone jack. That very disappointing. Overall it is a MegaMoster.

Bought this phone for a discounted price of Rs. 16,999 for my mom and I must say it‚Äôs value for money.
With 128GB of memory space, 6 GB RAM, 64 MP rear camera in quad camera set up, it fulfills all the requirements. My mom who is a food blogger needs quality pictures, high storage space and a high battery life. It‚Äôs been a week and she loves her phone. It also has face recognition however, we haven‚Äôt tried it yet.

Loved the phone.
THE BEST DEAL IN ‚Çπ16000 FOR NORMAL PERSON.

Pros-
Massive battery.
Descent Camera (NOT THE BEST BUT NOT BAD AT ALL).
Fingerprint sensor is pretty fast.
Processor is not the best but still a better one.
No heating issues -Played Pubg(HDR, ULTRA), Clash of clan

Cons-
Charging is really slow.
Face unlocking is not at all fast.
Missing that 8gb ram with 128gb variant.

I give 4*for fingerprint reader where 2* for camera quality as camera is not to the score of 64 or 32 Mp rather seems 12 mp and 8 mp. Battery charging is too late not to the standard of fast charging it is taking 3 hours to fully charged. Amazon reply to replacement is harassing

Was not at all satisfied with the product. This product did not meet the expectations. Went by the users review and got the phone. But personal experience did not go well. Frequently gets hanged. 6gb RAM should owe even more, but this product did not turn up like that. If there is any software bug, I personally request for the update of the software atleast by the next version.

Pros - camera quality is good

The one thing that samsung have that non other has is quality. I'm happy with the phone. The fingerprint quality is far better than its competitor models which I personally feel. Battery is a huge asset to this model and deserves much kudos to its performance. I find great joy using the camera in night mode which gave me a new experience.

Finaly, I found something better than anything which I've ever tried.

Great camera quality and great safety features in the phone...the phone is fully packed with features....the super amoled display is soo good and infact both the cameras front and back are awesome...the only minus point is battery...it not that it becomes very low in usage of some time...but if u charge your phone in night at 100% then it will go for the whole day...otherwise awesome phone really..

To keep oneself home during this Corona emergency one must have a phone with higher battery life. It does it. I have been using this phone hours together on FB and youtube... but the battery is learning my style and giving me more. The camera is good enough for the time as I am not going out often. The fingerprint is the best. Basically the phone reads my moods :)

The phone is perfect example of Value For Money. The camera quality is above par when compared to phone from other brands in the same price range. Battery life is amazing and screen resolution is perfevt.
Only downside is added weight due to a bigger battery and missing screen guard in the box

It's display is literally fascinating at this price range. It's features, updates and sensors are well good and decent. I found that it's camera is not upto the mark but it's not compromising either. Being samsung, it hangs sometimes but recovers within 3-4 sec. Overall a nice phone to buy at this price range with a samsung tag.

Overall really good monster in budget comparison.

1. Average  64 MP REAR and 32 MP selfie camera
2. Depth and ultra wide camera a bit more helpful to click a good picture.
3. Resolution of 2340 X 1080 + 16 m color support  give us a nice video experience.
4. 6000 MAH Battery take almost 3 hours to get full charge but work only 1 or 1.25 days
Comparatively a better phone with this price range

It is awsome phone with powerful exynos 9736 processor which make the phone smooth and faster compared to any other budget smartphone and also with 64MP quad rear camera the photo are more natural. With this phone Users can play PUBG mobile at HDR setting without and lag or heating issue. It also had superAmolade display and 60HZ screen refresh rate .over all in my openion it is the best budget phone than redmi and realme and also oppo .

Been using for a month right now!
1) Camera is good but not as good as it should be based on the specifications
2) Theres a glitch between switching modes from portrait to landscape
3) Amazing sound quality. Especially with Dolby effect on headphones
4) Long battery life
5) laggy fingerprint sensor

Overall I'd say that's it's a bang for the buck!
Cheers!

Display quality is very amazing, battery backup is very impressive u can use ur phone for two days with single charge with high usage...but the phone lacks in body material u need to use a case otherwise it will get scratches in a week..and other doubt is that it has slow charging even after having fast charger (in box)..may be bcoz of bigger battery. Camera is also very good and super steady mode is wonderful...

This phone is very good as compare to price... But it is slow many times and in camera... we select micro and other valu added function image quality is very less... Also 64 MP is in 4:3 Format... user can choose the format as per his choice bu it shold full 64 MP.
Another small complaint about the display... when we put it in pocket it should automatice on... also when we on call different screens appear...

I got my Samsung m31 on 26th may since then i have been using it extensively. The battery life is the stand out feature for me, phone is running smoothly without any lag whatsoever,camera quality is amazing click very good photos whether it is low light, daylight,outdoors or Indoor its just amazing. I personally  like macro mode which gives very detailed photos of object.
I m loving this phone.

Unbelievable  from Samsung. The fast charging is good. Charges within  2 hours. Smooth experience in using. The quad camera design  is outstanding. It deserves  a 5 star. Thanks to Amazon free fast delivery.  I received the product in 26 hours after order.Personally calculated  charging speed 0.5percent to 0.6 percent per minute.approx 2hour 42min to 3hour 18 min for 0 to 100 percent on switch off charging.(without enabling fast charging)

I purchased this mobile for my wife. Received the mobile on 7th March. It's been just a month and charger stopped working suddenly today. We are feeling  helpless as don't have any other similar charger to charge the mobile even don't have any backup phone as well. As it's lockdown situation and unable to seek any backup. Phone is switched off from today morning. Pathetic product from Samsung.

A good budget phone with monster battery but Samsung told they provide gorilla glass 3 protection on this phone display but my phone screen is damaged when I carry this in my pocket and I don't know how it is damaged but I'm very much sure they are not provide gorilla glass 3 protection, they are cheating with us and I want my money back very bad product on behalf of screen.

I m writing this review after one Day of usage...
The phn becomes very hot after few minutes of usage...even at the charging tym it becomes hot...
And the phn processing speed is less than average...
Fingerprint sensor and face unlock sensor is too less than average...
My last opinion is that.... don't do for this phn at this price..you may get much bettter phn at this price of another brand

Using mobile from last 10 days and i promised you that you'll be not disappointed by it. Battery backup is just awesome.  Can give you a full day backup with heavy usage like PUBg and youtube. But the only big con is slow charging

I have not seen a phone with that much erratic  charging. Sometimes it takes 3-4 hours and sometimes longer than that. I have done all I could like restarting, closing background apps, closing location and syncing. I feel terrible about buying this phone earlier I got a defected piece which I have returned and now again I am frustratingly disappointed. Also, I think the camera quality is not like 64 megapixel especially macro lens.

This is the perfect phone for anybody. The best display ever by samsung. The best camera for any price range nearby. The body is light. The user interface is excellent. It can also handle long and heavy gaming without any trouble. I play pubg with full graphics without any lags. Battery is supreme around 1 and half days with heavy usage.
It is the best phone in the range and must buy for all in this budget.

I like the Samsung M31. This is a very nice model that I ever seen. All the features are very nice. The most interesting feature is the camera quality and the 6000 mah battery.  And even the sound quality is also very good . Whenever I saw a movie I feel that that I am in the cinema hall. Because the display of the phone and the sound quality. I am very thankful of the Samsung company for this wonderful model.

I love this phone. The fingerprint reader works awesomely &amp; camera quality is just amazing which gives you different modes to click &amp; record the moment.
And the cherry on the cake is the battery life of this phone. After playing PUBG Mobile for more than a hour the battery drops down only around 12-15% &amp; the phone doesn't heat.
Great work by Samsung &amp; great delivery &amp; packaging services by Amazon.

Beast under 16,000 Rs. Must go for it guys . And buy Spigen case for it ,that will give it protection + premium feel. I watched videos saying that it have bad feel in hand, but guys trust me the phone is solid and stylish. Display is awesome,  charging is very fast , battery is fantastic and overall you can play Pubg at highest graphics without any lag .

Using the phone for 3 days now and it's brilliant. The SAmoled screen makes colors pop, the camera is amazing in bright light with great features (slow-mo, focus etc) and app performance is econd to none. Only complaint I have is the performance of the camera in low light. Apart from that, I am throughly satisfied with the phone. 5 stars!!

In 45 days, I am experiencing speaker and mic problems.  Both have stopped working even though I handled the phone very carefully.  I also have a Samsung S8 and it's working fine since  2017.  So, is there there quality issues only with M31?  I hope they replace the faulty phone.  My family also uses a Vivi V15 for 1 year but it never gave problem like this Samsung M31.

I am using Samsung Galaxy M31 last one week.
Upon my usage I am writing this review.
Battery life is very good - full charge after viewing videos continuously one and half day.
Camera is very good - back camera is very good

I am only disappointed with finger print sensor.
Comparing to other mobiles it's taking more time to sense.
And brightness adjustment also sometimes not working properly.

Wonderful cellphone worth premium looks and obviously monstrous  battery life, camera quality is good but face unlocking is a bit slow infact not working properly. Cons I found in this cell phone is that some times it stops working (hanging problem like each and every Samsung cell phone) and face unlocking is very slow but overall a good phone in  this range. I suggest to go for it as overall its worth it

Really impressed by this device... I had really high hopes with the camera but the quality is mediocre 3.5/5 for camera... But the display is something to die for 5/5 to the Amoled screen.. Processor is really good for my use 4.5/5.. Battery life is just phenomenal 5/5for battery even though charging time is long but due to large battery frequent charging is not required... Overall a really good package..

Let me start with what I dislike
1. The phone is really bulky
2. There is not much grip in the phone so i am always scared i might drop it(Can be resolved with a grip cover)
Goods
Flash photography is good
Tried macro that was good too
Night mode better than before
Battery life is good (fast charging)
Finally the display is the best part of it

Some macros uploaded for reference

Excellent device for the price. The UI was one of the reasons why I chose this device over the competitors, and it never fails to impress. Fingerprints are recognized superfast, and overall the device is fast and smooth and handles most tasks successfully. Would recommend for anyone looking for a great phone with a great user experience.

This is the Real Monster!
As Samsung mentioned the performance is really outstanding especially the Camera quality. Battery Life is good since it's not made for 24X7. FHD display and the specifications are awesome for amazing game play. The few already installed apps selection is good as we use most of them in our daily routine. Little heavy, but user-friendly, no heating issues.

In this phone I faced many issues like overheating, hanging,  app download problem from play store, problem during calling also.
Camera is average.
Battery life is not like 6000mah.

Biggest reason I don't like and not recognize purchase from Amazon is they not replaced or refund my money when I complained before 17th March 2020. I'm still waiting for refund that not done till date.

it is a sturdy phone. Build quality is nice.
Camera quality is superb
Finger print sensor is great. Five stars for it. It takes just a  fraction of a second to respond
Battery life is fine. Almost used phone for three days without charging
Output speaker quality needs to be focused upon. Slight disturbance while playing videos and music
Overall nice phone. Will recommend to buy

I purchased the product from Amazon..
Let's start with one line...
Don't buy this phone by looking at the specs...
The camera quality of this phone is too bad..
Dosen't look like a 64 mp camera...
Worst camera I ever seen in a15000 plus phone... as per the specs front camera is 32 mp but its it's actually look like a 5 mp camera... again am saying the camera quality is worst...

1: 4K shoot not possible in this camera..
Its shaking when you shoot 4K videos...
2: Finger print area not useful,  can't  analyzed  your finger is it on or not.......

Overall it's a good phone in the price.
Camera is a plus for this phone. Amazing pictures even in low light.
Screen resolution and colors are really true and gives you an experience.
Battery I see is draining quite early given the huge size it's still a minus point for samsung.
Speed and usability is nice for gamers.

Pros:
1. sAMOLED display is excellent
2. Good battery back
3. Rear Camera is awesome with all sorts of  options

Cons:
1. Front Camera is not very great, fully depended on Software, hopefully the upcoming upgrades will fix the issues
2. Sound quality &amp; volume on loudspeakers could've been better

Will edit the review after continous usage.

This phone is very good when it comes to display, battery &amp; performance for daily usage. Back camera is fine, front camera not much good. Gaming I have not played any heavy games. One good thing is with 6000mah battery it doesn't heat too much except charging time. Overall I could say this phone is worth for this price range. Only drawback is 15W charger. Takes more time to charge..

Overall an excellent phone by Samsung. What surprised me was the battery backup. Even though I play Call of Duty for about 2-3 hours a day, I can go more than 24 hours without charging. The camera is excellent too. The Samsung Galaxy M31 is the best phone I have used till date. Infact it is way better than phones segments above it. Close youe eyes and buy this one. Good job Samsung!

Come up with excellent features, 64 inches screen, primary camera quality 62mp, front camera 32 mp, with super study mode it gives excellent experience for super stable footage and Ram 6GB with internal memory and most imp battery with fast charging, Finger print censor is quick, hearing  Dolby sound with head sets is great experience.

What a mega BEAST completely secured phone by samsung you need not worry about any thing samsung inbuilt features are very useful in set up of phone as wll as exploring the features of mega BEAST the cameras good natural colors and amoled display is at its best and the main highlight 6000mah battery is very much fascinating but it heats up while charging the phone. Camera quality is awesome and the quad cameras are the best

Very best phones for technological people.

Best camera
Best battery life
And all best features.
I recommended to buy samsung m31 , for those who searching for mobiles below the price of 20,000 ..

Awesome phone with wonderful features in this price. Cant expect more. Be it camera quality, sleek design with amazing look, handy grip, battery backup, picture quality or the big internal storage. M31 excels in every field. Sound alongwith great picture quality is like experiencing a theatre setup. I am loving it. Amazing product. Loved it. Full marks for Samsung.

Good in Camera,  Fingerprint , display &amp; battery life. Especially camera is very good. You might not need a DSLR if you have M31 in ur hand.

Not sure if fast charging is enabled. It takes nearly 4hrs to reach 100%. May be it is because of 6000mah..

Mobile handling should be carefully as the outfit is very smooth and slips from hand very easily

Camera of this mobile is very pathetic to be exact . It's not having that much image quality, focus is very bad. Only suitable for normal use . The only pro I found in the phone I found is the Amoled display, which is remarkable . Camera quality of honor mobile are more good when  compared with m31 . The Manuel mode or the Pro mode of the m31 is pathetic . Frame rate and image quality ratio is pathetic

Sometimes phone is not power on rather than it showing zero battery although phone has charged. So you may face this kind of bug. It has 64 MP camera but performance not good and thickness of phone is very high compare to other phone which may be irritate you while you use phone. If you use phone with cover then it looks like very old and thickened phone. Main problem of this phone is its thickness.

I am very impressed by buying this model, good camera features, long battery life. Smooth for gaming. Initially the phone was not available in mobile stores, the staff working their was advising me to buy other samsung models like A8, but I kept my stand on this phone and it was my the best decision taken by me. This phone has better features than all other phones whose prices lie in the same range.

Perfect night clicks with this cam and the clicks on greens are awesome too. Battery life is for two complete days if you are not a gaming freek. This is the one that I was looking for with a perfect cam and processor speed that could hold well all the apps installed. Liking the quality of the pics withthis phone, one of my friends got it too. Great phone overall.

Oh god This phone is literally a mega monster
With its super amoled display its always great to stream anything love the colours.
And then comes the camera slow motion super slow motion and the options goes on and on and even 4k recording on front camera
And further comes the battery which is extremely powerful i can literally stream or play games for hours without worrying about it.

Very poor front camera.... In day light it works good but in low light its works very bad and back camera performance is good.... Overall display is very fine but speaker sound is little bit low... It takes 2hours 38min to full charge. Its too long to full charging as it provide 18w or 20w fast charger will decrease charging time but they providing 15w charger, I was very disappointed in that fact.

After all Samsung is Samsung, the name itself gives definition of power and durability. And to prove this M31 is the best example that you will find.

I am not going to define it in pros and cons becoz that is not necessary since there is no cons at all. Perfect package in such a reasonable price. RAM, CAMERA, OS everything is perfect. PLS PLS GO FOR IT

After 1 day of receiving, device is getting heated up after 5 minutes of usage. Can't hold the phone near ears for calling . It is completely heated up. Tried calling the service centre, they tell that heating issues is not at all a issue. We can't help with that. Completely disappointed.  Did not expect this from Samsung and very bad customer service from amazon

Phone gets heated up while charging  and while on call. One can not use the phone on ears, will need to use speaker  phone or earbuds etc.  Amazon did some remote test and said temperature is fine. They are not willing to return without me doing additional battery calibration and tests for two more days. Did not expect this.  Poor quality from Samsung and Amazon.

U can believe me....Camera quality is awesome. Amazing picture quality and there are many modes like super slowmotion, night mode. Fingerprint reader is working good, no problem as of now. Take a bow to battery life. Charge once in a day and can use continuously for the whole day..if usage is less, can use it for more than a day....At last I can say, I made a good choice by purchasing this mobile.

I think I did a huge mistake in choosing this product rather than Redmi.
Issues with this phone within 7 days of purchase -
1. Keypad hangs in between and nothing helps and I have to reboot.
2. I lock it by smart lock and the next thing I know the phone is unlocked with a swipe.
3. The worst part is I contacted amazon and they ran a check and nothing was found.

Using it for around 5 days. Very good phone, battery backup upto 2 days camera quality is ver good, high-quality display. Not much weight feeling for a 6000mAh battery. Volume is also good. Not much pre installed aps. Good hi provided by samsung. Touch sensitivity can be adjusted as per user requirement. So far I am happy with this product. Timely delivery by Amazon team as well

Amazing phone with excellent picture quality and longest battery  life.
Both front and rear cameras are very good. There are lots of option given in the phone camera to capture your best moments. Slo mo and pro mode are good.
Features like taking screen print with hand gesture are excellent.
This is one of the best phone available with lots of new feature at very affordable price.

Hi All,
I am using this mobile since 6th March 2020.
* Since i am working in marketing domain, Internet / WIFI will be turned on (non-continous) in mobile atleast 16 hours and calls around 30 - 35 calls / day.  My mobile will get "discharged within 1 day" against specified 48 hours so i am rating 3 out of 5.
* The snaps captured is of good quality so i rated 5 out of 5 for Camera.

The operation is smooth and battery life is what one expects grin a 6000mah. The camera doesn't disappoint either, and features are pretty cool.  Three back cover is a fingerprint magnet and it definitely needs a cover.  Probably a trade off for maintaining weight distribution given the battery, but not really a deal breaker... I'd say it's the best for a mod-range smartphones

The finger-print is swift and unlocks the phone in a blink of an eye. The Camera is fabulous. The wide angle camera includes alot in just a frame. The macro-shot camera gives you a real life photography experience. The front camera is fantastic and enhances beauty and gives out smart clicks especially with portrait mode. The battery life is very good and drags the power to last upto 2-2.5 days.

Everything ok but battery 6000 it's fake due to I have redmi note8 which battery is 4000mah after using both phones full day both mobiles are same %of battery
Both mobiles using YouTube but battery same % so I think battery is fake in Samsung m31
Now when I was play bus simulator game mobile is getting hang not operate the game proper

The phone is good so far. Its a value for money at this price I must say. The phone is light weighted considering the battery size of 6000 MAH and the display is good. You get a SAMOLED full hd+ display and its very good. I will if you want a budget smart phone with a decent camera and features go for a Samsung m31 or a m21. You get the trusted brand value of Samsung as well.

The battery lasted 8 hours after a full charge with mediocre usage. The phone got really hot near the camera. Camera quality is fine when provided with enough lighting but low light shots were awful. This speaks volumes about the quality control of these phones. Samsung is out here scamming the mid tier market. If I don't get a proper replacement I'm going to court with this.

Brought a M31 through Amazon and delivered on time. But the phone set is defective. Call voice is disappearing for few seconds and coming back and it is repeating during call. Spoken to many Amazon customer executives but no solution given yet. Even they cant hear voice from this phone so calling to my another phone. Demanded replace but nothing done yet. I want replace that it...no more craps

M31 is having very good camera and pitcure quality &amp; good battery long for almost 1and half day with a resonable price. Fingre print reader is not up to mark but if you want good battery life then you should go for M31. Very important thing is not having heating problem and hanging problem while gaming.

Looks of phone is good and curved screen and new functionality of android 10 is a plus

Samsung M31 is a good product with much better performance and good camera quality. It's a good looking mobile but not so stylish. The fingerprint reader is much faster and battery is very nice. On the whole, I would like to tell is that the mobile may not be stylish but by looking at the performance u will forget about the design and u can but it without a second thought.

Nice phone, good build quality and nice camera. Pics are really crisp. Have not yet tested night/low light photos. In my use of 3days battery has lasted for full day with mixed use of videos(6-7) hours games(2-3) and browsing
One con though that while playing heavy games(PUBG/COD) phone is hanging at times. Yes even new phone is hanging and it takes time to close the apps and restart.

I'm writing this review after using the phone for 2 weeks. Really happy with the phone. Battery lasting for a longer period, I had to charge only once in 2 days. Camera quality is good but not exceptionally good. I would have given a 5 star, but the headphones with the mobile was not that great. And gorilla glass and good back cover was not easily available for the phone.

Camera is just superb! But the battery life is not so satisfactory with 6000 mAh. Biometrics and security is very fast and secure. Display and backside is just awesome. Light weighted,easy to carry,full speed internet, extreme sound quality  and etc etc. It's the best phone under rs 16000. When thinking about buying this phone, don't worry. Just buy this and you will win the superb phone..

Amazing phone overall. Battery lasts for an entire day with heavy usage. It only needs to be charged once in a day for heavy usage or once in 2 days for average usage. The cameras are way better than expected. The display is vibrant. Great pricing too. I found it to be the best among all phones of this range and even ones that are slightly more expensive.

The Galaxy M31 is a well-made device with a good, usable feature set and good performance. I was impressed by the overall quality of the display, the performance, the software experience and especially the terrific battery life. The 64MP camera also takes good quality pictures and this is one of those rare times where i do recommend people shoot in the full native resolution at all times.

The Mega Monster it is!!! It is really fast, the camera is absolutely amazing both front and rear!!
The body feels like it is made of glass, insane front display, best experience ever!!
The battery backup is also good, lacks a few things that other samsung devices had but its okay!
In the end, it's an amazing phone at this price!!!
Worth it, loved it!

Highly recommendable phone with such perfect specs. Camera quality and battery is just par-excellence. Being Samsung it offers so many superb features in accessibility. Worth the price. Just the back-cover is very glossy lest this phone has no cons. Highly impressed by the camera quality, I've clicked some pictures in my recent domestic trip by this phone, you can see them in the attachment.

The thing i like most about this is the battery life and the fingerprint reader, in terms of camera quality its quite ok i mean i wouldnt give it a 5 star rating, other than that the sound quality's also awesome, overall id give it a 4 star rating.

This mobile has an amazing screen even direct sunlight and the camera performance is good . but it does has its negatives like lagging sometimes and hangs suddenly out of no where.... but then when it does work it does ultimate job ....
the fingerprint doesnt respond properly.
Overall i would say its amazing as an mid budget phone but ok if u r thinking of a great performance.,

Phone looks really good and sleek design very impressive with latest android makes classic.
Camera quality is awesome.
Nothing to say about battery when 6000mAH provided where no other brand can beat which is class.
For normal operations it withstands for 3 days in solid manner whereas for heavy usage 1.5 to 2 days.
Processor and Memory are sufficient to do the trick.

Security like app lock is absent which is a necessary requirement today.
One can easily see yr msgs details in notification panel bcoz in setting ,very less option available  ,
Actually i bought it based on what the product was conveying though its advertising but  my requirement was less as i mentioned above,and not fulfilled.

In rest of matters  phone is very good.

Please don't buy this phone as for me it turned out to be a defective product sold to me as it was not starting when I unbox it. I had to call 5 times to Amazon customer care to ask them to Return/Refund/Exchange this product and they were asking me to keep the phone on charging for 4 hours and then if it doesn't start then they will Return/Refund process as per policy.

What i like the most about this phone is the battery life and its design but i am a but disappointed with the camera quality and its processor.It lacks speed and smoothness in multitasking and various operations.I hope that everything will be fixed with new software  update and my review  will be appreciated.Its fingerprint and face lock can be made faster.
Thanks.

recently bought the mobile phone.  look is very good, camera is awesome but as the Samsung is famous for hanging, I noticed it restarted on its own while using two three times since last i bought it  10 days back. If the memory ROM will be full in next few moth I think it wont be able to handle it and hanging and restarting will increase.

Samsung Galaxy m31 is the best mobile in that price range I have used it for a week and It gave me the best performance. So this mobile will give a good competition to other mobiles in that price range
I appreciate samsung to give the best mobile for that price range
Every aspect in the mobile is good
Every specification which is given to us by Samsung is value for money

Well it's almost I've been using since 2months, great battery life, camera quality  is unbelievable in mid range mobiles display quality is amazing pros are more higher compared to cons, there are few cons like some times it gets stuck when u use apps in background, we can play decent games, and face recognition could have been better, total rating I'm giving  4.7, I love this product.

All features r satisfying...and one thing i like most is battery backup...when it comes to battery backup no other phone can beat it.it is really a megamonster. Once i charged it to 100% ...it was surprising to see again 100% after watching a full Netflix episode.that was amazing. And further after a pubg match i found it on 96%. So u can assume how's the performance.

Fingerprint sensors we're very fast compared to Other mobiles.
Cameras were also superb...I thought front camera could be dull but...after Reviewing it...it was superb.
The Battery Life is like really a monster.
Once I'm getting one day Life with one time charged.
Games were also Very Good to play...
Finally A Best Product under little budget.

One of the worst battery life. Takes more than 4 hours to charge. Get discharge in one day. If you use more feature then even less. And almost all the features which looks so big on paper are quite avg in use.

I regret buying this product.

Amazon, please let this review pass your filter. Few of my negative reviews are not public.

It is a OK types Mobile, heavy due to 6000 mah battery . Battery life is around one and half day .  Do not compare this phone with any A series phone A series far better.
Samsung should have included NCF feature in this phone . Sometime it automatically get swith off.
Who looking for budget phone with Android 10  this phone can be a choice .

Once Screen wake time is off, instrument is switched off automatically. Though instrument is charged if we want to switch on the instrument we have to plug in the charger and then we can switch on the instrument. But again instrument switch off in some time
We tried to check the error thru amazon - SmartChk app but this app is also not working, no one on call and chat to guide.

camera quality is poor in comparison to other brands like vivo. oppo or realme. processor is of low quality therefore there is  little hanging problem. battary is good but not as 6000mah but same as 4500mah. so finally ,,, go with other brands.

Best smartphone in the price range of 16000, quad camera with  64 MP, wide angle and good aperture provides excellent pictures. Fingerprint reader given on back panel and working very well. Super Amoled display provides a cool touch performance. Most important is its Mega battery of 6000 mAH which lasts up to 2 days with normal internetuse, after full charging. Excellent smartphone.

The fingerprint reader is effectively faster than the previous M-Series phone launched by Samsung. The camera quality, I would say is far better than what I had expected it to be. And the battery comes with a well curated backup of 6000mAh. It charges a little slow considering other competitive fast charging phones, but other than that it's a well balanced device.

After using using Galaxy M31 for about 15 days that I'm very much satisfied with this product. I've got the 64 GB variant. It's working pretty well. Although the back Panel of this device catch scratches very easily, also the cable provided with this phone is a bit short, but still at this price range this is the best phone with all the desired specifications, that one can get.

I bought Samsung Galaxy M31 in March, its display glass is too delicate,as mentioned it's not gorilla glass.my phone display got damaged as it just fell from my pocket when I sat in a chair. M31 gets hanging ,overheating.
Its taking lot of time for 100% Charging .I faced very bad experience with Samsung this time. Most of the Samsung mobiles getting display glass breakage.

I purchased this item on 7th March. I would say overall it's a great phone according to me in this price range. If you are a core gamer and want a gaming phone then don't go for it, but I play Pubg in this phone its quiet good graphics. In day light camera quality is too good, but in low light it's not up to the mark. Display &amp; battery of this phone is great. You can go for it.

Flawless fingerprint reader - rightly placed behind to have easy access at the same time not blocking any other screen space when phone is in use.
Camera - satisfied with the captures till now. One of the best stability for a point and shoot device.
Battery - USP of m31. 6000mAH helping me not to worry about charger even once during entire day. Moderately high use due to nature of work.

Though bought just two days back, I'm awed at the battery longevity. I can watch series all day and still not worry about battery drainage. Plus, the display and the camera quality.  Do go for it without a second thought.

Edit after using 2-3 months: The fingerprint camera can be a nuisance at times. The camera quality and battery longevity will still have my praises.

Good experience so far. I moved from using a mid range moto, so the camera quality is a huge improvement! On the flip side the sudden increase in the number of unnecessary "Samsung" apps is unnerving. Had to deactivate them all. Otherwise the phone speed is good, display and camera are wonderful. Battery charges pretty quickly with the in the box charger too.

It's been a while since I have started using this mobile. The back camera is marvelous  however front camera needs  more improvements particularly  in low light. It would have been better if flashlight  in front also would have been there.
However  the battery  life is monster and is superb for gaming purpose.
It's a win win situation  for anybody having this mobile.

Bought this phone in launch and initial impression felt value for the money with samsung brand.
Pros
1) screen refresh rate
2) camera
3) battery
4) sleek model
cons
1) for a 6000mah monster battery they should provide reasonable fast charger, the charger they have provided will take 3 times more time when i charged with my 15w vooc charger.

It's a great product , but the weight of the done is little heavy compared  to other products with the same range. And battery life is also good but I was expecting  with the fast charging but it almost take 2hrs to get fully charged. Which disappointed me. The camera quality is much better then the other products. 4I quality  is very much impressive. Thanky

The Jack - of - all - trades phone. This phone has fulfilled my needs which I wanted. The phone is like big treasure in small chest because in a price as low as this I got 128 GB enormous storage with powerpuff 6GB RAM. And the monster camera what to say about. And that 6000 maH battery resolved my problem of frequent charging. That's all I needed. Thank you

Mobile is worth for money. Liked the camera most. Using the mobile since a week. Performance is good and battery is awesome which lasts me for 2 days on a single charge. Since it has a plastic body providing a protective backcover, screen protector will be a added advantage from the company As I couldn't find any protective accessories for my mobile in the market or online.

Wonderful phone. Just an alrounder for the price segment. Super amoled, huge battery,wonderful camera,speaker loudness, are just awesome. I am using this phone from past 15 days. Battery lasts one day easily even with heavy using. Though it takes time to charge but for the battery it is worth waiting. Loved the macro camera(pictures shot with macro camera).

It's a great mobile under such low budget
I'll recommend everyone to buy this device under the range of 20000 as it has very good features with respect to it's prize and for a student like me it is all what I need
The 64mp camera is the best under the range and best for taking 4k videos and slow motion
I everyday record the slow motion videos of my adventure

I love the features of the phone, camera, battery life, storage, processor. The only reason for one star is the phone delivered to me on 12 this month and I am having sound issues while playing media some times. It is pity if a 14 days old phone needs to visit service center.
This phone is also restarting automatically many times a day. What is wrong with the product.

Everything is about as good as you can get at this price of not better (the battery for example).

As long as you aren't looking for ultra-high settings based gaming, this is more than enough for day to days with enough oomph for everything in between.

If you're working on a budget, go for it.

It is really  good phone at this price. You don't need to charge the phone at least for a day because  it has  6000 MAH battery. It has good camera quality  too.

Cons- The body is plastic,so I don't like it. Camera is not thatbgood as compared to other products. It doesn't show internet connection speed. It auto downloads a lot of unwanted apps. Internet Speed is slow. The back starts heating while downloading large files or playing games. Battery drains fast

Really good phone for this price range.
I would recommend this for thise who highly depend on battery and they don't  game a lot.
Major usage of this device is content consumption. Although  gaming can also be done smoothly but wouldn't  recommend heavy gaming of several hours. Battery lasts fir al long time. Charges fairly quick. Overall a phone worth the hype.

Phone is not so good as in advertisement. Every time we have to check screen for any new message,mail etc. I was already use MI Note4, which blinks one indicator with different color for message,mail and WhatsApp message and also during charging with yellow color. Only back up is sufficient for one day working. During video play, there should zoom option.

Ear phone not included, normally it has to be...USB cable head not appropriate to hold the mobile while charging..seems to be a duplicate product by the seller..I'm not happy with the seller. So only 3 star.

In my point of view, Samsung Galaxy m31's overall performance is so good when compared to my previous experience with other cell phones. With moderate weight, this looks so amazing.  The blue light filter is
genuinely beneficial in avoiding eye irritation. The 6000 mAh battery gives a pleasant usage life of around 2 days.
The camera is very good at efficiency.

Really a MegaMonster and all rounder Mobile with in this budget category.
Very Good Mobile in this range to have all that you want from smartphone.
I bought it next day of its launch and believe me, not a bad decision, earlier I was waiting for Redmi Note 9 Pro launching on 12th March. But now no worry. Great deal and suggest you to snatch it.

Ordered on 26th May and delivered by Amazon on 29th May. I must appreciate the unbelievable &amp; unexpected service by Amazon during Corona pandemic.
Glamorous display, outstanding cameras, strong battery, super efficient censors and many more.
Cordial thanks to Samsung + Amazon.
Expecting this support n care from both of you in future, too.

I like the tech specs (battery, camera, perfect screen size for cell phone) but don't like the thickness. And that's why gifted it to my brother :)

The ONLY expectation not full field is sleekness of cell phone like Mi or Samsung A series, if you can work that out.

The mobile is bestest best in its segment. 6000mAh battery goes more than 48hrs easily. The camera is absolutely magnificent. There is zero battery drainage. The one thing that attracts the most is the Super Amoled Display. Thats so much gorgeous. Each and everything in this mobile is uniquely produced. Don't thing but buy.

Awesome phone
 I love it more than my iphone 6s plus. I have left my iPhone and using this and find no difficulty in this transition as galaxy m31 is more better that iphone in every way except just one which is fingerprint reader.  Because fingerprint reader is at the back so it is slightly inconvenient.

Apart from that I love this one

Camera quality is good but poor at low light and too much of photo compression takes place every time and results less detailing and sharpness .
Fingerprint reader is one of the best sensor in this device and very fast and accurate.
Battery life holds nearly around 20-24hrs for a normal usage and with 4G data and gaming usage gives a standby around 12 hrs .
-----

Fingerprint reader is quick... but sometimes it is difficult to find the reader which is at backside
Battery Life is too good.. with a heavy 6000mAh battery you can easily get it for 2 days for a usual usage. Charging time is 3hrs for full charge.
Camera is best thing in this device... you get to very good pics.
Overall its a deal with value for money.

The phone is very user intuitive and easy to use. The core features such as long lasting battery and quad camera are on the spot. From the day of purchase without heavy usage of my phone the battery lasted for almost 3 days. The phone is not too heavy for its size because of its plastic body. All in all the phone is packed with goodness for the price its marked for .

Truly a mega monster. The best display in the segment. Camera is good although low light pictures could have been better. The processor too handles games and multitasking well. The big 6000 MAh battery is just mindblowing. Easily lasts a day and a half with playing games for hours. One UI is good considering other UI's. Overall this is a great phone.

The battery life is pretty decent. The super amoled screen is just  awesome! The camera sometimes enhaces the color in the pic more than what it actually is which is not good. The photos as night disappoint but in the they are very good. UI is great as usual, you just love it. Though the back  is not glass but it still  looks pretty decent in hand.

Camera is satisfactory ( not getting sharpe photos as good as from my samsung S7 ) but still good.

Battery is awesome,  I am business user. Really needed to charge my S7 twice a day. But with same usage I am able to go 1+ 1/2 days.

There are some issues with phone. Need bugfixes software  update to overcome all those over all phone is very good look wise screen.

Hi,

It took around 7 hours to charge for the first time. After dicussion with amazon I discharge it to 0 percent and charging to 100 % took 4 hours. My current charging time is around 3.5 hours. Hope it reduces to 160 minutes as claimed. All this is with fast charging on.

I have been using the phone for past 5 days. As of now i feel, sumsung has kept their word regarding the specs provided. Camera quality is impeccable. Display quality is out of the world. Even though the phone is powered by a 6000mah battery, u wouldn't feel that its heavy. Phone is perfectly balanced in terms of body weight. In short, im in love with this mobile.

I bought this product after I broke my phone during the lockdown. The USP of this phone is its long lasting battery and its amazing camera quality. The display and accessibility are good too. Most importantly its a budget phone. Moreover, being a Samsung product it is very durable. I am really happy with its performance. I would strongly recommend it to everyone.

- Cast issue with android box miracast
- Finger print sensor takes time.
- Heating issue

The best thing about the phone is it's display. The super AMOLED screen of the phone is better than all the smartphone in this range. However with regards to other features it is more or less average. Overall it is worthy phone in the price range. If you are a heavy gamer it might not be a best choice however for rest it is good value for money.

The finger print sensor is pretty good but it misses at times.
Awesome battery life, you get close to 2 days on moderate use. The downside being full charging taking close to 3 hrs but it's worth the wait.
A pretty good camera with a very good video stabilization and good night photos.
And that too made in India!!!üòÅüòÅ

Thanks samsung and thanks amazon for this amazing phone.

Fingerprint - Sensor is really good and safe by providing the relevant protection near to sensor (thought by keeping mobile in surface would damage the fingerprint sensor asset)

Camera - Quality is really good but only thing is options are not seen exponentially need to search lot and explore

Batter life - Its really worth and experienced

Mobile is over heating and not able to do whatsapp video call more than half an hour. It start giving message that mobile is overheated because of whatsapp video call, you call will be ended in 20 sec. Battery backup is also not that much good. For normal use like whatsapp &amp; facebook, it provides backup of 8-10 hours. Camera quality is also not that much good.

One of the best phone ever seen.. The battery lasts for nearly one and a half day.. As the name suggest it is a mega monster... I suggest people that they could buy this phone...

Have been using for two weeks now, superb camera quality at this price point. Great battery, runs for almost 36 hours on one full charge. Getting used to Samsung Galaxy apps yet so have not used them much. Galaxy GUI seems good. But the best quality is the screen. Absolute spectacle of a screen at this price point.

Using since last two months. Camera shots are great, including video quality. Battery life is pretty good, lasts around 1.5 days easily, but charging is not fast enough though. Screen quality is also high end, gets bright enough in outdoor also. The fingerprint reader is just okay, I expected it to be faster. Face unlock is also cool, works most of the time.

Great phone for the price and also giving trust of Samsung.
Does not hang, has a powerful battery and awesome camera. Ocean blue variant looks simple and cool and separate arrangements for camera in back makes it more stylish.
Some drawbacks are: backside of the phone can get hot  sometimes, and photos clicked in low light settings can have grains.

Good quality phone in this price segment for a big battery &amp; non gamer user like me. Display quality of Samsung phones are super. Also, this phone is slim and fit. I like its camera editing quality of background black&amp;white and focus colourful. Charging time is little bite slow against this big batteryhouse but it is not a really big concern.

Battery life could have been better (with 6000 mAh capacity inside, feels though as 4000 mAh)
Used honor 8x with 3800 mAh battery and was better i feel.
Fingerprint sensor is fast, camera in low light or at night a par (but not the best)
charging to 100% is around 3 hrs
overall 4.4

Battery takes some more time to charge around 4 hours but almost stays for one half to two days of regular usage.. touch, camera quality is good.
New apps like Samsung max and camera edit options are good.
Fingerprint and facial display is less sensitive ..
Overall good one in this range

Microphone is worst, opposite party is not able to hear my voice properly, however I can hear them properly. And when I am using the earphones then it's working fine. M31 is just a waste of your hard earn money. Please don't go for it. Even now there is no option showing of replace or replacement in Amazon,it seems that some fraud has been happened with me.

The phone Is not that cool it's battery life is not good it takes 3 and half hrs for full charging and that's not 'fast charging'.Its camera quality is not so good like redmi or realme and it's  RAM  not fulfill my expectation it starts hanging.Overall not to buy if you have better options like redmi and realme for this price.

Initial experience is good.Battery discharge is quick even after closing background applications and services.Camera quality is good. Touch sensitivity could be improved as I face issue while accepting incoming call(Touch sensitivity option is enabled).Fingerprint is responsive, not used the face recognition yet.No lagging found and overall performance is good.

Everyone knows that it has awesome camera &amp; battery but let me tell u that it has a good capacity to catch signals in poor network zone. When u are in trouble, the network matters most. When my friend's phone couldn't find signal, this new m31 saved me n my friend with its strong internal antenna.. Thanks Samsung

That model is quite good in this range launched by samsung. It looks good and battery life of that phone is impressive. But the camera quality is not so much good as a 64 MP camera quality. In other scenarios, this phone is the budgeted phone . You can try if you are looking for a phone under 20,000 ,rupees with a brand name.

Awesome phone with great video graphic experience and camera shots.
One can watch videos movies in full screen .
Battery life is awesome and can last for 2 to 3 days with normal daily and entertainment task of yours
Because of wide internal space problem of getting phone hang again and again never occurs. You can play games of high resolution.

If you want a mobile phone with great camera and battery life Samsung Galaxy M31 is the perfect phone for you. I myself have redmi note 7 pro and bought M31 for my phone and camera quality is enormous and battery is great. If you are moderate users(4-5 hrs a day) on internet it works for more than 2 days.. Fingerprint and face lock features are also great..

I would recommend  this to my friends as I feel awesome from the day 1 when I got this.  As mentioned  it's really a megamonster at this price range.  There are so many features which I still need to explore..The camera clarity is simply superb.. This is my first mobile from Samsung brand.. I am fully satisfied!! Thank you Amason for the early  delivery!!

As we have taken M31
1. Camera excellent quality . its clarity is wonderful I love it.
2. Battery life is not as expected as it shows 6000 Mph
3. The phone is getting heated up.while on a meeting like Zoom or Google meet. it gets off automatically.
4. Please check the ram it says 6GB but comparatively it's not that fast.

I wanna tell u something  it is the best I have ever used  because it  has super amoled display  due to that I feel very comfortable when I touch the screen . Second thing is battery life  I mostly charged my phone in two days the battery life is awesome .
From my opinion  you should buy if u want a new phone  under 15000.
Thanks

I would recommend this phone any day if gaming is not your priority.

Amazing screen
Impressive battery life
Great fingerprint scanner (Coming from Galaxy S10)
Good camera setup (Would've been great if there was a telephoto and not a useless macro lens)
Good build quality (Doesn't feel cheap as M30s)

Nice display at this cost,good battery back up but takes long time for getting full,camera quality .only thing I dont like is the size, looks so fat but we can't expect it to be slim having 6000mah battery inside.a little bit heating problem also arises and hangs sometimes even though having 6GB ram.
One more good thing is so light weight even having 6000mah battery

If you are a camera guy then don't let samsung fool you by showing quad camera it is same as Samsung champ camera. I expect Samsung to make real phones not like MI OPPO Vivo. If you are going for this fone due to quad camera better buy M21. It will save your money and you will not get disappointed.

Thank you Samsung for the monster,

"Battery life"/battery back up was best among all the smartphone I have used,
Cherry on the top was "camera quality" and camera modes (thank you for helping us to capture best moments of our life)
"fingerprint reader" was making our important data/privacy much more secure than before.

The phone performance is really awesome. The weight balancing of the phone have done well with the 6000Mah battery. The display of this phone is superb in which we can see all ultra HD videos and 4k videos. Camera is really nice mainly the back camera with 64mp is very good for take interesting photos. Overall this phone is the monster of midrange phone.

The phone's camera is good both front and rear. I love the Colour of the phone (Ocean blue). The Battery life is good lasts for over 24 hours. The design of the phone could have been better and lighter.
The phone comes with a fast charging charger however,  it takes around 2 and a half hours to charge my phone to 100%
I am happy with the phone.

Great option of Smart Switch by Samsung. No hassle after changing the phone. Performance is good. Camera is also good but not great for close up pictures is what I noticed. I expected a longer battery life as it has a monstrous 6000Mah.

Awesome phone !! After doing lot of research online I found this phone is the best among others for this price range. Camera quality is excellent,  performance is superb, it has a great battery life - I can use the phone for almost 2 days once fully charged. Screen quality is awesome. I am very happy to use this phone. Good job Samsung !!

The Smartphone is overall a great value for money. It is light weight for 6000mah and camera quality is good. Though NIGHT shots doesn't have that much details. Lacks Bixby. Battery backup almost 1.5days heavy usage. Fast charging is enough. Overall design is awesome. The display is the best in price segment as with every Samsung device.

My phone fell out of my pocket, and the screen cracked. It was hardly a 1 meter drop and still the screen broke. Really disappointed with the screen. I have previously used iPhones and dropped it several times and nothing happened.

Lots of plus points. Especially the fact that it has a battery that lasts for about two days after only charging for about 2 hrs. The only drawback I have faced after using it for a few days is that the phone heats up while charging at first. It has decreased and I am guessing that it will be solved after a while of usage.

This is by far one of the best android mid-range phones I've ever used. It has got a really good camera, a monstrous battery, and the screen is just to die for. It looks so so good in hand and has got a good look to it as well and one top of that it has a 3.5 mm audio Jack. Would honestly recommend it to anyone who's looking for best phone in a budget.

Battery life is very good
Screen resolutions is good
Gaming is okay
New UI is good, with Android 10
Overall good in it's category with it's price,
Amazon is good with one day delivery with prime

Love this phone. Bought it 2 days ago and now I am impressed by its performance. All features in this phone including the camera, biometrics, battery life are satisfying my needs. Also the processor is allowing a great gaming performance and a great overall performance. Working very smooth. Also the outside looks are great. Rightly said: MegaMonster.üòÅ

Great phone in the price range, equipped with amazing cameras, both main and selfie. Fingerprint and face id are fast as well. And the best feature for me is the battery life...no frequent charging even after heavy usage. Also very light and handy considering battery capacity. Samsung's brand name always makes decision easier. Certainly recommended!!!!

Bought this after specs and price comparison of various models released in the last 3 to 4 months as I wanted a phone for normal use minus games.  One star less because ejection pin was not supplied.  Your vendors take the pleasure out of online shopping by not supplying 100% of what is promised and paid for.

Samsung launched M31 in reasonable price with decent features, the best part I like it is about the heat. I have been using from last 4  days and I don't see any heating problem.

Camera quality is good and getting good shots, the processor is up to mark, I can say it is the best in this price range

It's an exceptional phone in every way possible but heavier compared to Samsung's flagship. The facial recognition is not great but the fingerprint sensor and the gestures are on par with the latest tech on the market. Great camera set up but I personally expected better performance from 4 cameras on the rear

It's an excellent product for an excellent price. The camera quality is wonderful and the phone is easy to use. It's light weighted. But the screen gets scratches soon if you do not have a screen guard on it. It has a plastic body because of which it has heating issues but it's manageable. Over all it's the best product offered at an affordable price.

This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

After a software update sound problem started to occur. You have to restart the phone in to order to fix it but is a temporary solution and lasts 1-2 hour.
I never liked Samsung in terms of Software and Hardware (which can last longer than 1 yr) but still I decided to give it a try.
To anyone who is thinking to buy it, don't.

As this was my first samsung product I felt as below
Pros:
Full Charging time : around 90min to 120min from 0% to 100%
Standby of charging : till the next day avg it reaching to around 50%
Camera: simply superb
Cons:
Nothing much as of now, but expected charging time some wat low but still it is good enough.

Fingerprint is not that much quick but yes reasonably good response.
Camera quality is also good.
Though it say 6000 mah battery but it does not stand for 48 hours. On an average it gives backup around 26-30 hours for average use. But overall it's good phone in this budget.

Dislike, because my galaxy m31 bought on 7th March 2020 is not working for the past 3days. It worked only when charging time. Now it has stopped working yesterday onwards.

Everything about this phone was good when I purchased, recently from past few days its taking more than 2 hours just to get 40% charged. Earlier it used to get 40% in 1 hour. Maybe there's a problem in the charger or in phone. The camera quality is very good. If only the battery were to be improved this phone would be the perfect buy.

Samsung Galaxy M31 is very good mobile under this cost by samsung.The phone display is awesome and nice UI but one disappointing thing is it lacks some speed.This phone is light in weight and very compact to use.It feels great to use than other phones.The battery is too big and sustained very long but i think samsung could give more fast charging.

Except for the camera, most of the features remain the same as Galaxy M30s. Overall it is a good buy. However, it would have been better if they have provided upgrade SoC, and added few features from Galaxy A series such as Kid mode, secure folder, edge screen, edge lighting, etc.

Good quality Camara both front and rear. In day light results are much better. However results in Night are poor and not up to mark.
Location and design of Fingure sensor is not satisfactory, sometime we have to find it by turning back.
Speed and display are the best part and USP of this handset.
Overall good handset in this range.

If you are willing to spend 16k for a phone go for it without a second thought.

With some pros and cons the product is worth it's money. Face recognition could have been better and the phone heats up a bit while charging. Apart from that, it is smooth to use(doesn't hang), good battery life, fast charging, great camera, Impressive UI and the phone doesn't heat while using it. Probably the best phone in this price range..!!

It takes way too much time to charge, for a fast charging phone this is very disappointing, but the battery life is good.
It's barely been two days and my phone has already changed twice, not happy with this at all, the camera quality is  good was a 16k phone but I do notice a lot of airbrushing in selfies which makes them look artificial.

Fingerprint sensor is very sensitive, camera is very nice sharp and brilliant photos with real life colors along with excellent video quality, battery life is also very good.The 6000mah battery gives you full day backup with fast charging. In a nutshell I would like to say that M31 mobile is full value of  money with great features and quality.

Writting review after using 8 days. This phone is good by performance. Battery life is superb.

But very much disappointed because of Camera, I brought this phone for camera but very much disappointed after clicking photos, very poor quality camera given by Samsung.

I would say its Megamonstar except Camera.

The first thing is the best quality  product  in this range.  In terms of performance  phone is very good. User interface  is very attractive.  The battery  backup  can last up to 2days depending  upon  your use. Very good for photography, if you have skills  then you don't need DSLR camera.  Look is very stylish and bold. I love the product .

The battery life is good. Audio and speakers  are good . Easy to use.

Display is big but looks dull and static( my best half has s8 so may I didn't feel encouraged).
charging is not as quick as it said to be. Native  Samsung browser is more resolution  friendly than chrome. Text is garbled in chrome for given screen dimensions.

It's realy worth the money , but finding it bit difficult with the speaker's the volume level is very low , while using the phone the touch screen is activated with ear touch and lots of action like call recorder, mute  ,hold and so on the screen off sensitive is not effective
Over all its good ..I like it ...But will change it after a year

Worst smartphone I have ever purchased.  MI 16 MP cam gives better photo than the 32mp cam of samsung. The worst thing I found is network issue. You will never get full network anywhere. Internet speed is lil bit more than 2G network. I rang to the customer service and they advised me to change the sim cards with new sim cards.

This phone is really cool and has some really cool features. The camera is awesome, it takes clear and crisp pictures. The AMOLED screen is really great with awesome viewing angle.
Just the problem is like every other Samsung devices it hangs sometimes but that is forgivable for the price and features u get.

1)6000mah Battery which easily lasts more than a day even for heavy  usage
2)Quad camera setup gives good performance
3)6.4inch Super AMOLED display is one of the best in this price range
4)Exynos 9611 gives smooth performance even while multitasking
Overall it's complete package if you're looking for phone under Rs.15000

I have one samsung tablet mobile SM T331 for the last 5 years without any trouble/faults. Hence on that confidence, I purchased  samsung M31. I satisfied all the functions such as taking best photos (camera), more than one day battery life and good response of fingerprint reader. But one negative is poor face sensor. Except that all is good.

Reallly a mega monster in every sense. Speeed display battery all good. True value for money.  I suggest must buy. Black colour is better than blue. Charging speed is bit slow. Front camera quality is inferior wrt 24 MP. But yes back camera quality is quite good. Noght mode is very good.

The best phone I have had so far.The finger print sensor is  excellent and very  sensitive. The camera quality is very good and  the best part is the battery life which I have to charge once in two days for which I am very much thankful  to Samsung Galaxy 31.The screen color and the sensitiveness is excellent. The best phone in the price range

Received in very good packing and best smartphone in 15k range.
It has been almost 1 week and downloaded many app and tested, no lag in games and really fast processing between app switch plus bigger advantage is battery life which stays for almost 2 days after full charge.
Worthy product.

Camera quality is great does the work better than almost many phones out there
Fingerprint reader is on point and accurate and it's very fast

This just might be the best phone in its own price range

Phone looks good. But i think battery is draining little faster. It could probably be because of low signals in the place where i live, the battery is draining out fast. Otherwise all good.  Best in the lot in the market to pick in a budget mode.

Amazing performances. Nice fingerprint and it is responsive too. Amazing battery life as a smartphone. Good quality camera in this segment.
One more important specialty about the model is its size and design. Not that much weight is feeling. I am using as my second phone then also manageable.

Nice phone and worth of money.

Using this phone from last 4 days its working so nicely Camera quality is awesome. battery is also good you can use it one day without charging.

Nice battery Backup.. Camera is descent..
Due to 15W charger,charging your phone takes a little long.
While charging sometimes the phone gets a little heat may be due to 6kMh battery..
Overall good phone in this price range..
Being samsung loyal user choose this phone instead realme and MI.

I like the over all performance of m31. Main highlight are camera (great contrast and colour) and battery(no doubt u will get 1day+ battery life easily). Having a 6000mhz battery u will not fell heavy in your hand. Over all processor performs pretty well.. i will recommend to buy and rest of you use it and decide yourself.

I bought this phone as soon as it was launched in Amazon..  have been using it for more than a week now and should tell u neither amazon has disappointed me with the service nor Samsung..  both stand for their brand value. For the phone 5 star rating with all feature and also 5 star rating for amazon for the prompt service

Rear camera and front camera, battery  capacity, processing speed and all other features like quick face recognition, android version, camera features, in built AR emoji and Bixby
vision are phenomenal.

That's why I am giving 4 start...

After using it for more than 1 week, I can see this, that this phone is worth the money. I'm a designer and I use phone's camera almost everyday and that is amazing.

This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Was looking for a phone from some time which is good overall I.e. battery, camera and performance.
M31 really stands out in all those categories.
Also it provides all features you will find in a flagship mobile phone.
Go for it if you do not change mobile frequently.

A good phone with certainly excellent eatures which are available in high end pricey phones, camera quality is good, processing power is fast, battery back up is really good. Face detection is to be made more accurate otherwise other biometric sensors are working fine.switch windows with hand gestures is something which is very new.

Overall this handset has value for money.
1. Can be used whole day without any worrying of charging.
2. Processor speed is also good.
3. Photo quality is good.
4. Appearance is trendy.
5. Since battery is 6000mAH, charging is bit slow due to low rating of charger. Hope Samsung will upgrade the charger rating.

Even though it has a 6000 mAh battery, it is quite lightweight The battery performance is good, it can easily last for a single day for normal usage with a single charge. Galaxy M31 packs great camera sensors. Photos are vibrant with a good dynamic range. I haven't experienced any lag till now with my 3 weeks of usage.

This is an absolute superb phone from Samsung ,firstly great because it was in my budget of 16000 ,secondly because of its huge battery backup which provides me almost 40 hours of battery backup for all my call chats video calls and thirdly because of its huge screen ratio it is very easy to navigate view

1- Touch is sometime I feel not working properly.
2- Fingerprint  is lagging few times
3-Charger is fast charging but it taking longer time for complete  charging.

Rest all good,Front Camera is awesome,Battery life awesome

It has been three days I have been using this phone. A great phone worth its price  battery is a real monster which last for more than a day.  Camera is just like cherry on cake ot stunned with when I took selfie in a dark room  its clarity was just like day time. User friendly and doesn't even heat on playing heavy games like pubg.

Regretted for buying it cheap quality body, video quality not upto the mark, mice quality worst as the person could not hear clear voice during call, no split screen function many more issues with the phone. This is the bad phone from a huge brand. Will be happy if get replacement....my suggestion to buyers don't buy it waste of money

It's a very good phone from samsung..after some fluctuations samsung came with a good design and operating system and a powerful battery life and nice camera in it.. mostly I prefer this phone to all who wants to buy a phone with a budget of ‚Çπ15000 to ‚Çπ16000

Finger print scanner is not very fast. Camera is good for outdoor photography but doesn't perform well while shooting indoors &amp; in low light conditions. Battery life is very good &amp; lasts upto 1.5-2 days with moderate usage. Weight distribution is v.good &amp; phn doesn't feel heavy while holding in palm. Overall a decent package in 16K.

Truly a monster at this price point
1) 6000 mah battery is what makes this phone a winner for me.
2) the quad camera setup also takes some amazing shots.
3) Screen is also very nice.
4) in display fingerprint reader works as a charm.
Over all i am satisfied and will highly recommend this phone

I have use camera since month fingerprint  reader is just like a liquid flow, camera quality  no doubt  as it is 64megapixel best thing is more option and wide angle.Battery like a boss no need no worry for 36 hours full net and utilisation.

Overall it's Super AMOLED display, Exynos 9611 SoC and 6000 mAh battery.
Pros.
1. Terrific battery life
2. Attractive AMOLED display
3. 64 MP cam
4. Smooth software experience.

Cons.
1. Poor low light camera performance
2. Processor should be better.
3. Common design.

M31 is best in range if you compare that Xiaomi and Vivo..I have given my research and figured it out that this phone gives me best battery back up and has all the necessary features which I required. It comes with wifi calling which is the best part given the situation with service provider signals..My recommendation is "Go for it"

Very good phone to use superb battery and touch

Only cons what I feel is somewhat heavy and speakers are on down side so sometimes when u are in crowd u can't hear the same properly. U need to place the same near to your ears to hear properly.

Rest all its value for money budget phone

This is an amazing phone. Its user friendly. Also the features added to this phone is worth every penny. Good specifications such as the quad camera setup and a 6000mAH battery and that too with less charging time is a boon. Performance wise too this phone will not dissappoint you whilst not putting too much pressure on the pocket.

Great battery backup runs 2-days on average usage.  Camera quality is good but not up to the marks.
I think Samsung is also going only for the pixel war, not for the quality. Gaming is also lag less, becomes hot at the place nearby the camera while gaming. Most Important things no any advertisement popups. Worth for the money.

The phone has an unbelievable battery life as advertised, as I tested it for a continuous 4 hours of video call and the battery went down only 20%. The amoled display is amazing, with some amazing lockscreen functionalities. The gaming performance is exceptional with PUBG playing very smoothly on high graphics. All in all, it's a catch at this price.

One of a best phone available in mid range segment. Camera and battery are standalone along with Samsung one UI version 2.0 provides one a best UI experience. Best bid to for this if looking for a standard one.

Rear Camera is good but Selfie doesn't perform well. I never keep any kinda lock in my phone so can't say anything about fingerprint reader or face unlock. I felt this phone has some heating issue while sharing movies and when kept at standby this has some battery drain issue. And yes Charging really sucks it takes almost 3 hours.

Really nice
Value for money
The display is super awesome
Hats off to its batters mega monster in deed
A whooping 6000 MAH battery is the first thing u would need when u are far from any power source.
The camera with an additional wide angle is perfect to shoot on all conditions.
Perfect.

I usually prefer xperia handset but my friend suggested me to use Samsung M31 and just after of 4 days I really appreciate this product. Finger print awesome battery life also good but if you think it would run for 2days then it won't and it all depends on use. Now talk about and it's amazing and just don't waste time and buy it.

The phone is exactly what it claims to be.  I stay out of my home for most of the day so I required a phone with longer battery life and this phone completely served the purpose. The camera quality is outstanding and so is its memory. If you want a phone which is a complete package of all good qualities, this is the one for you!

Fingerprint sensor is very okay in this phone though camera is very good but according to the specifications on paper it doesn't perform upto the mark n major disappointment is it's battery a phone with 6000 mah battery should get u through 24hrs easily but this phone will survive without using it heavily around 14 to 18 hrs max

The 6000mAh battery is quite impressive..

First time gone for Samsung  product and will never go in future. Quality  of camera is not yet all uptown the mark (64 mp). Battery with regular  use will last 1.25 to 1.4 days max. Heating issue is also there. Sound quality avg. Only plus point is samoled  is very good. Better to avoid.

First of all I'll start  writing about this Mobile's fingerprint reader which is so best.. that it take mini second in opening.
Camera is way to good...üëå

This 6000mAH battery makes this mobile rough and tough to use and no fear of battery down...

I've purchased this mobile for my mom and she loved it

The phone runs really smooth , it has a good screen rate , the fingerprint reader is so fast but the face recognition is average and the screen to body ratio is also so good..its too easy to operate with just one hand..nd it has better screen resolution too.

The phone is overall excellent, like these many features in a very cheap range. It's amazing. Been two weeks since i purchased it, and it works so good. Just that the work should be done on the face recognition. Too slow to unlock, doesn't recognise all the time. Would be better if they improve it. Overall, this phone is good!

I have just received my new Samsung Galaxy M31 this Saturday. I must say this phone is the best you can get in this amount. As it is loaded with all the features and it's USP the 64mega pixel camera is what you don't get even in phone worth 50k and above. I would recommend all the people to go ahead if you are still thinking.

It is one of the best mobile phone under this price range with all features that could be in it and one of the best feature is it's 6000mah battery and the amoled display.camera quality is excellent under light but its little dull in low light.Processor is also nice at this range of price . Overall the product is 9 out of 10.

I brought my frist mobile with latest version and so many better options. Samsung galaxy m31 is a newly launched phone. While using internet it was too fast and not hanging.

It is a sleek phone which makes it more comfortable to hold. The camera quality is good except for the night mode which was not so impressive. The battery is long-lasting and charges roughly with 2-2.5 hours. The ONE UI 2.0 is amazing! If you are looking for a mid-range phone, you should consider buying this Mega Monster!

The phone as such is good but there were few issues initially but now after about a week it seems to run well and is smooth, the camera isnt as great as it was told to be but honestly for the price it is really good. The phone is easy to use and customisable for your own preference.

I have been using Samsung Galaxy smart phones (for a decade) starting for Galaxy S2 and I was never more happier with the camera quality.
The finger print sensor on the back works like a charm.

A great asset to have.

Giving five out of four stars because the content in the box like case is missing and in my point of view that is very important if you still not getting earphones but the smartphone is fully packed its battery life is amazing also camera is there so thumbs up to Samsung

Display is excellent. Battery backup is amazing but charge take little more time but negitable because of 6000 mAh battery. Finger print sensor is faster to unlock. Poor performance in face unlock. No heating issue. Overall performance is good. Clear audio quality. Camer quality is good not expected level. Best in hand.

Very good phone. The only negative is that it takes alot of time to get fully charged. Except this, I did not face any problems. The camera is very good. It clicks decent photographs in low light also. Speakers are good but they are located at the bottom side of the phone so the sound might get blocked. UI is very good.

I like fingerprint reader and good camera quality beacuse of 4 cameras, live focus and macro zoom but about battery life it will come only 1 day, but they mentioned it will come 2 to 3 days if you use continuously for games also.
About processor, it didn't stuct till now but some times keyboard won't work properly.

This mobile is not what Samsung claims .. All claims are false .. go for MI or oppo phones..

Camera not upto mark of 64 mp.
Battery drains so fast  . Claim of 6000 mah is just marketing stunt  ..

No ear phones and no case and no screen guard comes in package along with mobile  ..

Lemme start with the display colours are vivid out door visibility is good.
Processor isn't orientated around gaming however for a normal user it is more than enough.
Having 4 different cameras is a boon plus there's a great image optimization software
Finally
Battery life is phenomenal

Under this price cap, M31 is the best with regards to features like fingerprint sensors, battery life and even device performance is top notch. It's worth to try one and come to a conclusion of the choice you made. I conclude
by saying, it's the best choice I made for myself.

I always prefer reliable brands and so selected Samsung Galaxy M31 over many hi fi phones available in the similar range. Charger should charge more faster. Charging cable is very short. Cover and headphone should have been given along with phone. Overall a good phone.

So many flaws. I've honestly tried to love this phone but it's not what I had expected. User interface not so great, it's still from 2012.
Touch screen is not that great. Fingerprint reader is absolutely pathetic.
Buy ONLY if you're getting a serious discount.
Avoid otherwise. Not as awesome as expected.

It's a phone that gives you real smooth experience of handling an efficient phone. Screen is superb, camera fantastic and processor fast and battery powerful. The only issue I noticed during two week's use is that after long internet surfing, the device gets heated. Overall it's a value for money phone.

If you don't care for benchmark scores and just want a device that covers the basics needs and has great AMOLED display, has great battery backup and has a beautiful set of cameras, the Galaxy M31 is best in the price segment. Don't forget the 'Samsung ka bharosa' as well. Go #MegaMonster.

Great in this segment,sensors are pretty fast a little heavy in weight due to 6000mah battery, camera design is very prone to scratches so make sure you use a cover,(clear cover not included) camera colours not very accurate in artificial lighting but selfie cam is really good, design is user friendly

The M31 is excellent in every aspect from camera to gameplay. The processor is very very good.
But the problem are the HEATING ISSUES .
The phone gets a little hot even when using it for call and videos for a short time.
Also it also takes much time to charge itself.
Allover phone is excellent

This phone's battery takes a lot of time to charge. It takes around 2 to 2.30 hrs to charge. Very unhappy about it. Moreover, Amazon's return policy isn't that straightforward  as it only ensures replacement and not return of the product. Never expected Amazon to portray their replacement policy as return policy.

The product is received in good condition and nothing to complain about. Face recognition appears to be not very consistent. Picture quality is not bad. Battery life is very good. It would last for 2 days of normal usage. it is a decent branded phone, particularly with low SAR value for Rs.16,000. can go for it !

Very good product given the price range, battery backup is good 2 days for sure. Front Camera is too good and 64 MP camera could be better. Samsung Brand is a plus. Using it since its 6-Mar-2020, no issue found yet. Price is a Plus.

This is a great product by samsung. I personally love this very much .The Battery and One UI  is mind blowing .I greatly suggest this phone unless you're a professional gamer. Cons are there is no inbuilt pro mode for the camera  and aslo the charging is kinnda slow .I hope Samsung will optimize the camera soon.

Big powerful battery, classy Design, The device worked pretty smoothy. The fingerprint sensor located on the back also work quickly in unlocking the device, quad camera setup gives a good photography  experience.... some disadvantage, consist design with water proof protection, Doesn't have a infra red sensor...

The overall experience us nice. The phone is slightly fat as compared to other devices but this is just because the huge battery. The UI is smooth as always. The only glitch free UI in the market. The price increased due to gst and it costed me 1k more than usual price but it is still worth buying.

After use of a week, everything seems super till now. Camera quality is amazing, battery life is also very good and fingerprint reader is also good. Front fingerprint reader would have been better but for this price, it's ok. Fingerprint sensor should have image clicking features. But so far everything is great.

Best budget phone.this phone has a 64 mp camera too and that takes pretty pictures. If you want gaming experience this phone is too nice at playing pubg.this has a 6000mah of battery and even after playing pubg for 45 mins only 10% battery was reduced.Nice design. Totally worth it. The screen is looking amazing

Good phone for people who don't have time to charge phone regularly. But yes you may face hang problem in the very beginning and also the camera quality to not that good its just okay. And fingerprints reader is just fine it also need improvement. But overalls is cost effective and good phone for busy people's.

The mobile is overall good. The only issue is with the charging time. It takes around 2.5 hrs to get it fully charged and then also we get only a day's worth of use.
Its slim and very good looking phone. Bought it for my father and he is very happy with it.
Performance wise he is happy with the phone.

Simple design for others but best product for me in terms of configurations, others might not found anything interesting in this phone because they are judging a book by it's name and cover not it's content. For me it's a simply beautiful product within my budget. I'm really feeling happy to review the product.

Each and every feature of this phone is amazing. You can't get anything better than this in this range. But recently I have started facing one challenge. When I attend any meeting on zoom app, it starts giving error  "phone is overheating" and i am kicked out of the app/meeting. Can anyone from Samsung contact me regarding same.

Perfect for under 15000 if u want a clean ui and frequent clean updates in android.
1 con is that the 64 megapixel sensor is so big that it blurs out the background even if you dont want to do that and the size of 64mp image is small
otherwise best in price range
-----

It's a best phone at this price range, the 6 GB RAM makes multitasking easy. The processor and the RAM doesn't make my battery drain (Thanks for 6000 Mah battery).
Camera quality is awesome in daylight, but the picture has noice during night even at night mode.

The phone is very good as of now..Best thing is battery life..once the charge is 100%  we can use it for 2 days at regular usage.but it takes around 2.15 hrs to charge full..The charging speed is quit slow. That's the only problem I notised as of now.

The product is a beast in the mid range phones. You get the highest battery , the highest camera setup. The only thing i would have wanted if the screen was a little bit more bigger.

To sum up i would definitely recommend to you.

My first mobile with 128GB space and 6GB RAM. Mobile with this space and RAM for reasonable price is the reason why I went for it. I like the colour and the display is full size screen. Camera is awesome. I browsed and compared many mobile models and website and chose Samsung M31.
Happy for choosing this.

Front camera is of no use, cos the quality is very poor.

Battery backup is good but taking around  4.5 hour to get 100% charge. Itni der me to mera 15000 mah ka powerbank charge ho jata hai.

Company is claiming that the phone will be charged in 2 hour 15 min but it is taking too much tym.

The battery life is the major highlight of the smartphone, which no other competitor is offering right now at this price point. That said, we felt that the company could have bumped up the processor in order to give a stiff competition to its rivals.

Really waste of money..  i never ever used this type of cheap phone before. Samsung told that it has fast charging.,  but more than  4 hrs needed to full charge and battery will empty in one day use..
Phone hanging is the other issue..
Plz dont buy this and dont be a fool...

The battery of the phone is long lasting with the moderate usage. I got almost 3 days of battery life with moderate usage with 9 hrs of SOT . The camera performs really well. The phone never lags in performance it's really a worthy product for this cost range.

The phone is amazing. Good battery life can last up to 36 hours with a good internet usage and video watching. Sound quality is also good. Would recommend other who are looking for a value for money phone. But still couldn't understand why Samsung kills his own other a series models by m series.

It was just amazing! As before purchase I were quite confused regarding it's compatibility as well as other features in comparison to other brands in the same price. But now I am fully convinced.

Even though all the specifications are very competitive to any other product in this category they did miss to add the earphone in the box. 15W fast charging is not that fast and takes 3hrs to charge the battery to 100%  and it's good that the battery discharge considerable and can use the device over a day.

Everything about the phone is great. I think it takes some time to get used to the headphone Jack placement as it is on the bottom and I wish there were more colour options available. Other than that the phone is great. The camera quality, fingerprint sensor, battery life and the face recognition are great.

Poor quality product. The phone battery backup is useless and it cannot be called 6000mah battery phone. Camera quality is poor. Phone supplied to me was defective and had software issues too. The phone kept on vibrating unnecessarily.

The Samsung M31 6gb 128gb Ocean Blue Looks Too good and nice. Works well, speed is too good. AWESOME Experience of battery Life. Camera Both sides are fabulous. I really very Take well Experience of M31. It's a Value of Money. It's all the about the Mobile in one Word. Extra Ordinary in Reasonable price.

I would really recommend buying this product because it's worth the purchase, I literally didn't have to charge my phone for 2 days straight. Good battery life, amazing camera quality the sound volume is also really good. Samsung has really got a good phone in the market for such maintained budget price.

Overall a nice phone in this price however the fingerprint is not that accurate. It does regognize a lot of times. The main thing I was surprised with is that having 6000 MH battery it gives the same battery life as a 3000 MH phone. It only runs a day. I guess you can't ask much from a budget smartphone.

This is must buy device... has feature equivalent to iPhone 7 Plus along with a stronger camera. Yet it response time is lesser than iPhone 7 Plus. In the same size this is a power pack deal. Must opt for it if want value to money in this price.

Best battery in all mobiles. Camera quality is improved than before. But still zoom camera pics not good. 64 mp camera just ok. Fingerprint reader is working well. From 9 into 10.
Music is good.display superb. Good choice for busy user, because of battery working more than one day easily.

(Review basis 7 days of use) Look and feel is great, amazing camera. The display is good too. The battery is everlasting...one full charge would easily last for at least 36 hours. The charging is a bit slow but that compensates the longevity of it. Good buy in this price segment.

I like its UI and Ocean Blue color is best in looks. But in some parts I found that it is lagging and I am unable to download from playstore when phone is locked, maybe after updates it will be resolved. Apart from this samsung M31 gives premiumness looks and it is my good experience to use this phone.

Big Battery life &amp; a good camera is what you get..  If you are looking for storage space this has more than 90GB for pics &amp; videos... Don't expect top of the line performance when using games and till now no heating issues.
Everyday apps &amp; SM are a breeze...buy this if you like value for product

Video quality is not very good and fingerprint sensor is slow sometimes. The build quality feels cheap as of plastic back and will get scratched super easily so not soo durable. Screen Is good, superb battery, real good macro shots, camera performs poor in capturing nature(plants,trees)

If you want a budget smartphone which can give competition to many others in high range you can go for it without even thinking for a second. The camera quality and the battery life storage space is the best in its range. I would recommend it every time you ask for a review undoubtedly.

Average mobile, I am not satisfied with battery backup, I think 6000mah should be back up uptu 2-3 days, but one full day is enough for this mobile. Picture quality is also very simple, there is no any difference between this mobile and 8-9K Mobile. Overall not satisfied in this price.

This is called a camera phone
Excellent camera
But they might have given bigger charger, coz it takes around 3 hours to full charge,
Btw display is just beyond the world
Nd processing nd ram management is also good
I think it's worth buying this phone in this prize segment.

A wonderful product worth every paisa spent. Camera is awesome. Performance is also great. Only issue is with battery, though it says 6000 mAH, I feel that I am not getting the kind of back up expected. I am not an avid gamer. It lasts me only for 1 - 1.5 days.

With the specs it is a real Value for money phone. Lesser SAR value of M31 was one of the reason why I shifted from iPhone. I hope i will not be disappointed after using it for few weeks. Key factor for me will be the call quality and security. Will review it further after using it for few weeks.

There is a issue with the m31 I bought, pubg isn't working well on this, I m not sure of it's the same with all the m31 phones. When I restart the phone and launch the game display runs smooth for the first time and when I exit the game and launch it again, game display gets blurred.

My new m31 is a great phone, its preety fast in access, finger print, face recon is also prety fast.Only thing it fails is battry backup even with 6000mh it will be sufficient for a day only if you dont use your phone for once. Its exhaust 20 to 30% battary on a single few min calls.

The battery is awesome and the phone is not too bulky either. The camera is high quality for thia pricepoint. Would have appreciated a flex cover in the box. Amazon service in lockdown times was good, as always. I would recommend the product as one of the capable mid range phones.

The product heats on whatsapp calls. Camera quality is inferior to MI and Poco phones in the same price range.
Fingerprint scans very rarely. Face unlock is also too low response. maximum time we will try the pattern or number.
Haan.. It at least gives the Made in India, Indian Feel

Finger print is really good but face unlock s not that as I was using vivo v9. Face unlock needs to b improve. Battery is good, I usually use bluetooth and get a lot of calls the whole day, this device gives me a freedom from charging it again and again. No words to Express about the battery.

Thanqu samsung for this amazing phone in this mID  range price . Best camera of 64 MP and a front camera of 32 megapixel and a faster fingerprint also. Best phone of the year in mid range should be given to this phone
A long lasting battery of 6000 mah is best and charges only in 2hours.

Get very hot while making call. Having Battery drain problem. Get 100% to 0 in 14 hours in idle mode, and maximum of 4 hours when normal use. Face unlock not work properly. You can add 3 finger prints at maximum
Main Camera is OK. 32mp front cam also good. But Macro only deserves 1 star.

Every thing is fine n superb.  I could say that the mobile is excellent at the price of around 15000. Small issue - when your mobile heats I.e., gaming or in charging.  Mobile finger print sensor could not recognize your finger print.  Later it works when it cools down.

M31 offers good battery life. I've used different phones but everything turned off soon once it crossed 15% . But m31 still stays for you ;)
Running out of words for the camera quality. It comes with a quadcam to give your pictures the worth it demanded :D
I would say " go for it"

Huge Battery
I got 6hrs screen on time and still had 62% remaining.
The viewing angles are good.
Gaming is average and it can be expected in this price range.
Pubg defaults to HD and high. And HDR Ultra is also working but HD and High give better graphics and rendering..

This phone is a complete package for users with moderate multimedia requirements. Good camera, good audio quality, good video quality &amp; an easy to use interface.
Only concern is that it takes about 2 hours &amp; 30-45 minutes for charging. I wonder if anything can be done to improve this.

Fingerprint reader is quick.
Camera Quality is great.
Battery is long lasting min. 1 day after using...
There's only one drawback that is the Charging speed, it takes 2.5 to 3 hrs to fully charge.
Else the phone is good.

Worst product of Samsung i have ever got , within one month of purchase product got crashed while updating.  Since this has happened during lockdown i can't get it repaired and have to wait until service centers are opened.
I don't recommend to buy this product at all.

Awesome battery (6000mAh)first of all.It lasted for more than 2 days.
Camera quality is so good that the number on the car plate can be seen  after taking the pic from 4th floor.
I am fully satisfied by this product from Samsung at this price.

Loved it.

If you put it in charge in 20 percent, then it is charged in 3 hours when the mobile is turned off.  If you turn on the mobile and charge it, then the flower is not charged in four hours

I also have a M30. It has a  problem with video  camera. While  recording videos the brightness changes periodically on its own without  any change in external  circumstances. I am glad to say that this problem is not there in Galaxy M31. Other features of this phone M31 are excellent.

1. Camera quality is good
2. First time in my life a phone with decent battery
3. Processor is good, no lagging
4. Design of the phone looks trendy
5. Touch is great to play game like PubG.

It seems okay - performance wise. But charging is slow. Samsung gave a 10W charger only eventhough the phone supports 15W charging. This is pointless savings - probably trying to sell of their old 10w chargers.

It is a average phone, desighn is so so, not good, camera is good not very good, battery is good not very good, charging is slow, app lock is not inbuilt, for privacy it's a worst phone, user interface is very bad,
Only one thing is awesome that is its display...but small in size.

After using nearly 3 months Every thing is worthy in this product including processing speed, camera, screen clarity, battery life etc.

But while WhatsApp video call 2 out of 5 time it over heats. And calls disconnects.

Phone is pretty good at this price. It is light and fast. It has only one problem - heating problem, the phone heats up quite frequently and the temp. is also high when it get heated up and you can not use apps while it is heated up. Apps will automatically close when it is heated up.

Decent processor

Great battery life even after extensive use of data for a complete day, it lasted for two days completely.
Camera is good but not great
The mobile back is curved which makes it look huge. But it's less weight and the super amoled screen is so smooth.

phone is amazing value for money
but charging cable is too short unable to use on regular Indian wall mounted plugs
at the price of16999/- we samsung users surely deserved a headphone and a clearcase
samsung would have not gained a fortune excluding these items from box

Than the phone starts.
Horrible!!

It's a good phone in this price range but there are some thing that can be made better like the fingerprint scanner takes 2 or 3 attempts as well as the quality of shake mode in camera can be made better but overall the phone is an excellent choice

Brilliant screen and good camera. 64MP not upto the mark.

Battery life in other phone with 4000mah is exactly same as Samsung 6000mah. Also it is bit slow than we expected seeing the feature, ram etc. I am also seeing software issues but that could be limited to my device.

Super device.. Im totally happy with this device. I was previously using a xiomi headset, when I started using Samsung m31 it was totally a great experience with samsung super amoled display and one ui 2.0

By look product is beautiful. Battery life is not as per 6000mAh and can not see 6GB ram performance.
2 years old 5000mAh battery of my mobile gives better performance than this 6000mAh.
Product has lot of things but doesn't deserve for this much of cost.

Greatest budget phone by world's number 1 smartphone manufacturer. The battery life is excellent..no matter how heavy usage you have, you need just one charge in a single day. Fingerprint sensors and camera is equally good.
And on top of that, it's made in India.

Everything is excellent, the only problem I'm facing is slow charging, even after having super fast charger. It took me 1hr from 10%to 65%.
Also it dosen't have SHUTTER TIMER in camer for PRO mode.
And Rs.16,999 MRP which is little bit high for 6Gb/128Gb.

The camera quality of the phone is very good, it's that good that i have developed a hobby of clicking pictures since i started using this phone :) Also the battery life of the phone is great so plus one for that as well. Just the fingerprint reader does not works efficiently.

Amazing phone. Best parts are its design, camera and display  . Performance is best in this price group . You cannot compare it with anyone. It's such a beast .only one thing charger is lil bit slow to charge such a huge battery.  Weight distribution of phone is pretty cool no one can imagine.

Tho the phone is brilliant the packaging was utter nonsense it seemed the seal was already broken and then put again  because I could see some dust inside once I opened it. The box also had some dent on it. I would say go for the product but try some other seller.

I was using note 5 since 3 years . Since past 6 months  battery was discharging fast . M31 has excellent battery . Fingerprint reader is amazing. Camera quality is good.  Cons . Cost cutting measure like short charging wire is causing inconvenience but manageable.

My two biggest needs were: a decent camera and a good battery life. M31 delivered on both fronts excellently, offering a whopping 6000 mAh battery life and a four-camera setup that is on par with some of the best you can get. All this for 16k is an absolute steal!

1st time I am using  Samsung brand smartphone..
It is really awesome . Samsung M31 is so good  to use and it amazing mega monster  battery backup also. Camera Photos are really good in day time and I like it . But full charging  it take nearly  3 to 3.30 hours

It's good quality mobile  from Samsung. Awesome camera,battery but need to improve  little bit in design. Price  should  be 1k less for this model. But overall  it's amazing and is best then redmi,realme and many other in this price  segment. I suggest  go for this.

Best phone under this budget because of best 64 MP quad camera, 6000 mAh battery life, big sAMOLED display, better processor etc. which make this smartphone super....actually I was waiting for this phone around 2 weeks. As and when this phone had launched, I purchased it.

Would recommend to daily heavy users, not heavy gamers. You can play lag free games but not on Full HD graphics. If you are a decent gamer like 4-5 hours a day of gaming it would be a perfect option. Other than gaming it is excellent in every aspect.

Camera quality is impressive but finger print reader and face recognition could be better. It has good battery life and will last 2 days without charging if you are an average user but if you tend to watch a lot of videos and movies it will last only one day.

The phone is worth the money. Has a good battery life as promised and the camera quality is also good. The fingerprint reader is prompt and the phone hasn't hanged yet.

From an allround perspective this is a beauty in all its functions and features offered. But I felt a little draining of battery when watched videos for long hours.  Anyways its preferable choice for a normal user, who is not obsessed with gaming.

The best things I found in this phone is its battery life and process which lag less and the thing which I dislike is its front camera and company is not providing any tempered glass, earphone and back cover with phone which other companies generally provided with phone.

In past I have used almost all brands like MI, OPPO, VIVO etc.
First time I am using Samsung Brand M31 (Indian Brand)

2) 6000 mAh battery (2 Days Life)
3) 32 MP Selfie Camera

Camera, display and battery are awesome.  My only concern is that,  headphone Jack is too tight. I'm not sure whether this is only with my unit,  but it becomes difficult to put and pull the headphone Jack. The same headphone is all good with my Nokia 6.

Money regarding phone is not good .like 64 mp of camera is only for telling.battery is good but not working whole day .there is no gorilla protection it's only for writing.if we want to see full gorilla protection then buy Nokia 7.2 is good and 48 mp camera is better than 64 mp

Hi All, please don't buy this phone one of the third class quality product from Samsung. Camera not even 16 MP quality and company mentioned 64 MP. You can shoot video at the time of evening or night.
Battery life also very bad I think not even 2000 MAH.

Camera Quality is mind-blowing. Battery usually takes 2.5 hrs to charge and will easily last for 2 days if you are a normal user. Face recognition lags a little but fingerprint dominates this minimal problem. Display feels so good and dark mode gives an extra spice to it.

Main focus was battery life which is very durable.
Camera quality is also adorable.
The screen should have been little bigger in downside.
Performance for free fire is osm
For gaming it is perfect.

Awesome product.  Using a Samsung mobile for the first time. Ultimate battery. Buy a good back case(spigen was best). Camera is also good. For a normal day to day use the phone is more than super. As of now I don't repent my decision to buy this.

Phone is getting too much heat while playing Games and Watching videos. You can't even hold the phone and Touch the screen. The heating issue is the major problem in Samsung Galaxy M31. Other than that, Everything is fine.

It's absolutely great phone. Within a week of purchase I tried its camera features along with response time navigating between apps. Within this price range It already feels like a premium phone. I am already making my husband jealous  with 64MP camera ;)

One of the best phones at this range, period. I can't praise the Samsung os enough, the cameras are phenomenal, the phone handles heavy games with ease, the battery life is amazing and it also has a strong build as it has gorilla glass. Highly recommended

Camera quality is as poor as VGA ones.Weeks after using it i dont find anything fancy (except memory and storage)about this phone and not worth buying.Samsung may just be losing the touch with so many releases in one year wrt quality assured per release.

Its a great phone for the price. Stable build quality. Battery life is awesome! The 6GB RAM with the octa core processor makes it an awsome gaming device too.

The finger print identifier does work very smoothly. That is the only issue i found.

The best you can get in this Price. The Camera is fabulous, works flawlessly with Android 10. Doesn't even when with a couple of games and a few apps loaded. The best part, its not a chinese product !

Galaxy M31 is by far the best budget mobile I've ever used. I just wish it was compatible with Samsung Knox. I really hope Samsung will start rolling out Knox into its next line of budget smartphones.

If you're looking for a phone with a good battery backup, display and camera then M31 is best choice at this price. It would be better if they provide back cover with the phone itself. I'm not a heavy gamer so battery lasts more than 24hrs.

Awesome phone with a mega battery which will easily last for atleast one and half day with mild use. Camera is good. Fingerprint reader may be a tad bit slow for some but it's good. Amoled screen and Dolby atmos sound are of top notch.

It's too heavy, feels like am carrying a brick with me and hangs a lot, from performance point of view it's a failure for Samsung.
Touch is not great as well. Only thing to cheer is the camera and sound.

Been using this for a week now.
Camera is of excellent quality.
Especially the macro photos.
The battery life is amazing.
The fingerprint reader is not as quick as in other mobiles , but it is also a good one.

I purchased the phone on March 2020 till now the phone is excellent didn't face any problem except automatic restart.  It is happening majorly only after long time idleness.  Other than that Samsung Galaxy M31 is simply superb.

The thing which Samsung has to increase the length of data cable.
And company should provide a back cover with the handset as there is no cover in the market which fit to this phone.
Otherwise the phone is awesome. üòä

Display and camera quality works as they mentioned.
Quick fingerprint reading.
Battery life - Can use phone  actively  for two days for a normal user

Felt like, 6GB ram is not completely  usable

A basic headphone and cover should be with the phone. Bcoz when it's with the box it's always compatible and fit with the gadget. And after using it for 2 months its heating up fast and reboot automatically any time in 2-3 days

The best thing about the phone was the screen it's just so vibrant.
The downside was the positioning of the fingerprint reader, although I am getting used to it.
Other than that every other thing is best in price.

Battery back up and camera quality is good. Finger print reader is in rear side is good but expected in display or side in power button. If mobile is slim and weight is 170g will be good to handle. Performance is also good.

I am very happy to have Samsung Galaxy M31(6 gb ,128gb).Both selfie and rear camera are awesome.The display is cool and very smooth.I think this is the best phone under Rs. 20,000 with 6000 mAh battery.

After one week of usage, M31 is worth for the price quoted.
Phone is very good in all aspects.
The only dissatisfaction is Camera quality. It's not up the mark as per the given specifications.
