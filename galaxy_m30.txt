The camera quality  is disgusting,  and It doesn't fit the description of 48mp.
Even when there are no apps running, I am getting only 2.8GB usable ram.
When I am asking for a phone replacement for defective piece, associates deny it by stating that we don't have any proof for product being defective.
I am a prime member since a long time and this is how they treat their old customers.

Bought it for camera, 48+8+5 is just on paper, picture quality is just 5 MP, even a 2500 phone clicks better than this...front camera is super pathetic, it's 2mp.

Don't buy this item guys. Go for other options.

It's a worst choice. Wastage of money.

PROs-

Just one Pro ie 6000 mAh battery, but for that Battery backup You will not throw away Your hard earn 14000 rupees.

CONs-

1) CAMERA quality is big draw back. In 14k You will get Redmi Note 7pro, RealMe X,Xt with better camera quality than this.

2) Panel is of low quality plastic which is giving crackling sound. Which is annoying and worrisome.

3) Super Amoled screen is just a myth, no brightness adjustment, hence more battery consumption.

4) One UI is pathetic. Not for old people in the house.

5) The promises made by Samsung is not up to the mark, and it is not acceptable by a BRAND like Samsung.

6) With this type of build quality, Camera and display, price should be at 8999 maximum.

HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.

PLEASE, DON'T BUY this phone, otherwise You will regret later.

Nice product. the phone is not bulky even it contain 600 mah massive battery. this is the main plus point in this price point. the second advantage is the processor. Samsung has used the most advanced processor i this price range which can handle multiple complex situations except heavy games.

First impressions...
*1-week update added.

For now, I can only compare the M30s with the Asus Zenfone 5z and a OnePlus 3T, both of which 'were' flagships of the respective brands. In the past I have used Motorolas exclusively. I 'was' a big Motorola fan and consider stock android as the best user experience on a smartphone.

Pros
1. Display 5/5 – Big, Beautiful but more importantly a well-calibrated one. It's easily better than the Oppo and Vivo AMOLED implementations, simply because Samsung has taken the pains to somehow calibrate each unit.

2. Ergonomics 5/5 – You are unlikely to call this device bulky or cumbersome for one-handed use because of the 20:9 aspect ratio, excellent weight management and OneUI optimisations for one-handed use.

3. Battery Life 4/5 – 11-12hrs SoT for me i.e. 1.5days use. Frankly, it's a bit disappointing considering that my older Motorolas gave 6-8hrs on 13nm architecture SoCs, had 2,700-3,000 mah batteries and had less efficient LCD panels. At 6,000mah it should've given close to 14hr SoT, for my use-case.

4. Performance 5/5 – Very fast app opening speeds! Compares very well with the Snapdragon 821 powered and phenomenally well optimized OnePlus 3T. Falls short of the Asus 5z, which is a no-brainer. RAM management is decent too, of the 4GB RAM I tend to have 1.5GB free. 8-10 non-game apps are typically always in memory. UFS 2.1 is a Big leap for those of us upgrading from eMMC storage. This is particularly noticeable in both app opening speeds as well as in the gallery app where Images and Video thumbnails load instantly. Deleting is also super fast!

5. Touch Response 5/5 – Fast, precise, with low latency. Particularly noticeable on the keyboard, quick toggle menu, as well as when knocking off notifications or deleting feeds on say, the Chrome browser. Faster animations further this experience.

6. One UI 3.5/5 – It's difficult to rate it because I've ALWAYS used stock android. And although I enjoy the add-ons OneUI comes with I also miss the clean, fluid, conflict-free experience that stock android is known for. Mind you, this is FAR better than the Chinese ROMs that I tried out in offline stores; ColorOS, FuntouchOS, MIUI and even ZenUI. OneUI is less obtrusive, cleaner, has no ads and is easier to use one-handed. OneUI isn't flawless, I have experienced app crashes (Tata Sky and Palabre) on when I never faced any issues with them with my previous phones. It does ship with bloatware, asks for a LOT of permissions, has unrequired 'suggestions'. Though all of that can be shut down within 5mins. What you do have to put up with is – stutters. You see them from time to time. It may not be a deal breaker, but yes  it's clearly a step-down from stock android. For me, if Stock android is 100... Oxygen OS gets a 100 too, One UI gets 85 and ZenUI gets 75. The other Chinese skins (MIUI, ColorOS, FuntouchOS) are definitely far more heavily modified and further away from the core experience android is known for.

7. Call Quality and Cellular Reception 5/5 – I actually placed calls from all the weak spots at home where signals drop to just 1 bar. Thankfully the M30s doesn't drop signals more than other phones that I've used in fact it's a shade better than the Motorolas I had previously. It's not a mind-blowing signal-catcher either, but yes I do get internet on my Jio sim where sometimes the other phones would struggle. Call quality was Good too, slightly better than the 5z but just short of the OnePlus 3T. Compared to 5z, the sound is sharper (but never sibilant) as opposed to being slightly more muffled and recessed in the upper frequencies.

8. Reliability/Peace of mind and a vast Service network.

Cons
1. Build quality 3/5 – Its a unibody plastic build but a rather flimsy grade of plastic has been used. You can feel and at times also hear the plastic flex next to the power button and the fingerprint scanner. The button themselves have a short travel and satisfactory tactility. Most Chinese phones (which I checked out at offline stores) offer a better build and have Gorilla Glass too, which is rated higher than Schott or Asahi's dragontail (used here), especially in terms of drop protection. For scratch resistance this should be ok, hopefully.

2. Charging performance 2/5 – 2hrs 30mins is very 2015 (6,000 mah, I know). Perhaps an 18w charger helps shave off 15mins or so?, I'll give an update on that. What's more irksome is that if you are using the phone while charging it significantly slows down charging speed (3.5hrs or so!), this is a difference you can't miss. It does not happen on the other devices I have at home, to this extent.

3. Cameras 2/5 – I've used SLRs/DSLRs for over 2 decades so I understand a thing or two. Which also means I don't expect phones, especially at this price point to do great. Even with toned down expectations the cameras are rather poor. The '48mp' Detail is absent, dynamic range mediocre and there's over sharpening/ringing too, though colours are thankfully more natural than I expected from Samsung. Frankly, the '48mp', '64mp', '108mp' number dropping these days is wayyy deep into gimmicky territory because these things at best may be a tad better than older 12/16mp modules, when implemented right. I can only say that it's nowhere near the 12mp primary camera on the Asus 5z (especially with gCam, at night). What's good is the Video Stability &amp; super slow motion feature. Stabilization is actually better than the other two, especially surprising if you know that both 5z &amp; 3t have OIS, this does not! I will update this section if/when I can compare it against its class.

4. LTE speeds over Jio 2.5/5 – A bit disappointing actually. Here it's more like the 6-series from 2018. Even with UFS 2.1, app downloading over Jio was very similar to the older phones I've used. Nowhere close to the 3t, leave alone 5z. Mind you, the Snapdragon 7-series is FAR closer to the 835/845 on this category.

5. Heapdhone quality 3/5 – I'm not a hardcore audiophile but I've spent a small fortune on audio over the years. The m30s has a lively presentation with good dynamics and respectable detail but the frequency response isn't flat. The bass is clearly boosted and the upper frequencies are muted. Its definitely a flavoured sound unlike my Moto G5 Plus which had phenomenally clean audio and superb stereo separation (price no bar!), with my Audio Technica ath-m50, Soundmagic e10c and Beyerdynamic Byron I never had a complaint. The M30s has better detail for sure but it's a more central ('in your head'), less neutral sound. The Hidizs Sonata HD is a good option if you want a solid upgrade for around 2-2.5k, if you want to go cheaper still try the pixel Type-C to 3.5mm dongle there's a lot of praise for it and it's available for just 1.3k or so.

6. Lack of XDA love – The XDA community showers tons of love to Snapdragon powered phones in making them cleaner/slicker/customizable with Custom ROMs because Exynos is locked out by Samsung :(

7. Speaker performance – Not bad but certainly nothing above mediocre. At least it's not that ear piercing, shrill sound that some models at this price point are plagued with and its loud too. OnePlus 3T has a significantly cleaner, tighter output. I won't even bother drawing a comparison with the 5z ;)

8. Android Update track record – I found that Samsung has one of the slowest update speeds, 6-10 months after official release (if you're lucky!). Which probably means no Android 10 until March 2020 :( May be things change in the OneUI era?

First impressions, a full 5/5.
I'll update with Long-term findings.

--- 7th October, 2019. 1-week update ---

One UI experience.
So I've begun to appreciate OneUI in its entirety. The stutters have reduced, I guess when the phone was new there was a lot happening in the background. Besides, some of the intrusive stuff was still running which I've since force stopped and disabled.

The features that I think are great additions over stock android...
1. Open in pop-up view – True multitasking! A huge plus in my book.
2. Always on display – A great feature to have on an AMOLED display and a 6,000mah battery.
3. The screenshot toolbar – it's well designed and the added functionality is much appreciated.
4. Gesture based quick app switcher – A neat and well implemented way of quickly moving through apps
5. 9-band Equaliser – The presets and the fully customizable graphic equaliser have system wide effect over audio, a very underrated feature.
6. Dark/Night mode – Android 10 will bring this at the system level. But it doesn't hurt to have it at some level already, even if its only for the system apps.

What I think are half-baked or unrequired features...
1. Aggressive auto brightness – The ambient light sensor almost always chooses a brighter than required output.
2. Assistive touch – 2 pages to swipe through is a good idea but most of it is of absolutely no use! And there's no option to customise it either.
3. Screenshot shortcuts – They've given 3 bad ways of doing it. And the award for the worst experience goes to... "Palm swipe"! Not only is it inconsistent but also senselessly cumbersome. 3-finger swipe on my Motorola worked flawlessly and was faster too. I tried the Assistive touch but that always-on-screen button soon became an eyesore. So I ended up with the Power button + Volume down key :(

All my other 'first impressions' remain unchanged.

A piece of advice for prospective buyers:
If the negative reviews confuse you, please understand this – The negative reviews are by people who have either...
1. Bought the device for the wrong reasons.
2. Or have unrealistic expectations from a device that was available under 12k, at launch.
3. Or have a genuine issue with a bad unit (a very small percentage).
4. Or are paid trolls!
Most of the negative reviews seem to fall in category 1. &amp; 2.

The USPs of this device are...
1. A Very Very good display – It's accurate, most cheap AMOLED sporting devices are not. Which is why you get unnatural skin tones and unrealistic greens/reds with some other mid-range phones (Mi A3, Realme XT, Vivo z1x etc.)
2. One UI – A FAR cleaner alternative to Chinese skins/ROMs
3. Excellent battery life – 11/12hrs of SoT!
4. Fast app opening speeds and RAM management
5. Reliability!

I ordered a case but it hasn't been delivered yet.
Despite that there's not one scratch on the display or the back!

You will be disappointed if you are buying this device particularly for...
1. Build quality
2. or Camera performance
3. or Charging speed
4. or Superfast updates
5. or for making NFC payments (via Google pay or Samsung pay). Though not many outlets accept this in India, at least not in Tier 2 cities, as of 2019.

Also remember that all other alternatives will come with their own set of drawbacks too.
Can't have it all, not in 2019 at least.

Rating unchanged, fully satisfied "for the price paid!"

An awesome phone for the price paid. Got it delivered within few hours of placing the order. The M30s has a pretty interesting triple camera set up on the back and the selfie shooter too is decent but the main focus has always been on the 6000 mAh battery which hopefully will last 2 days.

I got a 10% discount on my SBI credit card and in addition to that I received Rs 1,000 cashback as Amazon Pay. Hence it would cost somewhere around 12K which is pretty surprising. I am very much impressed with Samsung.
P.S. I am testing the camera, battery life and other stuff and I should be able to update this section shortly.

By the way, the Super AMOLED screen is GORGEOUS.

Update: The battery life is really amazing on this phone. Even after playing heavy games for long and watching videos with heavy usage, the battery lasts 2 days.

The phone does get heated up little bit after during playing games like PubG &amp; Asphalt 9.

Initially I was happy to get such a good hardware this price. But as soon as I inserted sim problem initiates. Very poor network reception however at the same time other mobiles with same network showed 50 percent better reception. And Amazon is refusing to consider this issue.
As far as display is concerned it is one of the best display available in the market. Rear camera is superb but a bit disappointment is selfie camera. Battery life is good.

Overall if you can afford to compromise with network or in your area if network problem is not there then you can go for this mobile worth at this price

Detailed Review:

Camera: The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots. Additional zoom-out features for both front and rear camera is nice to have.

Battery: I am really happy with battery backup as it lasts up to approx 2 days. Yes, approx 48 hours with medium usage including WiFi and GPS.

Design, Touch, Look &amp; Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light.

The face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock. The processing speed is good enough for heavy games without much heating effect.

Amazon is always great compare to flipkart. Awesome service. Well Samsung M30s is no surprise is a lovely phone packed with all amazing features and monster battery back up. Looks good feels like magic.
The battery is too good, lasted for 4 days for normal usage, 3 days average usage, 2 days on high browsing calling and whatsapping.
Finger print lock is fast..actually is instant fast.

Well, this is another classic example like how our much hyped cinemas/movie do (Flop). I really thought Samsung is doing something to get back in the mid segment market with a quality product, but doesn't look like it. The only positive in this mobile is the battery, but it's too early to comment on it. Camera is not upto the mark, no gorila glass protection and more importantly this has sim detection issue especially Vodafone and idea. Bought this mobile but unable to use it. I would recommend Redmi phones over Samsung.

Received M30s today and really  a great buy . Picture quality is too good . Can update more a week later on the perfomance. Dolby Atmos really rocks . Body build is better than usual SAMSUNG mobile. Perfomance is fine in my 6GB ram variant . Battery backup seems fine , hardly 5% is utilized for normal usage with 24×7 location,4G/ wifi and limited calls .

The battery finally stood for 4 day for my limited use specified above. Overall perfomance is good and acceptable.

Cam is good for day light . Low light is not up to mark.

Fingerprint sensor is good

Probably  the only con about this smartphone is its camera quality, specifically  that of the front camera. The selfies are strictly average, although you can make them work with some basic editing on Snapseed or Lightroom, but they lack detail. The images are soft. Also, there's no support for GCam out of the box, so that makes it worse. But you definitely can make them work, they aren't that bad.
But other than that, this is a really great deal. I've heard people complaining  about creaking noises in the back panel, but personally, I haven't noticed any such thing. I even tried pressing the back panel hard to just see, but it seemed  pretty  solid to me. Apart from that, the battery is obviously  outstanding and so is the display. The UI is smooth and snappy as well, no lag noticed. However, I am not a gamer, so I don't know how would that turn out.
Overall, I think if you can settle in the camera area a bit, it's a great deal, considering you also get Samsung's  excellent  after sales experience and support.

mine is opal black and it look amazing ,
user interface is better than all other phones.
rear camera is good (all you need is good light and steady hand) in low light i would recommend of using flash (it takes more detail),
front camera average in low lighting and good in natural light.
you can play pubg on HD ultra smoothly, and hdr with constant 30+fps.
the more interesting function is AR emojies (must try),
&amp; pubg works excellent after update.
Massive Battery is hard to drain completely.

Never expected this kinda inferior product from the Big brand like Samsung.

Here are pros and cons

Pros:-
1. Screen (at 11.6K price)
2. Battery (6K mAh though will perform like 4K mAh due to software issue I guess coz hardware has 6K capacity)

 Cons :-
1. Camera Sucks
2. Performance Choppy even in normal uses not talking about gaming
3. GPU Sucks very slow performance in the gaming
4. Heating issues while playing games

Wouldn't recommend any one to buy this phone

Review of Samsung M30s (4GB variant ):
I am pretty much sure that many people might have already purchased this device during Amazon festive season like me, later thought of writing review or rating or Checking what others purchaser thinks about this device, or if you are a person who is looking to purchase this device after Amazon festival season or after seeing this review then you have done a good job (even though you might have lost some perks, if any), So, that I can let you know certain things which people obviously miss out in seeing YouTube review videos.
I hope you have time to read my review, So let me confirm to the scope of this review; I am not going speak about camera, display and other common stuffs, as many YouTubers have done good job in those areas and you can check out any video in the YouTube either English or Hindi or regional language of yours, they seems to be good. I personally gone through most of them they are all seems to speak in same aspect,  so, if you consider my suggestion you can check any one of them to know basic info, out of those videos; I thought most informative was Geekranjit and C4tech unboxing video.
Let’s start out Pros and Cons which you may feel informative, I am writing this after using this device exhaustively for 2 days;
Pros;
1. I was afraid to buy Samsung device for the reason that, it comes with bloatware (Think as Useless apps). Thanks to Samsung One UI which has less apps and you can uninstall most of the apps including some of google apps which you don’t use. But be care full while setting up device; ensure you uncheck all unnecessary permission to avoid ads and bloatware. But funny thing is you can’t uninstall Netflix and Facebook, though you can disable them. (Approx. you will be having 12 to 15apps which you can’t disable or uninstall)
2. Out of 4 GB ram you get 1.7 GB ram free and out of 64GB rom you get ~53GB (approx.) free out of box.
3. Samsung one UI is good in ram management (that helps apps running in background and ease access all time you need)
4. If you enable developer option you can see much customization, like;
• Reducing animation (Helps in speeding up device)
• Auto Night mode( which seems to be not working right now but after future updates bug will be fixed)
• Limiting the background process
• Under battery management option you can even set sleeping mode for desired apps.(For instance; I don’t want to see ads from true caller, I use it only to search unknown numbers therefore I put this app under sleep mode so it automatically force stop the app once I am done with my job so that It can’t send me notification)
5. Battery management seems to be good and there is emergency mode to save your battery from draining.
6. With respect to chipset it comes equipped with Exynos 9611 utilizes 10nm processor (Think like lesser nm means better speed and good performance, for instance Oneplus 7 pro utilizes 7nm so it is superfast). I personally compared this chip-set with snapdragon 712 (Used in Realme XT, Realme 5pro, other competitive devices) as per official website spec of these both seems to be same there is no exceptional differences, however as per some website they claim exynos 9611 is better than snapdragon 712 and other claims vice versa(Opposite). I do checked gaming review of both chip-set, both seems to be performing at par, worth to note again that Samsung one UI is boosting a lot this chipset for best performance. However, heating and lag was observed with the same chipset used in Samsung A50s while playing PUBG in high graphics. However, many gamer while playing PUBG on this device has suggested it’s good. (Check out gaming review of Gizmoddict for Samsung A50s {since same chipset} in YouTube for more information)
Cons:
1. Phone warms up little bit while doing multitasking you will be able feel near rare camera. (depends on app you use)
2. Durability seems to be very bad you need to be much careful with this device, I am not going take any chance in it but still you can check out Gupta information system video with respect to durability test of Samsung m30s in YouTube.
3. For some strange reason my songs which are in ogg format are not recognized as songs by music player in this device so I converted my entire song list to mp3 using some third party app.
4. Auto brightness seems to be not adjusting automatically, I don’t know whether it is a bug or due to screen guard and I think in case of bug future updates may fix this bugs.
5. In Samsung official page under support tab, I noticed this model will receive quarterly security updates, which is worth noting.
6. Before making purchase of this device I noticed in some newspaper (I think Indian express) that  this device will receive Android Q update and Samsung is planning to give much support for this new M series device ( Don’t laugh because I noted in con section, since it just reported not guaranteed)
(If you have any doubts about this device or need specific info you can comment or ask in Q&amp;A section I would love to help you out, if I know)

Very good product at an affordable price , for Students it is a MUST, It's best features and lesser price, those who wants to push the limits just go for this phone 200% worth the price.
Use tempered glass and back cover for protection, as the phone doesn't come with Gorilla glass 5 protection and sAMOLED screens are very delicate and costly.
Very much satisfied, thank you amazon.
Thanks for reading ; )

Its my First Purchase of Samsung Galaxy Smartphone, its M30s. Previously used other brands like Motorola, Nokia, Xiaomi, Vivo.

As it was Global Brand, I trusted and Expected more from the Specs advertised or mentioned, But from 1st day of delivery i found it was Defective. Yes Defective Product delivered by Amazon India.

Coming to Device Review :- Only Display sAmoled with Full HD+ was good, and some how The one ui was good.
Battery backup was like 4000 mah only, processor heats a lot up-to 46 degree.
 And consumes more power, power hungry processor, so battery lasts less time.
Product was Feel like cheap because poor build quality, makes back panel and sides crackling sound.
Even One ui having ads, yes but it can be stopped when initial setup of device to not to receive any marketing information unlike Xiaomi.
Cameras also Above Average, front camera is below Average only.
Overall Not expected from Samsung Brand.
For the Display Only I am giving 2 stars, rest was a crap, because of Overheating of Device when Using Normally without Gaming, and Battery drains a lot in idle also.

Everyone knows pros like battery, screen etc etc but there are many cons to
1. Ram available is around 1.5 GB which becomes 800mb without much use
2. Wifi speed is less, I have 50mbps plan and my m30s showing 30mbps whereas  my moto z play showing 48mbps

3. Record time for super slow motion video is 2-3 sec only

4. Camera quality is ok ok only

5. Phones support max 15watt charge only

1. Camera quality is very low, no matter which camera mode you are using, every picture is like clicked by 8MP camera

2. Mobile heating problem - while watching videos, while charging and at the time of the call

3. They don't have return policy, even if you raise request they will do some tests remotely and will tell you that this mobile don't have any issue

Phone is reasonably good at the price 12699rs. display quality is very good. Black color is decent with little green mixed in the corner. Phone could have been little handy in size apart from that back side panel is little cheaper in terms of touch nd feel. But can't blame it bcz of its price point.

First of all I would like to mention the battery life of SAMSUNG GALAXY M30s , it's superb no need of power bank you can use it for one and half day when fully charged . And the SUPER AMOLED display is awesome. The most important thing is the CAMERA quality 48 MP is also superb as it's giving an equal performance when compared to DSLR cameras . Everything in M30s are superb. Mobile is very comfortable while holding, the curves are really nice that's helping to feel comfortable. Over all it's a very nice mobile. And thanks amazon for "GREAT INDIAN SALE".
SUPERB MOBILE.

Camera is a big disappointment in this phone. All other specs are good. If anyone looking for a good camera phone for not buy this.
Samsung being a big player, don't know why they play such cheap tricks by saying camera is 48MP on paper and fooling people by providing a low quality camera in actual.

This phone should have been priced under 10K. Not worth of 14K.

I purchased the mobile on 28th September.
I think Samsung  finally listen to their customers and brought very competetive mobile in its class.
 I have been using the mobile (4GB 64GB) for almost 10 days now. Here are the things i observed

One UI seems lighter and simpler than other UIs like Mi UI, colorOS , I observed no lags so far, i really like one UI.

Good things:
.Super Amoled screen, colors are punchy, viewing angles are great 5/5.
.Back camera 48MP, takes really good pictures,  turn on scene optimizer for even better pictures 4.5/5.
.One UI, simple,  light and fast 5/5.
.Battery, it is huge and Samsung sw optimization make it even better, i am getting SOT of 9hrs to 10hrs 5/5.
.Form factor,  it is great in hand and didn't feel heavy 5/5.
.Sound quality(Dolby atmos) via headphones 5/5.

Not so good things:
.Build quality, it is average, i can hear tiny sound when i touch side of the phone 3/5.
.Front 16Mp camera is very average and takes soft pics like 8mp 3/5.
.Signal reception is also average, you will get 1 bar less signal compared to other phones in competition 3/5.
.Back wide angle camera 8MP, taking images when fish eye effect, hope it can be fixed, 3.5/5.

Techy and gaming things:
.Gaming: i m not a hard core gamer, pubg and wwc2 ran fine better than redmi note 7 pro 4.5/5
.GCAM: camera2api support is limited only, the current gcam ports are not fully working,  hope Samsung enables it, to make us tinker around with gcam ports in future 4/5

My opinion:
If you watch lot of online content like YouTube, Amazon prime etc., and doesn't bother about issues i mentioned above, go for it.
Bugs::

Screen doesn't go off while calling, this is very irritating- bcz Samsung removed proximity sensor-how stupid it is to ruin experience
-----

Pros:
Stellar battery life
AMOLED display
Lightweight design
Competitive cameras

Cons:
Lacks premium finish
15W fast charging is little slow
Low light camera performance still feels lacking

Although for the price this phone is a monster!
Also note that this phone has Android Pie 9.0 out of the box, and i received a software update just after setting up my phone.

1. Battery is getting drain very fast after its reaching 50% Mark. (Unlink 6000 MAH battery should perform).
2. Camera is Okay but not like 48 MP.
3. I am facing internet connectivity issue, Downloading speed is okay but Uploading speed is worst, when i used another device at Same time and same Network, the performance was far better than this pathetic Phone.
4. The phone does not come this any screen protection (for example Gorilla Glass etc), so you need to handle with care.
5.Phone is heavy in weight (what i feel), as weight distribution is not properly done.

Excellent mobile for low cost and advanced features like display quality and great  sound system Dolby atoms. I like very much. Camera quality is also extremely high with this range.  The UI and all the new enhancing animations and icons extremely looking awesome. I can  give  5 out of 5

It is a treat to finally have a phone which is value for money from the house of Samsung. I have used this phone for 3 days as my primary and want to share the following Pros and Cons.

Pros-
1.Excellent set of cameras, 48 megapixel mode is great but the normal 12 mp mode is great too. The wide angle lens is the widest available in the market at this price point.
2.Battery life is exemplary, with moderate usage, a full charge lasts close to 2 days.
3.Processor speed is excellent but not the best in class though. Yet in day to day usage one wouldn't find any problems.
4.Type C port and a 15 watt fast charger provided in the box is a huge plus.
5.Has a triple slot solution allowing for a dedicated micro sd slot with 2 sim slots.
6.The display is to die for. Gorgeous, that is the only word for it, Samsung SUPER AMOLED FHD+.

Cons-

1. Built quality is a downside having a poly carbonate back and no gorilla glass protection. (It has a version of Dragon tail glass though ). Please use a case.
2. For the cameras, the wide angle camera can record videos but Samsung's new implementation Super Steady Mode doesn't work on the wide angle camera. Also, with the super steady mode on, the video quality drops while recording even through the main rear camera. It will be excellent if Samsung can fix this via an OTA upgrade.
3. This point is entirely personal, I did not like the color gradation in this one, the vertical one. Rather would have preferred a mono color back.

Bought on 29th Sept. From day 1 network issue remain try to call several times to Amazon they give such nonsense option for bad network, try to reach seller to buy email can't be reach, I had two phone from RealNetworks and Asus on that both my 4g sims working with full network but with my Samsung m30s it's just show one signal bar...I don't have any hope that amazon or either seller can do this respect whatsoever, I am writing only be to aware that your m30s can give you such kind of trouble.

And please zero star rating for this treatment, but that I can't do, first time given to amazon so sad and utterly disappointed.

While ordering the phone I thought that it would be good even after viewing some of the negative reviews specially about cameras but the phone disappointed me also in more aspects.
First, more than 30% battery drains out within 5 hours without doing any heavy task just upgrading apps and device.
Second,  processor is not up to mark. I played dancing lines and it suffered while running. Earlier I had redmi note 5 pro which ran the game very smoothly.
Third, as in most of the reviews camera quality is not good as specified.

It is first time I made a very bad choice. The specifications are only in papers not in real
life.

I ordered this phone on 28th September since I am a prime member. I recieved it on 29th Morning at 9:30 AM. After setting it up and installing the sim, the error comes, "Sim 1 Not Allowed" and "Sim 2 Not Allowed"  Basically, long story short, no phone calls, texts, or connection to the network services can be made. Amazon technician cannot identify the issue. Samsung Customer Care says this issue only happens when the phone has been "Reported Stolen" and hence the IMEI number has been blocked. Quite shocking for a brand new phone and model which was launched on the 28th of September 2019.

Amazon says "NO REFUNDS" and so I am stuck till they send a technician to figure it out. I would say wait for more reviews before you buy it. ALL THE BEST.

Camera quality is worst. It seems as if you are clicking from a phone with 8MP or 13MP camera. Also, you can easily get the same phone with better features at a very low cost if you will go for any other brand such as MI. Rest, everything seems okay.

I noticed a serious problem as soon as I took the device first in my hand. It feels like the body of this device from the sides(especially from the heights) is loose or something and it makes some creepy sounds when I hold my device firmly as if the back cover fitting is not proper with the body. It also feels like there is a hidden button on the sides as I get "Tap" sound on holding the device.
If you gently press the back of the device against its screen along its perimeter, you can easily see the back, filling the gap in between.
Amazon has scheduled an inspection visit for it at my place in the coming days. I hope that the technician will understand the issue and I will get a replacement for it asap.

Note: Not only me, but many people are facing the same issue.

Want to say that every one is complaining about the camera ....
i want to clear them when u r taking a pic first u have to change the setting in to 48 mp.
After that u have to tauch the screen for better focusing... then u will see the dslr.
I unloaded some pic which are clicked by 48mp.. which are 22 mp and some are bigger than it.
yes i agree that the selfi camera should be more consistent.....
But make sure u are clicking the pic in proper natural lighting conditions...
then u will see the change.
other wise the camera normally takes 12 mp photo.
other features are awesome
specially battery and the screen
ram manage ment..
sore are complaining about the avaible ram
is just 1.2
Let me clear that i aslo get surprised to see 1.3 avaible ram
But after that installed 5o more application ..
out of which some are larger and some are smaller in size like tiktok, insta,face book...
but still surprisingly still 1.2 gb was available in ram...
So don't worry about that...
Just go for this mobile..
Go#monster......
 And feed in ur mind that sar value... also matter....... which we found muchlesser than any device....

I am using this phone from 1 week.

Camera is okay, Buttery works for more than a day.

This mobile inbuilt Samsung Note app don't have "Pin to home screen" option, I confirmed that from the Service Center.

People who need productivity by using Note can't use this mobile.

PLEASE NOTE: Amazon Only Provide Replacement. NO RETURN! &amp; REFUND!

Budget phone if you don't use Samsung Note App.

I will update the rating to 5 star if Samsung resolve this issue.

Only good thing is battery backup

Not much difference in build over Samsung Galaxy M30 except for back color. Screen looks brighter compared to M30 and most of the other mobiles in this price range.
Even the processing speed has improved I felt. There was no lag even after opening 8 applications. Not many unnecessary apps like in other android mobiles.

Battery:
USP to sell this mobile
One heck of a beast. Used for entire night and battery dropped by only 9% which is great
Did not observe any heating issues (though it's quite early to judge)

Camera:
Like almost any mobile, works really well in good light
Sometimes you get a doubt if it's really 48MP, otherwise pictures are good
New functions specially slow motion and super slow motion are cherry on the cake

Overall verdict:
Worth buying specially if you're someone who is on mobile all the time. Buy it before the price increases.

Update- the USP of this phone is battery, but I see that it started to drain really quick.

I was looking 4 main things in my new mobile which was display , battery backup , easy interface and sound output.  And in all these  category Samsung M30S is exceptional well.
Pros.
1. Display is so rich and crystal clear
2. 6000 mah true monster as states
3. In build cleanup and mobile optimizing options
4. Dolby Atmos for ear phones was cherry on cake.
Cons.
Audio Jack should have been on top of mobile and additional speakers with more dept would be great.
Finger censor should have been on the screen

1. The battery is humongous. it's 6000 Mah. It will last for at least 2 days for normal use. For extensive use like 12 hrs of video stream then it will last at least 24-30 hours.
2. It comes with a 15W type-c charger. It goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours.
3. It gets an upgrade in the form of the octa-core Exynos 9611 SoC whereas M30 uses Exynos 7809 SoC.
4. Exynos 9611 SoC comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.
5. It comes with Android 9.0 Pie which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.
6. The camera can capture 4K videos too but without stabilization.
7. It has an impressive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with minimal bezels.
8. It has polycarbonate back which isn’t as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.
9. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).
10. With 4 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far.
11. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).
12. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.

Cons:

Con's:

1. The camera is just good on paper. The device lets you capture 48MP shots, but you wouldn’t notice a world of difference between regular 12MP images and this one. Absolute no details at all.
2. Night mode isn’t the best.
3. Selfie shooter could’ve been better i.e. selfies are good, but they can’t compete with rivals
4. No display protection (I mean screen guard here).
5. It sports a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M30s is decent but not rich enough.
6. It doesn't come with earphones.
7. Some bloatware are preinstalled &amp; you do get unnecessary notifications from the MyGalaxy. Why Samsung need this?

I purchased this at Rs 12,600 during Amazon sale and in addition, I got 1-year screen damage protection as well. I am fine with this phone at this price point.

Extremely disappointed in the camera.  Doesn't meet expectations. Primary or selfie camera took photos like 5mp. M30s not meet the basic requirements of camera  expectations. 48 mp is just for namesake
Other stuff  battery, screen and speed are looks good

Product is good and fast charging  is also good, but slippery and phone is little bit heat during first update. Camera, voice quality and speaker are all good. And battery is good, played pubg under high graphics for 1 hour and only 5% was reduced...

The camera is awful. It's not 48 mp it's  16 mp. The back is plastic and gets heated easily. I bought this after checking the reviews but honestly it's not worth the price. It's only good on advertisements not in actual.

Body is plastic makes noise wen pressure is applied.
Network issue. Call drop issue.
Mobile get heated after normal surfing. You can't talk for long as it is heated.

saw about the JIO offer declared in the product selling page of Amazon.in ( https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-631/dp/B07HGJ7WM6 ) under " Jio Galaxy Club Offer Here's how ". Hence I bought the new Samsung M30s Mobile phone and for claiming this offer, I bought a new Jio Sim and recharged activation for Rs. 398 with being first recharge Rs. 299 on the Samsung M30s. But when even after 48 hours, I didn't got the double data vouchers, I inquired with Jio Customer Care, and they clearly mentioned that "Currently they are not running any offers for Samsung M30s but only for Samsung M30 mobile. Hence I won't be getting any vouchers.". I also contacted amazon customer care about this, and they claim that they will look into the issue, but they are not ready to file a complaint no as well.

Purchased on first sale..for 11600 rs(1400 rs bank discount+1000 rs amazon pay).. Received within 2 days..
Mobile is good..i was a redmi note 5 pro user..but i needed the bigger battery that's why i chose Samsung M30S..let me include some Pros &amp; cons .so u can make a choice before buying it..
Pros- 1)S-AMOLED display(thats amazing from Samsung)
2) front and back cameras are also very good..
3)lighr weight (for the 6000 mAh battery)
Cons-
1)bateery is not performing like 6000 mAh.its same like 4000 mAh of my redmi note 5 pro..
2)fingerPrint scenner is worst..means worst..if u swipe your finger the it will not recognize u..u have to put the finger on scanner without moving it..and it takes about  1 second to open..
3)face unlock is also worst..it didnt recognize properly..even if i close my eyes it will still recognize me..thats the security threat to user..means others can open if u r sleeping.
4) Network Reception is also worst..gives around 50% less network as compare to note 5 pro..
5)and the last..the samsung inherited the Hanging problem from the ages..thats also continue in Samsung M30s.
The main problem is network issue..SAR value is too low..
The internet speed will give u headache..
Go for Realme 5 pro,realme xt,redmi note 7 pro,oppo f11 pro..

Not working. Waste my amount and time. First day itself not working. Total failure. I could not switch on mobile even after 12 hrs. Completely dead phone you have given. I want to return it immediately. Brand new mobile Samsung M 30 S is stopped working within 2 minutes. When applied for replacement, they are telling no time slot for inspection. Nobody is there to listion our cry. After four days they supplied new phone.
  Again I am writing this review after two &amp; half month's use. It stopped charging. I  have given my mobile to an authorised service centre at THRISSUR.  Now they are asking Rs.4500 for repair.  They are telling its display and charging socket have damaged. Within two &amp; half months use brand new samsung mobile phone has become waste. I have lost entire money.

Yesterday I purchased this phone mainly because of massive battery (6000 mH) and to get stock android experience. For the last 5 years, I was using redmi phone (all in my house).  Then I thought to change to another; shortlisted realme and samsung.  After one day (14 hours ) use, I found the phone is HEATING HEATING HEATING so much and battery dropped from 100 to 78 after recording video for say 45 minutes. ( I was expecting 2 days battery). If I am cool and keep the phone without any job, it remains cool.  Out  of 64 GB,17.4 gb is used by system/user data (user data is only 270 MB), 2.7GB is used for application. When no application is running in front/back, 2.3GB memory is used up.  Then what is stock android - all memory and storage is swallowed up.  If you select vibration, no ringtone (either one ). Not possible to set vibration for touch effect.  No vibration is possible on call connect. Very difficult to take  screen shot(still could not).  The screen and phone is slippery. Touch response is bad (I may adapt to) . Finger scanner is not much responsive ( I may adapt).  I am little disappointed because of my expectations. Still I will keep the phone hoping for some method I would find out for the problems.

The Samsung Galaxy M30s is a fantastic flagship to the Galaxy M series. It is priced well and offers some really good features including a Super AMOLED display and a 5000 mAh battery ,&amp; super 48 megapixel Camera.

Value for Money.

Superb  Camera, Battery  life.

Samsung Galaxy M30 is a compelling device, and if you are considering buying it, the decision of buying it will be a good one.

6000 mah battery got to charge it twice a day on a average usage and it takes 3+ hours on fast charging
to charge. My previous Nokia 6.1+ phone with 3000 mah  lasts  same.

Camera quality is average don't feel like 48 mp .

Only super amoled screen and fingerprint reader is better.

I guess there is some issue with the battery. It can't drain so fast have applied for replacement

Very must dissappointed with this mbl.
Please dont buy it, you will get disappointed asu dont have return option
Coming to camera ,48 mp is just number it is worse than 8 mp.
Battery is also not that great
Touch response is very slow
Facing network issue
Finger sensor is also slow
Very delicate..should handle carefully
Amazon and samsung are just playing cheap marketing strategy saying 48mp and 6000mah...it is equal to 8mp and 3500 mah..
Go for redmi note 7 pro..

Samsung m30s is a nice mobile phone at this price range compare to other brands.
The triple rear camera looks good and the camera quality is also good, the front camera is 16mp which is good for taking selfy and the video quality is also good, night mode is also good captures good photos at low lights.
The product which I brought was 4gb and 64gb which was a mid-range mobile phone with this specification,the display of the phone is big looks good while using the phone.
The fingerprint sensor works fast takes microseconds to unlock your phone and also the face lock also works fast to unlock your phone.
The battery is 6000mAh which is pretty good at this price range which gives a long battery back up for your phone and also the Type-C charging is provided which allows for fast charging.
The game booster is also provided which allows good gaming experience, gorilla glass 3 is provided which enhances the look of the phone.

Main issues are below
1) Heating while playing video and 2 min of voice call.
2) Battery is 6000 mah and  they are claiming that fast charging. But it will take minimum 2.5 to 3 hrs for full charge.
3) No need to use apps , automatically mobile will discharge and heats automatically. I am moderate user , I am not playing games but battery hardly 1 day life I am getting. Which was I got in my 3700 mah pervious mobile.
4) Front camera is worst. Not 16 MP may be 5 mb.

Other things are okay.

Don't believe in ratings. My friend also facing same problems.

I have been using this phone since last 1 month and I was one of them to get it 1st during presale days in September 28th..

I had very tough decision to choose between Real me XT n M30s

I am not sure how good XT be with 64 MP camera but i can definitely say that do not buy this phone if your top most priority is camera

Day shots are good but not up too the mark.. I have tried their all modes

Night shot are useless.. Just attaching few which I have recently taken..

Battery is indeed great..

Amazon Customer Care. Samsung M30 Go Monster is really sleek &amp; good. Battery life is extended upto 6000mAh. Which is correct.
What is missing a detailed user manual which one needs to down load from the net. The other missing item is head phone &amp;mic since it is purchased online. Has three cameras. One for selfie and two rear cameras. Battery is very powerful 6000maH. Long duration. No need to charge frequently. Once charged to fully or 100%. It lasts for three full days.The picture quality is extremely good with two rear or back cameras.
Better security in terms of fingerprints and facial recognition with lock screen. I am quite satisfied in all ways with the performance of Samsung Galaxy M30 in the last two months after purchase from Amazon online.
It has given a full value for my money.  N. Srinivasan

The worst 48mp camera ever. And the build quality also is poor. Not expected this from Samsung.
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars

Like:
1. My battery lasts at 40-48 hours without even activating any power saving mode.
2. The camera is absolutely brilliant... the live focus and wide lens captures the miracle.
3. The RAM never stops you from multitasking,  neither does the processor.
4. The camera doesn't pop out of the back panel. So you can easily keep your phone on a plane surface and use.

Dislike:
1. My iPhone used to keep the audio either in earphones or phone depending on from where you receive the call. But, samsung puts it in audio accessories by default.. which makes you switch every time you receive a call while listening to music.

I bought this phone during launch because of the battery hype, the display and camera. It is a normal battery, l wonder what 6000mah performance means to Samsung? I have a LG V30 plus with a 3500mah battery which gives quite good performance compared to my Samsung M30s taking into consideration the much smaller battery. The display is good but not extra ordinary. The camera too is good but not extraordinary.
Anyway considering the price all this is ok.
What I really hate about the phone is, that even though you have paid for the product, it seems Samsung still feels they own you. Even for using a basic feature like the gallery, one has to give up to Samsung all of one's privacy rights. LG, Lenovo etc. do not demand that. I am well aware that the minute one buys a smartphone, there is no privacy anymore, but still to go to the extent of how much Samsung wants to own the user experience, and invade their privacy blatantly is disgusting. Why would anyone want to buy any phone and still face hurdles using it? Digital slavery with new meaning, you pay to become a slave...

Amezing product by samsung. Samsung did briliant by removing hybrid slot and making dedicated slot for 2 sims and 1 micro sd card. Thanks to amazon for delivering it in less than 16 hours. After unboxing, first look and 2 hours of usage, extremely satisfied. Triple camera with 48 mega pixel is just icing on cake.

Nice phone to start with. Battery backup is really great. Phone looks good, performance not bad for a 6gb RAM variant.

Everything in Short...
Only Battery, Display and Processor is improved nothing else, so don't expect much from this...

Display is superAMOLED
Immersive Experience from display...
Graphic Quality is much better in sAMOLED then IPS LED or TFT..

Battery is 6000mAh
Normal Use 2Days Backup
Pubg 7hr, COD 9hr, Freefire 9hr

Processor Exynos 9611
Not Powerful than 710 or 712 but good enough for playing Games, not good for High end games...

Camera
Just Bez of camera I deducted 1star...
Not good at all, unsatisfied with camera..

so my opinion....
Overall good phone but Z1x is better choice...

1)Camera and built quality is not good as Mi note7 pro is better. No any back cover or screen protection glass received. Other oppo vivo mobile phone gets.
2)I faced issue "mm phone service sim not allowed" to both slot but now resolved after suffering 2 day's.
3) 10 days return is not allowed, Only replacement if Amazon executive allowed.
4) I feel E-commerce business is only for dumping some of defective items in India due to improper govt policies of consumers protection processes.
5) Don't purchase high value products on e-commerce like electronics appliances.
6) I got mobile broken original box sticker and packed with other sticker on same sticker.

Such a waste product... I got it just one month back... It fell down from. Knee level height and a the panel got broken... And the worst part is it costs ₹5000 and the samsung customer service was not at all nice....we asked how come it break just from knee level height and know what they replied... That thier brand phones will break at whatever height we put from so it is our risk to get from them... We got very annoyed after hearing this.... Samsung you are going to go down again.... Worst product and worst customer service

In my experience with this mobile is not good one..
This mobile battery not fully charged to 100% since purchased newly and overheating  issue error comes and same proved with "smart chk" application. This will put myself carrying dangerously overheated battery  and 6000mah battery illusion..
Now replacement offered and its takes another two days to receive..already I lost money on purchased screen protector and next three days without  mobile since old one exchanged.
Request amazon to consider fair compensation for purchasing  faulty product and subsequent delay in replacement...

I bought this phone on sept 28th and recieved it on 29th morning.After spending sometime with the device following are my observations:

PROS:
1.The Super Amoled full HD+ display is super bright and has rich colors.Best in this price segment.The display is protected by dragon tail glass and not gorilla glass.Dragon tail is durable and provides enough protection against scratches and drops from small hieghts.Its better to put on a tempered glass for additional safety.
2.The audio output via headphone jack/bluetooth is top notch.This device has Dolby Atmos support using headphones only.
3.The Mammoth 6000mah battery is a true power house.The device can easily last 2days with moderate to heavy usage.
4.Although the 48mp main camera is a samsung sensor instead of sony,samsung has done fantastic software optimizations to capture stunning shots.The camera is one of the best in its segment.The super steady video mode which is found in flagship phones is included with this device and works brilliantly.
5.Samsung one UI OS is extremely stable.Fast response and fluid animations.Comes with android pie out of the box.The ram management is excellent better than its competition.
6.15 Watt fast charger included in the box.The device takes around 2hours 30 mins for a full charge from 0 to 100%.It seems a bit slow but considering the battery capacity it is decent.
7.Mobile comes with triple slot.You can install 2 sims and a micro SD card simultaneously.

CONS:
1.The back cover and finger print scanner are made of polycarbonate plastic and are prone to scratches with everyday use.
2.The speaker output is very low and sound quality is average.It is a mono speaker.
3.Physical Notification LED light is not present.It has Always on display feature for notifications.
4.The mobile doesnt come with any preapplied screen protector or case with in the box.Better order them along with the mobile.
5.Front camera performance is average even though it is 16MP resolution.
6. The gaming performance is decent.Althought with extended gaming for 15-20 mins the device heats up to 42-43°C while playing heavy games like PuBG in high settings.Changing the graphics to medium settings reduces the temperature by 4-5°C.

Verdict:
All in all it is a surprise to see samsung targeting the budget segment aggressively.Considering the Specs and the price this is a must buy device for people looking for a bigger battery,media consumption,casual gaming and normal photography.

Camera quality -3rd class...I'll suggest the manufacturer dont give camera.
Battery life-also not good charged 84% at 9am and at 1pm it was 58%
I bought  two mobile redmi 7 and Samsung m30s.....Redmi 7 is far better than m30s.
This mobile  price should  be around 7 to 8k.
14 k is too much.Samsung will lost their name if they start thinking about business they should focus on customer satisfaction and not on money.MI and realme mobiles are true winners if I compare  this mobile with them.
They really  focus on price range and quality of the mobile.

My honest opinion is "This phone is amazing for the price I paid." yes there are other phones out there in similar or higher specs for the same price range but the sAMOLED screen with 1080p resolution is no match. Plus the software is super smooth in the last two days of usage, I found no lag or slowness. I bought this during the sale and installed all the apps that I use regularly. Played these games without any trouble or lag, like PUBG and Call of duty, which is another big plus.
Obviously there are some downsides, camera is not great and it auto glorifies the photo in a non realistic way but I believe it can be turned off or may be updated by software upgrades. The phone is a little heavy but I know this when I bought it as it has 6000mah batteries (what should I expect?).
Anyways there are loads of positive things than couple of negatives which I am happy to accept (remember I spent ~11700). Nevertheless this is an over 5 star phone for the price.
Pros:
sAMOLED screen with 1080p - 5+⭐
11nm super fast speedy processor - 5+⭐
Samsung one UI software - 4.5 ⭐
Fast charging with 15w - 4.5 ⭐
Lightweight with 6000mAh battery - 4.5 ⭐
Finger print reading and location - 4⭐
Price of the phone - 5⭐

Cons:
Camera quality (does not look like 48MP, more like 12MP &amp; upscaled) - 3 ⭐
Camera app or software - 3 ⭐
Monster battery lasts 1 day only (maybe a little over) with regular usage - 3⭐
Is it gorilla glass? Maybe not - 3.5⭐

Camera quality is below average. 48 MP feels like 8 MP photos.

First of all let me tell you this is one of the best mobile in this price segment. I m loving it a lot.
Pros-
1.Super AMOLED display looks so attractive and provides great experience while watching videos and playing games.
2.This phone is totally Lag Free...exynos 9611 is very powerful processor making the whole system more smooth...Also remember SAMSUNG one Ui is the best os among all.I m using 6gb variant..the ram management is  tremendous helping me a lot in doing multi tasking programmes.
3.Talking about the camera...every portraits and night mode pics are looking fabulous with highly enhanced quality.Selfie is also very good...It is also capturing awesome pics just like the rear camera.Video stability is great and its super slow motion is killer one.
4.Fingerprint and face unlock is as fast as the light..Just give only slight touch to its fingerprint reader...it unlocks in even less than half milliseconds.
5.This phone is really a true MONSTER...I m a moderate user then also it is providing complete 2 day battery life...really SAMSUNG M30s' battery is great with its beast 6000mah(Go MONSTER) in the mobile industry.
6.Game booster is also helping me very much in playing PUBG.
Cons-
This is the first ever phone in which I think there is no cons.
Conclusion: Remember u r not only getting phone with awesome features in this price range but u are getting a BRAND VALUE of SAMSUNG too which is the best company in the world.
Thank you SAMSUNG for providing these thrilling specifications and also I want to thanks AMAZON for its Super fast Delivery.
I love SAMSUNG.

I have ordered this device the moment it was released. The back panel seems to be of very poor build quality. When you hold the device for browsing, the sides of the back panel makes quirky noises. This is bcz of bad build quality of the back panel. I have requested for a replacement, n upon inspection, the inspection agent has confirmed that devices for this model are facing this as a common issue. I was recommended to visit the Samsung service center for buying a brand new phone. Please do not order this model since Amazon may not be able to refund and can only replace a defective product again.

I personally loved it. System UI is best. And samsung display is best as usual. You can play games at high graphics. I played pubg mobile on HD graphics there was not a little lag till now.
Camera is just pretty Awesome.
Battery - it takes little more time to charge but it lasts long as well. I charged full once and its second day it's still 70.
Of course one can't compare this phone with same specification of S series because their price is high as well.
Just there was one thing I didn't like that's I installed my all needed apps around 14 including games and it shows only 1 GB memory available out of 4.
Best in this price from Samsung.
I got it in 11,699 /-

First Of all Thanks To Samsung India For Competing with Other Chinese Brands
Ordered This Monster Yesterday And Got It Today... Such A Nice Opal Black Colour, It looks So Satisfying.
It was a Jaw Dropping Deal For me
It Has Got 6000 Mah Battery..So just Go for it blindly.
It has Got 6.4" sAmoled FHD+ Display which is just amazing at this price range
IT has got Type C Fast Charging And A Dedicated Sim Slot..
I would have been Even more happier if it had a Gorilla Glass and A Metal/Glass Back.
The Processor is just Marvellous and The Camera Is Also Acceptable at this Price Point..
Thought of buying Realme XT/5 Pro
But reverted myself because of this Battery Specification...
At Last Just Go For it Blindly Without thinking of Any Other Phone Brands, Because No one Will Provide such a Amazing Stuff At this Price Point..
I Checked On 12 October This Phone Comes with a Exynos 9610 Processor...Shame on Samsung for this Fake Description

I never expected for this Samsung brand company thus also chits for selling.

It's look dark white original other all show full white.  Many more reason I have I don't expected Samsung brand Company chits has

Totally waste of money, very bad item, camera is poor, not more than 5 mp, battery not more than 2000mAH,hate Samsung because this type of bad mobile launching, if your budget under 17k you may go with Nokia or LG mobile and also other brand, its price should be under 8k,phone looks very poor,3gb of ram always stay engaged, you got only 3gb free memory. Hate hate m30s,

Amazing phone. Opal black looks great in real than in picture.
With Deal and cash back, this phone cost only Rs.11600.
Best thing about this phone is dual sim and a separate slot for memory card. So you don't have to go for 128 gb model if you are looking for storage memory.
Only think it lacks is the notification led.
Regarding phone performance, will post after 1 week.

I tried to charge other phones with that charger but no luck. But I can charge this new phone with my old charger. Now I am not sure if I should replace the phone or should go to Samsung service center.

Worst build quality. If I press my phone back panel tick tick sound is coming.  Cheap quality phone. Pls don't buy, or else u will regret. Phone is heating  in normal usage itself.  Front side top area gets heated up very fast for normal  browsing and seeing movie. Better to go with redmi or realme phones. Wasted my money by buying this phone.

3.Battery is good, but they have given very slow charger I feel like I am charging my power bank not the phone.
4.Built quality is very poor.
Back side plastic is very poor
And my piece is slighty bened at finger print sensor area.
5. Navigation issue, current locations not shows in Google maps.
Its better to buy realme or redmi on same price range.

Unbiased review after usage of 4 days .Will update the review after one month .

Review.
Too much hyped phone , Lots of marketing has been done for this phone in youtube .The quality is not expected from Samsung .The first disappointment is the earpiece sound volume ( very low while receiving calls)  .The back cam is not upto the mark .

Cons
1) Rear (back) Camera not good .Low light and
  medium light results in too much grains .
  Absolutely not 48 mp samsung quality
  camera. Looks good in paper but bad in
  reality .

2) Earpiece volume(during receiving calls) is very
  very low .(Not recommended for mid aged
  people). If you are planning to gift it to your
  parents then do proper research .(Not
  recommended from my side)

Satisfied things on this mobile .
 1) External speaker volume is okay
 2) Samsung One UI is okay expect the voice
  assistant (Dont not activate it ,phone becomes
  very slow)
 3) Front cam is good during video calls
  (Duo,whatsapp)
4) Selfie is fine but looks artificial .

Pros
1) Screen is good .Very bright display at this price range .
2) Battery is good .It has a good backup .
3) Looks wise the phone is neat and handy.

Final Verdict
This is just a budget range phone like other chinese companies with good amoled display  ,definitely NOT A SAMSUNG QUALITY MOBILE PHONE.

Cons
1. Phone's upper 10% portion (from where we touch our ear) is heating up even after 2 minutes call and pain is happening in ear. this is harmful for human body
2. Basic functionality calling is not working properly so it's wastage of time and money both
3. it is better to buy other Chinese company phone rather than trusting on SAMSUNG Brand, Samsung is launching waste product to decrease it's rapo
4.  Fast charging is also not working, full charging is taking 3-3.5 hour.
5. Big mistake of samsung, samsung will lose its customer by providing this kind of product

Ordered yesterday as soon as it was up for sale, received delivery today. Yet to use the phone but looks decent.

However, there is no screen protector, back cover with it. And the packaging is below par. Definitely not something one expects from Samsung. Now the hunt is on for screen protector and back cover.

within 10 days, i have more issue, battery drains faster, overheating within min after camera is launched, there is no display when i get a call, i have to wait for 2 rings and then i am can see the display, it show the caller ID(who is calling me), amazon customer service and escalation team is pathetic, technician who came to my place to check the camera is not aware of what the issue is. and escalation team say they are certified tech,
i brought this mobile looking at the reviews. as i am not a gamer i wanted to go for Samsung m30s, i am super disappointed with camera picture , rear camera is ok, however from front camera one of the worst, i have moto mobile 8mp which give a very good picture, better than Samsung, i have adjusted all the setting i can and still no luck, amazon had refused to refund my money as it has only replacement,  i dont have a choice, i have to live with it. i would like to add few point regarding price, 1300 cashback on sbi card, 500 cash back from amazon, so this are the figures 12999-500-1300 =11199, i took it in EMI another approx 500 discount. i would honestly recommend you guys to go for redmi note 8 pro, a 1000 extra you get a better one, 6gb ram and 64mp, 4 rear cameras. please dont do the same mistake which i did.

Build Quality Of This Phone Is Bad .. I Mean You Can Simply Feel The Cheap Build Quality Of This Phone .... So My Suggestion Is Whenever U Buy This Phone Also Buy Good Tempered Glass And Good Back Cover At That Time ...!! For Me This Phone Is Good For Entertainment Not For Gamers ... If Your A Pubg Lover Then Please Never Ever Think To Buy This Phone ...!!

This is pathetic. They are showing big things but lack basic security function. You dont have app lock function in m series. Not acceptable. Its not that hard to add basic functions in 17000 phone. I think i will find more such things absent. No touch lock function, no media hide option.

BOUGHT IT JUST FOR THAT BATTERY!

* Battery life is pretty sweet so far. Goes more than a day with well above 6 hours of screen on time!
* Screen is amazing
* Performance is good. Haven't observed any lag so far.
* Camera is mediocre, rear camera takes decent pictures. But pro options are limited to ISO, white balance and exposure.
* Selfies are okay-ish. Blur effect is decent.

Hi all this mobile is getting heated very quickly when i talking or installing apps or using internet, this mobile is not up to the mark based on SAMSUNG brand name i buy this mobile. Dont buy based on cost or brand name,full charge takes above 2 hrs to full and gets dry very quickly if you enable always on display. i tried to return this product but amazon is saying only exchange or replace is there. I am very much disappointed. The fingerprint sensor also takes more time to unlock.

Review After 12 hours of use!
(6 GB 128 GB Opal Black)

Pros:
1. Elegant Design. Looks like a premium  category phone. (5/5)
2. Battery backup is just great. It only reduced by 20% in non stop use of 4 hours. (5/5)
3. Speed is great. Running very fast and smooth. Apps opening within 1-2 seconds.  Enjoyed playing high end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9 without any issues. (5/5)
4. No heating issues. (5/5)
5. Sound quality  is good. (5/5)

Cons:
1. Both Cameras are poor. Nothing like 48 MP. Front camera is also not good as expected. (2/5)
2. Though it provides fast charging, Battery charging time is very high. Took almost 2.5 hours in 50-55% charging. (3/5)

Overall - (4/5)

Phone is great. Writing this review after using this phone for 3 days.
1. Camera is good not excellent, 48 MP not upto the mark.
2. Display is awesome. I like the Night mode.
3. Opal black color looks little odd for me when compared to other colors, better it would be full black thats what I felt.
4. Battery backup also good. 6000mAh not that much weight.
5. Sim tray quality is low.
6. Fast charging is good but Charger looks some kind of OK.
7. Fingerprint sensor detecting little bit slow. Ok for me. Feeling difficult to find the fingerprint sensor in the back.

Overall, if you are looking for mid range phone with good battery, go ahead and buy it.

Very disappointed with this Samsung M30S. Mainly purchase because of brand Samsung and 48 mexa pixel camera. But camera is very poor and the image look like  as it is 5 mexa pixel.  Samsung is doing fraud by misleading public by advertising it as 48 mexa pixel. Totally waste of money.

So far it has been excellent  on every front whether it is battery,  camera or fingerprint reader. I am giving it overall one star less because of its Dolby atmos feature being less optimised in this device. It should have been a bit louder. This is my personal opinion which others may  find ok. Otherwise this is the best budget segment phone from the Samsung as yet. Commendable job!

Pro...
1. Display is very good. Awsome.
2. OS is friendly.
3. Performance is as of now good for average usage.
4. A very well try from Samsung, but needs a whole lot of improvement if they want to dominate the mid range segment.

Cons...
1. Camera .... Totally wasted. If u love mobile photography ... Plz dont buy this phone.
2. Heating issue during photography and gaming.
3. GPU is not upto the mark as compared to Adreno series.
4. Build quality... Dose not feel like a mid range premium phone. Chinese makers are far ahead in this or below this price range.
5. Hd fon audio o/p and normal speaker o/p has been compromised.
6. Gaming experience is poor as compared to SD processors within this price range.
7. The battery backup has been over hyped.
8. Some one ... In the name of Samsung India, here in Amazon Q&amp;A section, was claiming the front glass was CG 3, but latter found it is dragon tail glass, nowhere in the competition. Amazon, plz take care of this matter. Don't fool the customers.

Verdict ...
Go for any chinese manufacturers within this price range having SD cheapest...

Good  one.... My suggestion  better  A series.  A50.....

Bad quality  Rear Camera &amp; mobile Over Hitting Normal use .

1. Charging : full charge in 2 hours 35 minutes or more, sometimes 1% in 3 minutes, charger and phone both heating
2. The battery back up : less than a 4000 mah battery, not acting like a 6000 mah battery phone, keeping screenlight 15% okay otherwise battery-draining
3. Camera images : image quality no way 48 mega pixel, Change in colour, blurry images on zoom, difference in colour when in wide-angle view, selfie images not up to the mark
4. Camera videos : video recording nice, better than capturing images.
5. Display : nice, great experience while watching YouTube videos
6. Processor : fast and nice
7. Screentouch : very comfortable and smooth
8. Network speed : nice, lack of network-speed meter
9. Sound : volume enough for use, lack of bass quality
10. Sound recording : very nice, no noise found in recording
11. Build quality : very nice, back panel in opal-black colour charming, required back-cover protection, feeling good in hand
12. Network : good

I wanted this phone only because of its monster battery-capacity, I find myself not satisfied at all. I don't know why the battery is not up to the mark. I can't say if there is any difference in the battery back-ups of this phone's 4GB ram &amp; 6GB ram versions. I hope my honest and unbiased review will help customers here, Amazon India and Samsung for their further actions. Thank you!

First of all, don't buy phones from Amazon as they have very poor after sales support and return policy (here no one understands your problem after they sell their products

Coming to this phone,
It only looks good with features listed...
But camera quality - pathetic (close to 5 mp camera)
Screen- worst (u get better screen quality in 8k phones)
Touch response is very slow
Speakers are defective (may in my case only)
Signal strength is very poor compared to my previous MOTO phone
...on top of this misery, u have pathic customer support from Amazon...
I had checked my phone thru their Smartchek App...and it failed in 2 parameters (camera and signal)
Even after that they did not accept the return/replacement and arraged technician visit...and this visit is getting auto rescheduled evry time without my knowledge...
Now return window is over...
By Now you would have understood...how Amazon is using this tricks to avoid return or replacement..!!!!

I had bought this mobile with great expectation as claimed by Samsung in their specification sheet and product description, but unfortunately device is fairly disappointing at every single aspect.

I have already requested to return the product.
Got call from Amazon that their expert will come and inspect the device.
He came and checked, now waiting for next step from Amazon

Don't expect such quality product at price of 17000 INR.
There are much better options available in the market at this price.
Before purchase of this mobile I was using Redmi Note 5 pro, which was much cheaper and was launched in 3-4 years back and with not so much hyped specifications. Even performance of my old mobile was far better as compared to this 2019 product of Samsung.

Camera:  Extremely poor.
Samsung says it has main camera (Auto Focus) 48.0 MP + 8.0 MP + 5.0 MP and front camera 16.0 MP.
No way it clicks 48 MP photos, not even 8 MP, front camera is also disappointing against 16MP .
No sharpness, completely blur, dusty/foggy photos, no clarity and out of focus photos and video.
Don't expect even a decent photo in low light.

*Mainly when making a video call (WhatsApp etc), if you switch to main/rear camera then called party gets video quality like 5 MP camera or like webcam which we were using 5-10 years back. It is blur, dusty, out of focus, freezing video (not that wifi used was very decent). Sometimes it works normal as well but rarely.

Don't know if it is hardware problem or software but it is there for sure.
In reviews I found some people already facing issue like I am facing with camera, same observation, same results.
In reviews I found some people praising its camera but may be it is problem with some lot of manufacturing.
But mine is having serious issues definitely.

Touch: Poor
Sometimes even not able to answer the call, rest you can imagine.

*Battery: Samsung says it has 6000 MAH and mentions on its website like below

  Internet Usage Time(LTE) (Hours)
  Up to 22
  Internet Usage Time(Wi-Fi) (Hours)
  Up to 22
  Video Playback Time (Hours)
  Up to 29
  Audio Playback Time (Hours)
  Up to 131
  Talk Time (4G LTE) (Hours)
  Up to 49

So if I do not play games, don't watch movies or web-series on mobile, dont use GPS for navigation, do not spent more than 2 hour avg on internet, below average use of social media apps, screen wake time is also minimal, don't get too many calls and don't talk for hours on mobile, .....in short a normal human which has life beyond mobile as well... how much back up should I expect? 2.5 to 3 days I guess, if it is fair. Considering that my old mobile was having 4000 MAH and was providing me beyond 1.5 day backup

Believe me that is not the case, I am getting hardly 1 and sometimes 1.5 day backup.

*Charging is taking around 2.5 hours or more.

Summary: Poor, Disappointing, not worth, only exaggerated specifications on paper. Camera,Battery,Touch: POOR

 Battery life very poor and it's not coming 24 hrs as standy mode or using mode. Hardly I am using calling purpose and WhatsApp purpose.  Not more than that

Good things in M30S:
1. Good display
2.Battery backup upto 1.5 days atmost
3. Face recognition very fast
4.Camera good one(not the best, but slow and super
slow motion is very best)
5.Fast Charging atmost 2.15hrs (from 0 to 100)

Disappointment in M30S:

1.No Knox security, Securefolder And Samsung Mall
(Which are unique Samsung apps)
2.NFC not available and also no Samsung Pay
3.No SBike mode
4.Plastic back case is little disappointing
5.No backcase with the box

But overall it is satisfied. You can buy at discount.
I bought it for Rs. 15300 (10%off with SBI Credit Card)

Mine is opal black
I got this phone at amazing price on first sale. Actual price 14000, sbi instant discount 1400 and 1000 cashback on Amazon pay balance, so i got this product for rs 11600/- which is absolutely amazing.
But I didn't like the camera quality as they claim it has 48mp and Also super slow-motion get flicker.
Nowadays most of the phones company works on there design to make it attractive but this phone didn't look attractive at all.
But the best thing is we are getting 6000mh battery and Samoled display at this price range is good and also having 6000mh battery the phone is very light weight. But at rs 11600 it is awesome.

Front Camera is not that much good.. having heating issues around the camera area.. Battery looks like 4000mah only..
Amazon tecnical customer care response is very very worst when i wish to replace the mobile they are not willing to replace it.. their intention is to regret return / replacement.. I wish to give zero star but there is no opinion available so that i am giving one star

I think there is no need to review the products on amazon. They prohibit to publish posts with negative review. I do not know what type of business policy amazon is adopting. It is not fair to harm/misguide those who purchase products based on review. I wrote very good and descriptive review about samsung m30s but they did not publish. I am writing this one just as a formality. It looks like amazon and samsung are no more brands. They are loosing their goodwill and treating customers in their own style. Never expected such a bad manner from amazon. They are just promoting M30s for which this handset is not deserving. Suggestion for those who are planning to purchase: Better to go to the market and purchase a phone without thinking about brands. In this competitive era all phone companies are providing security patch from time to time, maintaing payment security and considering about consumer's health so I would suggest no need to be a blind in respect of brand. Further, samsung is not a brand in my opinion. They are not doing different from other companies. If you want to know more about samsung better to install Samsung Members app and you will find everyone is frustated even a user of samsung note 10/10+ . In reality samsung does not provide value for money.
Overall conclusion is Don't go for this mobile. Better to purchase other brand from your local market. I do not suggest amazon. It is my last product from amazon. The reasons of purchasing samasung in my case.
1. Knox security
2. Samsung pay
3. Secured folder
4. Samsung file manager with cloud option
5. Bixby home
6. Timely updation of security patch
7. Better buit in quality

And nothing in this mobile which i mentioned.
It is just a simple phone with samsung branding. Very poor network reception. Dolby atmos is just an option and there is no enhancement in sound quality.

Overall I am strictly saying "Do not purchase this mobile".
And if you are a samsung boy then you will surely hate this product.

Please don get cheated by this corporate heartless giant. Go for vivo z1 pro or realme xt or 5 pro. 4 times better than this phone. 6000 Mah battery is the greatest eyewash of 2019! Even samsung M30 performs much well! The company is so arrogant that didn't bother to provide a back cover even worth 50 bucks or a thin screen film even. Didn't have any minimum in built protection even like gorila glass etc. You will get much great phones in much lesser price. Please abandon this brand. Cheating us for eras.

First impressions, the plastic is creaky, feels cheap and is a complete fingerprint magnet.
Doesn't come with a pre-applied screen protector, TPU case or Gorilla glass but it comes with a screen protection plan courtesy of Acko.
Rest of the specs are good on paper and makes the phone quite snappy to use, the camera is decent and the screen is good as expected from Samsung and the phone doesn't feel bulky despite having a 6000mAh battery.
Can't really complain for the 11400 I paid for it and it's definitely a better option than Vivo, Oppo, Realme, Xiaomi, etc at this price range

No words about Amazon delivery. It took a day to reach Bangalore from Chennai and 8 days to reach me from the nearest Amazon delivery centre. Great Amazon keep it up, even a turtle can beat you in this.
About the phone : I never used a phone in my lifetime like this kind of phone. Even my six year old son can draw better picture that the picture taken in this phone camera. Very Poor camera quality..
I don't want to write further. No words to describe this below standard product.

Everything great but camera detail is totally not upto the mark when zoom 48MP is useless even I had realme3pro its images are superb even though while Zooming characters are clearly readable in that.its 16 same story for front camera, Samsung plz do some in image processing hope will get software updates soon and if cromabost features is added than no body beat samsung. Really huge work to be done from your end. Hope you understand Indian user concern we want more clearly in zoom. After all its 48 I have a50 also images are almost same zoom in clarity totally missing.
Camra is average for front.
Camera is not so good for back.
Battery backup good.
Value for money is ok.

Recieved it yesterday morning 8 am(ordered in prime pre sale), super fast delivery by Amazon.

It had 70% battery when it opened and took around hour to get to 100%. And as you see in attached screenshot,  it still has 15% after day with all the setup, installations happening in backend and with 6+ hrs of screen time.

Mobile feels premium but it is little slippery. Have to wait for accessories like back cover as it's new model. Touch and UI is as per samsung standard.

This phone is not coming with screen protection plan as being projected in sale. Took one from godigit for 500 for sum insured 3700.

very happy with the product, as described each and every feature is authentic, moreover, the camera is absolutely amazing, it captures the total view and that to with amazing clarity.
 the battery life is indeed very long the screen display is wonderfully colourful and colour rich

you feel a sense of pride keeping this phone in your hand as it gives you a special look as if you're holding something unique.

The face recognition feature is also very accurate in recognizing your face.

The touch is also very good.
To think that I bought J7 Pro with 3GB 64 GB configuration at 18000 plus ,  Galaxy M30S 6gb 128 gb is truly a great value for money

Got the pearl white 128 GB edition. The phone doesnt weigh much in hand and is comfortable to hold.

The screen, when set on 'vivid' preset, is much better than that of my Oneplus6' screen.

Cameras are of just about average quality.

Interesting thing is when I opened the package, the phone gave a welcome message! Implies Samsung was so confident about their battery that they packed the phone without turning it off!

Havent yet had time to check battery life, but the screen is a killer.

I played some 4K 60fps hdr videos in youtube app on both m30s and oneplus6 side by side.
M30S asskicked oneplus6, especially when the camera was paning in the videos. The 60fps smooth effect was visible in M30s, but not in Oneplus6.

This is a great phone for people who mostly watch videos and use the phone for web browsing and social media.

Its not for gamers and photography enthusiasts

First of all they say it's a 15w fast charger. But it took a whopping, 3.5 hrs to charge from 0% to 100%. SUPERAMOLED?. WHEN I PLACED MY LENOVO K8 NOTE NEXT TO THIS PHONE AND WATCHED SONY TEN1 HD ON BOTH OF THEM THE CLARITY WAS MUCH BETTER IN K8 WHICH IS A TFT WITH FULL HD AND NOT SUPERAMOLED.
THE NETWORK SIGNAL ON MY AIRTEL SIM IN THIS MOB HAS ONLY 2 STICKS WHEN OTHER OLDER PHONES HAVE 3/4 STICKS WHEN PLACED NEXT TO EACH OTHER.
THIS PHONE IS ONLY SELLING FOR ITS 6000 MAH BATTERY..... STILL NOT SEEN THE BATTERY LIFE.

Earlier when I was planning to buy a new smartphone I was a bit confused. Actually I needed some branded compact good looking phone which may have all advanced features with a good battery life because I don't like putting my phone on charging after every major use. Options were/ (still are) available but I got more confused because if there were battery life than phone was so bulky, if there were all features so battery life was so poor, some phones were having all qualities but wwere over my budget, I mean super expensive. Suddenly I bumped into this mobile phone and I found this phone so perfect because it was a combination of all my individual needs inside this single device!

Initially we believe in that philosophy "You get what you pay for" but this device is an ample example that opposes to this theory. The best things about this phone is the battery life. If we talk about the camera the picture quality is awesome and some how that can easily challenge to the any professional camera. Over all this phone has all most required features that any expensive smartphone should have. Obviously I am amazed that the quality of its functions can easily beat any expensive smart phone in some major factors.

While I was deciding to buy a new smartphone there were a loads of options but I could literally have so impressed with this Samsung M30 because it has a huge battery, so that you may use any app constantly and use it without worry, though it has a fast charging.

Lookwise it is a surprise. Just due to containing the big battery inside 6000 MAH it may be so bulky and heavy that I was expecting before making a mind to purchase this phone. But when first time I put this in my hand I fould it very handy and light weight over all very easy-going. It was neither bulky nor so heavy. Lookwise this phone is so good as well.

I would highly recommend this phone to anyone, who is reading this review and planning to buy the all featured smartphone in a reasonable price. Good luck!!

The phone is nothing great.
Marketing strategy Samsung used was battery and display. Thats it. The camera which is said to be 48MP is totally waste. The selfie camera also is a disappointment. Planning to return it.

This is my initial review.
This phone will never let you feel that it's premium because it's sub standard.

Guys I would say, don't get fooled by bigger battery size. Rather go for a power efficient phone.You can carry a power bank .
Expected a phone with standard from Samsung.

Microphone speaker is substandard. People find it hard to hear me other side. It's just waste of money for everyone

Camera would be average. We shouldn't run behind pixel.

Read completely

i don't want to dislike this product. But due to it fitting at bottom side of side hardware key is not proper solid fitting. There are some air space . I suggest to all buyer to check this point of view after delivery.

I have raised my replacement claim but it too complicated, too much time take it, show that 9oct may be possible return where i received this product on 28th sep 2019. I have talk to Amazon agent twice or more times to regarding this issue. It's also take much time to wait 😣 on hold ring . Still i am waiting for them response.

On point of view of device

1) Night mode is not working good but average performance

2) Too much pre add contain app which occupied space, consume data, and use more battery

3) Camera quality not look like 48Mp clearity

4) touch is much sensitive so you have to care fully move fingers on it so not any unexpected action happen it

5) Nearly 50gb out of 64 data can we use

But i suggest this phone is good for long-term user, movie viewer, average photography, smart new features like pop up app, AR emoji, 3app simultaneously work possible.

Thanks you it's my point of view not be take your decision according above only remember it's will happen with you.

Very Bad Experience with my first choice Samsung brand M30s.Disappointed with its battery that company claiming of 6000Mah.Heating only after 20 minutes normal usage is also an issue.i had ordered Opal Black 6GB Ram.after 3-4 days of usage,felt too much heating &amp; battery draining severly .so i replaced the phone and got a new one in replacement.Sorry to say that the replaced phone was behaving just like the first phone.it is also heating with draining battery severly.due to over heating battrry drained upto 65% from 100% within 6 hours in office where i used it only one half hour with normal usage.i felt that this phone has some technical issues related to Network reception.in rural area these problems aggregated.I think Samsung should recall all M30s from the market.Despite of having too much attractive features this device is not impressive to me.in the areas/city with good network connectivity it works well.thanks to Amazon that managed replacement and after the replaced unit could not come upto expectation,paid full REFUND to me.

There is not much to write as it has already hundreds of thousands of review and I think everyone who are interested in this phone have already watched many videos on YouTube to know everything about this phone, so I won't go in much details.

▪︎The super AMOLED display is massive with full hd+ resolution, and when it comes to display everyone knows that Samsung makes the best displays in the world.

▪︎Sound quality is great when it comes to clarity and loudness. And it has the Dolby Atmos sound enhancement which can be enjoyed with a headset, and you can feel it's true potential with a 5.1 channel home theatre system.

▪︎The triple camera setup is great as well. It takes stunning pictures with the primary (48mp) sensor along with different effects to go with the other sensors as well.
It has amazing video recording capabilities, like slow-mo, super slow-mo, hyperlapse, super steady mode (with EIS) and it can record 4K videos as well (upto 10 minutes per video).
The front camera is good and it can record video upto 2336×1080 pixels.

▪︎The fingerpring reader works lightning fast every time. The facial recognition system is superfast as well.

▪︎It gives powerful performance with Samsung's inhouse Exynos 9611 processor and it is superfast. The RAM management is very well, even with 4GB of RAM (1.5 to 2GB of free RAM is available after optimizing, which disables all the running apps.)

▪︎It really has outstanding battery life with its montrous 6000mAh battery, making it one of the longest lasting battery phones. Charging it takes two and a half hour.

I am using it from 1st January and after using it for the past 15 days I can say that I am totally satisfied with this monster.

*Extra : The Opal Black colour (which is my preference) looks absolutely stunning (You can get the idea of that by seeing the photos I've uploaded, but believe me it is far better if you look it with your own eyes). Everyone I've shown this phone have said that it looks awesome in this colour.

*Bonus : You'll get a black coloured charger and data cable with the Opal Black version. (As you can see in the picture I've uploaded)

*Note : I recommend you to buy screen protectors from local stores for this phone (which you can get at just Rs. 50/-).
I brought the phone at the store and picked the glass protector by going through all the protectors the store had (I am a customer of this store from childhood, so I got that privilege) and found that only the Galaxy A30's full transparent glass protector fits perfectly (as you can see in the picture I've uploaded)
I don't know if every local glass protectors with Galaxy A30 written on the cover will be the same or not, but you can try checking it.

And, I will advise not to buy overpriced glass protectors for this phone from online as I've read many reviews with photos that either its the black border one which hides 1-2mm of each side at the edge of the display, or the normal (full transparent) one which do not covers the full screen on the side, leaving 1mm gap on both sides which is not pleasing at all specially when playing games or watching videos or movies in full screen.

I hope this review is helpful, specially for the ones who are thinking of buying this phone.

BATTERY 🔋❤️👍
Instead of talking about Samsung Galaxy M30s’ design, we’ll start this review with its innards. That’s because it has got some serious upgrades. The calling card of course, is its 6,000mAh battery – which hasn’t been seen on a mainstream smartphone yet, especially at this price point (there’s ROG Phone II as well, though one could argue that it’s focused on the gaming niche). And if the 5,000mAh pack on its predecessor managed to impress us, imagine how good the battery life on the M30s would be. Well, I tested out the phone as a daily driver and didn’t need to charge it before the end of two days. And this is when I used it extensively for battery-guzzling tasks like navigation and as a hotspot, along with streaming videos and podcasts, web surfing and checking email.

And if you’re worried about putting the device on charge overnight as it’d take a long time to juice up, then don’t. Thanks to 15W charging support, it goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about 2.5 hours. From my point of view though, maybe the brand should’ve opted for higher wattage, making charging it even faster.

PROCESSOR 😘
While the M30 made use of Samsung’s new Exynos 7809 SoC, the Galaxy M30s gets an upgrade in the form of the octa-core Exynos 9611 chipset. The 10nm silicon offers two quad-core clusters of Cortex-A73 and Cortex-A53 running at 2.3GHz and 1.7GHz, respectively. While the Galaxy M30s is better than the M30, it isn’t the fastest phone in town. Having said that, it does manage to hold its own. More importantly, I didn’t face any trace of lag while using it on a day-to-day basis. Multitasking is smooth as well, all thanks to 6 gigs of RAM.

GAMING ⚡
The Exynos 9611 SoC comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well. Playing Asphalt 9 or PUBG Mobile was a joyous affair, though there were certain instances of frame drops. And it’s worth noting that the device is able to play PUBG at the highest graphics settings, and if you choose the lower one, then the experience is much smoother. In terms of thermal efficiency, the device is quite good and heats up only a bit when it’s pushed to the limits.

OS✅
The phone ships with Android 9.0 Pie which is layered with OneUI. We already love this minimalistic interface and its features such as dark mode, though have to point out that there’s still some bloatware preinstalled and you do get unnecessary notifications from the MyGalaxy app.

AUDIO OUTPUT 🔊
Despite sporting a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M30s is quite loud. It’s not really rich however, and the fact that the sound gets muffled when you are holding the device in the landscape position is also a bummer.

CAMERA 📷🙄
Similar to its previous avatar, Samsung’s new Galaxy M30s flaunts a trio of sensors on its back. However, the primary camera gets an upgrade as it comes with a 48-megapixel sensor instead of a 16MP shooter. Sadly, the company hasn’t specified which sensor it’s using for the same, The secondary and tertiary snappers continue to be 8MP and 5MP units, respectively offering ultra wide-angle and portrait functionality.

The daylight shots have a lot of details and the phone manages to do justice to various objects in the frame. The colour reproduction is spot on too, and it’s interesting to see that Samsung has tweaked its image processing as not all images are oversaturated, and that’s great news for those who prefer natural output. The close-ups are quite good too, and though they aren’t as sharp as I’d have liked, the bokeh effect adds to their charm. The device lets you capture 48MP shots too, but you wouldn’t notice a world of difference between regular 12MP images and this one. The wide-angle mode lacks autofocusing capabilities, but offers an impressive dynamic range. With the dedicated depth-sensing unit, portraits turn out to be pleasing as well. Thanks to 4-in-1 pixel technology, low-light shots are good, but the device isn’t able to contain the exposure issues. You can also enable the night mode which increases the exposure time for getting good results in low light. The pics are certainly better than the ones shot in auto mode, but for some strange reason, the output is slightly cropped. Unlike its predecessor, the handset can capture videos at 4k resolution too, though you don’t get video stabilisation in this case.

The selfie camera on the Galaxy M30s remains the same as the M30 – a 16-megapixel unit. The quality is also the same, i.e. selfies are good, but they can’t compete with rivals. The software-based live focus is also not up to the mark as you’ll see the face getting softer and the edges aren’t well-defined either.

sAMOLED SCREEN 😍😍💪💗
Consuming multimedia on the Galaxy M30s is a joyous affair, all thanks to 6.4-inch Super AMOLED panel. The screen is sharp, offers ample brightness levels with good colours. Since it uses AMOLED tech, you also get always-on Display capability. Sadly, the screen lacks any sort of protective coating, and hence I’d suggest applying a screen protector.

BOTTOM LINE 👌
With all the offers provided i.e 10% instant discount via sbi cards plus 1000 rupees cashback as Apay balance, purchasing this monster is a no brainer! The Samsung Galaxy M30s clearly ranks among the top choices in the sub-Rs 15k segment.

PROS
Astounding battery life
Great shooting capabilities
Smooth performance
Immersive Super AMOLED display

CONS
Night mode isn’t the best
Selfie shooter could’ve been better
No display protection

 The M30s falters in some areas – performance in day-to-day use needs more optimization, the software could do with more features, and low-light camera performance could be better. But, when it comes to the value-for-money quotient, the Galaxy M30s is undoubtedly the new champion in Samsung’s budget lineup and gets a hearty recommendation. ⭐⭐⭐⭐

This is the first time I bought a phone which is not a S series in Samsung and it the worst product I have ever used. Huge marketing by amazon and showing very high configurations to attract the customer for the sale. The moment I got the phone I was very excited but after unboxing it, I found Samsung has cheated the customers.
1. There is no SUPERAMOLED display.
2. Rear camera is very bad.
3. For front camera they are saying it is 16 MP but it is not even 2 megapixel. Every pic is blur.
4. Battery is good, but they have given very slow charger I feel like I am charging my power bank not the phone.
5. Weight of the phone is too much.
6. Only one thing is good that is UI
7. One more thing there is no return policy for the product. I called to amazon customer support people three times and they said if there is any technical issue then only we can help you out with the replacement, but return is not possible at any condition.

Timely delivery by Amazon as usual, got it within a day. The phone is a good looking device, all plastic. The display being an AMOLED is pretty good. The phone had about 50% charge out of the box. It contains a sim ejector pin, a charger and a C type USB cable along with the usual paperwork. Setting this up was extremely easy. On switching on, the setup was easy as it provided an option to transfer data from old phone to new phone using Samsung Smart Switch. This can be achieved either through a cable or a wireless connection. Samsung smart switch helped transfer all contents from my old Moto to this one and in less than 45 minutes including all folders and subfolders located in the SD Card. Better have a USB C to USB cable handy as the two phones (old android phone and M30s) can be connected through a cable to transfer all apps, contacts, call logs, messages in addition to the Apps. The phone also served as a power bank and charged my old phone while transferring data.  On first usage, some of the pros and cons.
Pros:
1. The display is simply superb. Watching a movie or a photo with clear colours and brightness. Black is real black, unlike an LCD screen.
2. The fast charger is a 15 watt charger, it took more than an hour to charge from 45 to 100%. The battery can last for well over a day with the usual usage of apps, music and watching videos.
3. There is an option to hide the notch, but the settings is sort of hidden under advanced settings under the Apps section.
4. One UI is pretty functional and smooth. After using for about half a day got used to it.
6. I observed no lag or stutters while switching apps or using multiple apps, RAM management is pretty good. I did not try playing heavy games such as PUBG or Asphalt, I guess the processor can handle these at medium settings.
7. Several pre-installed apps can be uninstalled.
8. The single speaker at the bottom is just sufficient, while some users may find this as a con.
9. Sound reproduction is pretty good through earphones, has several settings to tweak according to one's liking, added to this is Dolby Atmos function.
10. USB C type port with a 3.5mm Jack.
10. 6000mah battery, can serve as a power bank with the appropriate cable if needed.
11. Finally the price. With a 10% SBI Card discount and a thousand rupee prime cash back, this price was too attractive to ignore.

A few small quirks:
1. The notch though has an option to be hidden still leaves a small portion open. It does not get fully hidden.
2. Unable to configure Google Feed / Discover for news feeds which I had got used to in my earlier phone. Not sure if I could not locate the settings or its an issue with the UI of Samsung.
3. The single speaker at the bottom may not be too loud for some, I found it adequate.
4. A plastic (PolyCarbonate) back, though looks good may be a con for some.
5. Able to connect USB pen drive OTG, unable to find a method to eject it from the settings.
6. The camera photos are quite average. Hope future software updates can help improving this.

Add a good 5D temper glass and the phone is safe and looks good. The pearl white piece which I bought is indeed a pleasant looking one. Overall, worth the wait to buy this phone. Lastly, unlike the other phones holding a flash sale where the phone gets sold out in less than a minute, this one still is available at the time of writing this review.

Definitely recommended for the price and performance parameters. this phone does tick on most of the requirements of a premium phone. The battery is a big deal maker.

Before writing a honest review of Samsung M30s I must say Samsung engineered this phone to the “PERFECT” level. I have used it. Using it. Experiencing it. Then only able to write my review to support others to buy it. The Dynamic Display. Fluid Speed. Massive monster power of 6000mAh. Amidst so many smartphones popping every month with many spec, Samsung stands apart with its own hardware-camera-battery perfection smartphone. About M30s I must say after using for few days continues Gaming, Movie streaming. Calling Audio/Video. Net Surfing. Photo editing/taking I came to a True-Honest verdict of this amazing yet unique smartphone.

DISPLAY – 10.10 POINTS  – The best immersive True SAmoled display is a wonderful delight to the eyes. What Samsung is known for its OLED displays it is also well justified in M30s. Even after watching a full movie or playing games I have not felt any eye strain/tiredness. Thanks to the Extra Brightness/Contrast nits enhancement the M30s goes clear and bright in Sunlight also. Go to option “VIVID” in display setting and you will love the color depth while watching movies or gaming.

BATTERY – 10.10 POINTS  – The USP of M30s is of course 6000 mAh Battery powerhouse. Practically when I tested running the 4G LTe and gaming as well like PUBG/Asphalt races the Battery still gave me 30% juice by 12.30 midnight. So if one use this phone Not like me a heavy gamer then M30s will come definitely for 2 days straight backup.  15W fast charging is good enough. Hints which I do take more out of the Battery is You can have the battery life upgraded by simply:1.Turning off automatic brightness (no sensors, uses camera which drains a battery the most) 2.Turning off smart stay which also uses the camera and eats the battery

CAMERA – 8.10 POINTS – The 48 Megapixel is a delight to take shots in daylight with all the Bookeh effect to panoramic/wide angle shots. What I found is sharper/contrast/details depth and color saturation even after zooming every photos is TRUE quality &amp; clarity. But when it comes to Night shots little noise level but can be manageable average. Not bad under this Price segment.

CPU/PROCESSOR/UI – 10.10 POINTS  – The Galaxy M30s is powered by Samsung own made Exynos 9611 system-on-chip (SoC). The phone’s user interface is clutter-free. The big app icons and easy-to-navigate UI make the phone easy to use. It is in the same league as the Snapdragon 710 SoC. Octacore, 2.3 GHz + 1.7 GHz gave me the exact clock speed. No issues of lagging or anything.

CALL+CONNECTIVITY – 10.10 POINTS  – There is support for dual 4G as well as VoLTE, Bluetooth 5, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, and the usual sensors. What I found best of the best is the Bluetooth-5 version which very strong for music wireless even if you are sitting another room. Call quality is superb HD + Noise cancellation works as mentioned.

SOUND  – The true DOLBY ATMOS is a delight to hear music with either with Bluetooth or wired earphones. Even the speaker also average good loud for the price given. No complaints here.

BEST FEATURE  – M30s in spite of massive 6000mAh battery the phone is unbelievably lighter as compared to M30 or A9 Pro which are 5000mAh segment old version. Another feature I loved is the Big Display 6.4 is not that big in hand and can be used by both small and big hand people.

CONS – As of yet I am unable to find any Cons in M30s as good and heavy as I am using it. Thanks to Samsung well research and engineering in making this “Masterpiece Monster”. Kindly use it then only write a review and please don’t go by Fake Reviews.

My sincere thanks to “Amazon Team” &amp; the “Seller STPL Exclusive Online Seller” for delivering a genuine product on time. Highly recommended Go for it no second thought here. Price totally reasonable and worth to invest our hard earned money on Samsung.

okok camera , not that sharp photos.
very disappointing assesories included in the box , no earphones,  no tempered or screen protector,  no backcover,  length of c type data cable is too small it is hardly 1.5 feet long.
i think all this should be included if we customers is prefering to buy M30S instead of M30.

Everything is great as it's specs,
Snappy performance,
Great cam,
Enough battery for 1day(2hr movie on Amazon prime 720p(1080p is available but only in 30min it used my 50% of data) drops 15% on mobile battery
But
What I m missing is it feels awkwardly cheap in hand with glossy plastic , heavy, fat, no premium metal,glass :(
Coming from miui I also miss their many handy features BUT hey I can make that sacrifice for the given specs, sAMOLED display to binge watching Netflix, Amazon Prime in highest quality possible. Dolby Atmos is cherry on top.

Over all this phone is good and value for money.Especially the battery backup is Awesome , but Charging takes time may be due to 6000MAh.
And at times the camera clarity is not that great and if you say 48 MP ppl won't believe.
But the display , display quality, built quality, all good.

I brought this phone at a good price. Delivery was very quick. Thanks to Amazon. But I am not sure if its quality is upto the mark. I feel this is a very delicate phone. I brought it as my secondary phone. Already have 5T 8gb. Battery is superb. Sound and display is good. I found some hanging issues. Nothing to worry. I will update more in coming days .

Really disappointed with the phone after using it for last 3-4 days.  Please find below issues in the phone.

1 - Vibration of Notifications ----  I use apps like Twitter, FB as any general user...  - and to be updated- I receive notifications ---  The Most disgusting thing in the phone is  - It keeps vibrating for each notification for each Tweet (by twitter),  any kind of notification, the phone vibrates.  It is so much disturbing that there is no option to disable it.  I have talked to customer care, visited forums but  this is Phone's default feature  rather i will call it as  - Defect feature....  It is so much distressing to keep phone on table or something...  It continues vibration unless the only option is to switch off the phone or disable the mobile data, so that there is no notification.  Haven't even expected from SAMSUNG that this basic feature Or I should say common sense to keep this option (to disable it)  with user is missing in the phone.

2 - Mobile/wifi Internet access to specific app ---  Now, I keep internet access off to specific apps like Netflix, youtube etc for kids Or personal use.  But there is no option to disable internet access to specific app. I have tried using this feature by opting  - Disable Background Access - But this does not serve the purpose, app still gets data and gets updated and it can be used.  Please provide option to the user to restrict data for specific app.

As a new Samsung user, please consider and implement this as feedback in your marketing and product development team ----  Better to focus more on simplicity of using the phone rather than spending on lot of advertisement. Phone lacks very basic features of disabling vibrations and restricting data. These features are most common and available in every phone.

I bought opal black 2 days back. Amazon was excellent in terms of delivery. Regarding this phone I'll will cover few minor cons which are not covered in techies review which you should know. But again you must consider the price range as well before making decisions
Pros: (mostly covered in you tube videos)
1. Considering the price range, screen size is big
2. Though back cover is polycarbonate, it looks glossy n stylish. Don bother about people saying it's plastic material. N btw, plastic is more durable than glass. Also, if you put Mobile cover then it's design does not matter. So, back design should not be a concern.
3. Battery is awesome
4. Processor is fast, no lag at all (till now)
5. Display is super awesome since sAmoled screen is there
Cons:
1. Network receptivity is little poor. My previous Motorola gets full network at same location where m30s shows 2-3 bars. Same issue with wifi network. Major drawback since primary function of any mobile is to help us talk which is compromised.
2. Once you disconnect an ongoing call, end call screen continue to display for 1 sec or so. This made me wonder initially if the call is disconnected or not.
3. App scroller screen is horizontal n can't be changed to vertical. So if you are used to of vertical scrolling (like me), it will take time to get used to. Though, can be fixed by installing some app launchers
4. Very rarely but yes sometimes finger print sensor does not work. Lag of just micro seconds not much
5. Camera is just ok.
6. I use very fast broad band which never let any video buffer even for 1 sec in my amazon fire stick or any other mobile.  But in m30s, it does for 1-2 sec :( This was most disappointing for me as I watch lot of videos online.
Hope this will help you make your decision but as I said, do consider features viz a viz price range. Will add more as n when I get to know.
Like if this review helped you.

Happy  with Amazon fast delivery and phone is also very good but few things are missing by Samsung  like headphones,  they should give screen guards and back cover also with newly launched  phones  because this is newly launched phone and we are not getting  screen gaurds and cover  in markets. But mobile is excellent and camera is also very good

I brought this phone for my Dad with my first month stipend. This phone perfectly sits in Budget Segment with Ample Features. If you are normal user, I would suggest you to go for 4GB version. If you will use PUBG and other gaming apps, then go for 6GB.
Battery is a mammoth size battery, so for a normal user, it should be sufficient.
Processor: I will say this is the best processor created for Budget Buyers in India. You can look at any other phones processor in similar Range, the you will get to know about this processor.

No multiuser
The Fast charger provided is really slow takes about 2 hours
Slight heating is observed after about 30 mins of IMO video call

Will add after few days of usages
Note, you may need to set the display property to vivid and enable blue light setting s to get optimal colors

Slow mobile, slow response. Didn't even got the jio double data offer...offer is mentioned but they say m30s is not eligible...scaming people with fake promotions...add extra 2000rs and go for realmext instead or go for realme 5 cause this mobile is only going to disappoint you..multi-touch becomes unresponsive in less than an hour while playing pubg mobile, can't shoot while running...battery is good but performance is worst...even the camera is also bad...

1. I noticed a serious problem as soon as I took the device first in my hand. It feels like the body of this device from the sides(especially from the heights) is loose or something and it makes some creepy sounds when I hold my device firmly as if the back cover fitting is not proper with the body. It also feels like there is a hidden button on the sides as I get "Tap" sound on holding the device.
2. Apps are closing automatically during use.
Please give me solution for this problems....

This review is mainly for the people who are buying this for 6000mah battery and a 48mp camera.

I had a Redmi 3S Prime which had a 4000mah battery with 5 inch screen at 720p resolution which lasted for around 1.5 - 2 days when it was new.

This one has a 6000mah battery with 6.4 inch screen at FHD+ resolution, faster processor, higher resolution camera and far more sensors than the 3s. So it won't last as good as the Redmi 3s Prime.

The phone will last for 1-1.5 days depending on the usage. Camera quality is just about average but with some good features. Almost all the phones of Samsung have SuperAMOLED display these days so that's also a plus point. 6000mah battery is a necessity in phones with above 6inch screen(FHD+). One UI is not as feature rich as MIUI but has better quality than MIUI.

People are easily misleaded by the self proclaimed 'GYAANIs' on youtube these days.

Ordered on prime early access and got it by next day, delivery is always amazing as it is.
About phone,
1. Display - looks perfect with AMOLED.
2. Battery - Will last for a day of you are not browsing too much, pretty average compared to snapdragon.
3. Body - It looks good,but build is not great which doesn't looks like the product from Samsung. Anyway you can keep it safe by having back case on your own.
4. Speed/ Proceesor - Exynos won't give more effective speed when you are using multiple apps opened in parallel, in that way you always need to go with snapdragon.
5. Charger - It doesn't seems to be an 15w fast charging, it takes more than 2 hours to get charged for 50%.

Cons,
Very disappointed with Samsung that they haven't offered headphone with this, charger is very worst compared to any other brands.

CAMERA IS JUST ABHORRENT! The detail is just not there. Besides that everything else was on par with other smartphones in the same price range.

The aesthetics of the phone are quite good despite having a bit of a chin, and the blue polycarbonate back which I got it in, looks extremely attractive.

The display is very sharp and bright, runs smoothly with negligible amount of lags. High graphic setting is set by default in PUBG but go with the medium setting to have a better gameplay experience. (DOESN'T SUPPORT FORTNITE)

Sound at max is on the lower side but is clear.

Battery, the main highlight of the phone delivers on the hype, lasting for 2 days on frequent usage.

Ordered first day, got for 11.5K INR. Value for money product. Battery life is awesome

After 100 days usage.

Battety backup
Battery is boasted to be 6Ah. But practically battery backup is average one is required to recharge phone everyday anyway. So it doesn't feel like 6Ah battery. I always keep power saver mode on optimised then at the end of the day battery remains some 40%. If I don't use any power saver mode then by the end of the day battery falls around 25%. So I can't say battery backup really feels like 6Ah.

Camera quality

Camera quality is sober though it's not very great. But it's acceptable.

Build quality
Build is plastic made yet it is doing well. Mine falls average once in a week. So far its ok. I have deployed screen guard and leather flip cover to give additional protection to body.

Sound
Sound is better and audible. Dolby sound is great.

Signal reception
Signal reception is indeed better than all Chinese xiomi and redmi models which I have used in past.

Overall battery backup is average. It doesn't seem like 6000mah. I have to keep on power saver mode always then I get some good backup otherwise battery drains fast.

Display is very bright and impressive, sound quality is good. Camera quality is also good.

Please dont waste money
I wasted mine so suggesting you all to buy any other device but not Samsung 🙏
Fingerprint sensor is dead slow
Face recognition doesn't work 4 out of 10 times
Camera okay in outdoor daylight but bad in low light and moreover edge distortion problem is thier in pics
Performance below Snapdragon 665
Battery is oky gives 10 hrs screen on tym but not that great as shown in advertisements that it'll work 2 days long
And moreover phone is not durable i dropped it once the back cover got deattached from edge of the screen
In end i would suggest go for any other x y z brand available in market but not Samsung
The overall usage experience is laggy
Please save your hard earned money only buy if you want to use whatsapp and do phone calls

I am writing this review after 4 days of extensive use. For better comprehension purpose I will divide the review in pros and cons.
Pros
1. Excellent battery life even after extreme usage for 2 days it was left with 9per. Gaming, data, transfer, running benchmark, video recording all included
2. Super amoled works like a charm, content are crisp and brighteness is phenomenal. Black's and really black
3. In hand feel is really due to light weight and slim phone

Cons

1. Speaker quality is average nothing to take note of
2. Camera misses out of details while you zoom, but this can be fixed with software update
3. Build quality is ok ok as you can heart rattling when you knock the phone and sides also makes sound when squeezed

Highly recommended phone and the deal gets sweetened with the offer Amazon gives. We got 4 devices at my office. Value for money deal must buy

Im gonna keep it short 😂...if u dont care about grinding just PUBG for highest FPS possible...just want to use it as a daily driver and media consumptions..this phone is just for you.
The display is beautiful to look at..weight balancing from samsung deserves some credit..The Battery is literally Monster. And i mean it.Exynos 9611 is enough to handle ur multitaskings and The Ram management and smoothness of One UI is impressive.
Worth every penny of the 11.5k i spent on this beauty

I surprised to see so many neg reviews for M30s. This phone is a mid range beast and Samsung known for quality components not for playing games crap. This is a very nice phone, very nice grip. Samsung puts his best processor in it and camera quality is also very good for this price range. I read some crap that M30s has Network issue with IDEA which is not true. Go get and activate your 4G first than try to connect. You can also connect via 3G if 4G is not activated but dont complain without knowledge. GO AND GET SOME GOOGLE EMPTY HEADS. I connected my idea and it accepts that so much INSTANT by default as a VoLTE. Thank you Amazon also for nice delivery on time within 1 and half day.

This review is based on usage after 3 days.

1.Battery- 2 day battery life on heavy usage 10/10

2.Screen- Crisp, vibrant SAMOLED display 8/10

3.Camera- Front and back- Not extremely good but manageable considering  the price point
7/10

4.Build quality- Well built, no flex on applying  pressure. Should be okay to carry in tight Jean's pockets. Plastic back ensures better grip compared to aluminum back phones.
8/10

5.Auto brightness- There seems to be a small lag in auto brightness adjustment of about 2-3 seconds which can be annoying at times when outside and you need to check your phone immediately.
4/10

6.Vibration motor- A medium intensity motor. You may miss calls on the go if it is on silent in your pocket. The sound of the motor is quite low though so you won't disturb others with the motor sound.
6/10

7.Fingerprint sensor-Quick in recognizing the print, a microsecond delay, unnoticeable  unless focused on.
9/10.

8. Speaker- A mono speaker on the bottom with decent loudness and Great sound clarity although I found myself covering the speaker and muffling the sound while watching videos. 7/10

9.Calls- Samsung has given a tiny speaker grill above the selfie camera with good sound quality and a noise cancelling microphone on the top and bezel. No issues with it whatsoever. Good sound clarity on both sides.
8/10

10. Physical buttons- The volume rocker and hold/power buttons are quite sturdy with 0 wobble. Very tactile and responsive.
9/10

11. Charging time- Takes a long time to fully charge this monster. About 2.5 hours from 30% to 100%. Once it's charged though, gives great peace of mind that you can stay unplugged  throughout the day.
7/10

12. Dolby atmos experience- Works only when plugged into the 3.5 mm Jack. Tried it and found that it truly makes a difference. The sound becomes much richer and clearer and surrounded my senses completely. A treat for audiophiles.
8/10

13. Processor- No lag while playing graphic intensive games like PUBG and real racing etc.
The phone didn't hang while multitasking many apps and resumes to the state in which they were exited with no problems.
8/10

14.Software- The new One UI by Samsung  is quite a treat. I found myself using the phone with one hand a lot. The UI encourages the use of the phone with one hand and also has a dedicated one handed mode which can be engaged either with triple tapping the home button or swiping diagonally from the bottom right/left corner. Although there are preinstalled Samsung apps which I don't  mind as I have either uninstalled them or turned off the notifications .
8/10

Verdict- An excellent buy. Happy with the purchase. The only qualm I have with it are the vibration motor and the auto brightness adjustment. Maybe Samsung will address this problem in future software updates.
Final rating-8/10

So Samsung has smartly launched this phone with super specs..I got the 128 GB 6 RAM version.. does it live the expectation?? ... well quite not.. the 48 megapixel cam is questionable whether it's really 48 mp... It clicks decent pictures but you are left wanting.. the touch experience is not to the mark either especially while typing msgs and can be a little irritating .. also the 'monster' battery dries up in a day even if you don't use heavy gaming apps or watch movies.. don't exactly know whether Samsung has done an authentic job with this one...

Battery is OK
But  very bad experiences on camera....
Not a 48 mp camera it's just 10/12 mp quality. Sometime camera heat very much.
Like a lower grade mobile company phone ..
Thanks Samsung for a great product..

Primarily this phone is for everyone who need an astounding battery life. it will last for 4 days for a medium user. it will last for 2 days even for a heavy user.

Display is really good and with the bigger screen watching videos will be amazing . Continuous watching doesn't seem to take atoll on the battery

Cameras are decent. i really don't know what the fuss is about 48 MP cams. Its really good in the day light and pretty average in low light situations.  Seems to be marketing strategy these days with triple cams and and bigger pixels but the results doesn't speak for that

Build quality is good and this phone is sleek foo a phone with 6000 mah battery.

Call clarity, speaker quality seems to be good. Software is the usual Samsung one with lots of unwanted apps.

I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants an amazing battery life, takes good photos and performs well for all daily tasks . one shouldn't buy this phone based on the camera.

Charging time is approximately 2 hours 30 minutes from 1%. the charger provided has tag that says adaptive Fast Charging.

Overall its a value for money from a leading manufacturer of electronics.

I feel the battery life is not so good as it is 6000MAH, the software is not good managed enough with battery performance.

The built in quality is not good for the price, the polycorbonate back covers upto front screen that looks like cheaper phones,

I don't like the built in quality and battery life other than these 2 the phone display and camera is good even the performance I feel small lagging.

I sold my 26 days old redmi note 7 pro to support samsung over Chinese brand. So my comments might reflect an indirect comparison with that phone.

1. Physicality... Quite comfortable to hold. Doesn't feel heavy. However fingerprint sensor sits a little too high for small hands.

2. Camera... Front camera by default has too much of beauty mode washout. Rear camera is good during day light but not great in artificial light. Videos look quite better in which sometimes a small lag and focus issue was observed.

3. Battery...Looks good. Expected at least 50% more than 4000 mah but it is approx 30-35% more despite having super amoled screen advantage.

4. Sound.... Loud speakers' output is just average. Earphone sound quality is good.

Overall, a good attempt by Samsung. Hope they could improve upon camera quality and battery performance with updates.

Pros:
Mobile is really cool for whoever wants a very good long lasting battery.
When its new and with less application, battery lasts for almost 1.5 days.

as you start using it daily and fill mobile with lots of apps battery will last almost a day with 12 hours of social media surfing, videos for 12 hours &amp; games for 3,4 hours.

You can enjoy camera which is magnificent

cons:
If you use lot many mobile feature from settings like 'face unlock', all day 'sync' and 'location' then battery wont last an entire day.

Fingerprint reader is on the back panel next to camera which is not so comfortable to reach all the time.
Plus fingerprint reader is small and of very poor quality as it takes at least 2,3 try when your are in hurry or  4 to 5 tries when your fingers are little bit dusty or dirty.

Overall:
Rest of the things are pretty good.
Enjoy the 64gb storage and 4gb ram for good performance.
I am happy with the device as i am software engineer and i keep a good eye on all the technical parts plus i take a good care of the device.

Overall it's good phone under this budget with some offers clubbed together and camera many were complaining it's not up to Mark and also you should have in mind that you are not expecting a DSLR quality out of it and images are good. I also liked the battery back up with few hours of video playback and some gaming. And no lag or heating issues with vigorous usage till now these are the primary problems so that has been eliminated here and I don't know about others and their expectations on it but I feel it's the best phone for my mother. She loved it too and she was using S6edge previously and it's way better than that (no offense).
Thank you.

For the price it is an okayish product .
Few issues-
1. Signal quality is not great
2. Despite having 10nm processor (9611 which is same as A50s) and Amoled screen ,the 6000 mAh battery only lasts 1.5 day on full use . I expected better like 1
2+days . Brands like vivo ,Asus give same backup with their 5000 mAh battery with LCD screens .
3.Cameras are not good(both front and back) 48MP is a gimmick , no significant improvement in quality

It's a great phone if you want a big screen with Amoled display and good battery

Things I like most in this handset
1. Battery life , which can be extended to many days. I like to use phone in its Maximum power saving mode (basic form), and in earlier models we had no options of voice recording in this mode, which is now available makes the phone real useful for people who loves to record voice on trip and treks.
2. In built call recording feature.
3. In built support for Battery status of Bluetooth connected devices.
4. Those 3 swipe up keys as an Alternate approach for back, running task is killer feature.

phone is full of many killer features, but i wish it had fingerprint reader active in maximum power saving mode or at-least option of making it active or close or voice assistant in that mode.

Best part of phone is its battery, one to-do is deleted from mind, or one can say bothering is solved as its big relief that one does not have to think about how much battery or charge is left.

As i use it i realize how much R&amp;D has gone into this product...

SERVICE CENTRE AUTHORITIES ALSO DENIED TO HELP BY SAYING THEY DONT HAVE REQUISITE PARTS.VERY SHAMEFUL SAMSUNG AND AMAZON.YOU KNOW WELL HOW TO HARASS CUSTOMERS....VERY NICE

First of all camera 48MP is just for name shake, it doesn't compete redmi Y2 as well front camera less performance then redmi Y2 , screen size also smaller then redmi Y2, little bit advantage in battery segment 1 or 1.30 hours last compare to redmi Y2 it's not big deal , very disappointed front camera built quality , screen size function etc . Accept battery life the rest disappoint ....guys if you are Redmi smartphone user then you would come to know how samsung fooled people ....I recommend for Redmi phones because redmi has a built quality,  battery life, screen, performance, cameras, gaming, videos,  photos in every segment it's good, has a lot function compare to there devices etc. After purchasing Samsung m30s next day I saled it to someone now waiting for Redmi note 8 pro to buy....About Amazon services i have very bad experiences i had ordered this stuff on 2and Oct 2019 doing Great Indian festival offer, 14k but Amazon delivery this after co.palaining more than 15 times then I got this device on 10th Oct , product was out for delivered but later they return to the Amazon delivery center in Delhi,  I'm staying just nearby but it takes 6 days to delivered New Delhi amazon delivery service center to Ashram New Delhi im very very very disappointed of amazon service and also delivery associate.

I don't trust the product . There were scratches on the body even after receiving a sealed packed box. Moreover the battery is worthless. It is a scam. 6000 mah will not last even 9 hrs . Lolol. Battery drains off even without an extensive usage. Go for some other phone guys . This phone is not just worth the money you pay for .

One of the best mobile in this segment &amp; simply go for it (Not recommended for longer gaming users).

It comes with an sAMOLED display so you can get a brighter screen and better viewing angle while compared to the LCD panels like MI phones Note 7 pro etc...

Pros:
- Great display: sAMOLED display
- Monster  Battery: 6000 Mah battery
- Low SAR: lower radiation

Cons:
- The back panel is slippery and feels like non-premium
- Doesn't come Earphones along with the mobile
- poor low light photography poor(primary and secondary) and lacks detail on front cam

Overall good product from Samsung.

I got this product yesterday. The battery running out in 7 hrs in stand by time. Its too hot while you call or use any app within 1 minutes. Terribly heating if you are using mobile data. Hope either got a copy of the product or defect in this product. I contacted Amazon for replenishment and set technician visit but they are not reached on time, given new reschedule date after a week. horrible service once you buy this product.

They replaced this with new product which is working very well. but camera quality is not 48 mega pixel

Following things I don;t like about this mobile...

1) Camera- Average ( it should be SONY sensor)
2) Battery-  highly dissatisfied- not even sufficient for 1 day battery, despite of 6000 Mah.  Zero score for Monster (Chintu) Battery.
3) Design - is very average.
4) Screen- No gorilla glass protection given on front and back.
5) TPU case- No TPU case given with Box.
6) Charging time- is high.
7) Fingerprint sensor- could have been improved (too slow) .
8) Signal Reception- very poor
9) heating problem

Good point
1) Display is very Good
2) Sound is loud
3) phone is handy
4) Camera back design is very nice.
5) Display touch is very nice.

Overall lots of disappointing thing present with this Samsung M30s.
instead of that I would suggest you to buy Redmi phones.
Please go for Sony camera sensor instead of any other.

1st Samsung Smartphone but, not Satisfied.

This phone is very good at this price point.
Although fingerprint reader is slow as compared to competion.
But when talk and look at the display and design nobody is near to the samsung.
Display quality is more than awesome.
And that 6000mah cell is enough for 2 days.
Phone charges fast not very fast but its good.
And samsung  improves the performance also when compared to older laggy samsung devices.
Camera quality is good at this price.
Overall its agood perchase.
And in white color this phone looks monster and it definitely looks like high end flagship phone

Awesome phone with great battery life. For normal usage with location on you will be left with 70% battery after a days use. Keeping the phone overnight locked consumes hardly 1 to 2% battery. Samsung has done justice to mid-range phones with no compromises. Except you don't get a case or a screen guard. Which does not matter in terms of price. Phone is buttery smooth with Android 9. Just go for it. It is worth the price and the brand.

Worth for money at this price range. I am not gamer. So my views on regular usage.
Pros:
1. Good battery life. Full charge lasted for 2 days with medium usage. May be if we have heavy usage it would have drained in one day
2. Processor performance is best in this specification. Kindly don't compare processor with snapdragon. Every processor has it's own drawbacks.
3. Camera clarity met my expectations.
4. UI is superb.
5. Samsung proved their quality in Display segment.
6. Dolby atmos amazing. And speaker quality is more than sufficient for regular use. Microphone works well like charm
7. Stunning looks makes looks like premium mobile.

Cons:
1. No notification light on frontside. In case, I am not bothered about it.
2. Rear side is made with fiber. So it gives feel like using plastic.

Final verdict: It has less SAR value of 0.413 and for regular use it's best option to buy.

Thanks to Amazon for fast delivery.

The screen is really good.
UI is also smooth.
Low SAR value.
Can play battle royals(pubg,free fire,COD) in HDR.
My phone sometimes doesn't recognize the fingerprint.
Marketing gimmicks like 6000mah( around 5900 though and only 30 mins extra in real time usage than M30) and 48 Mega Pixel camera😢.
The camera is worst performer,below my expectations.
If other vendors can buy the same camera sensor from Samsung and take great pictures, I think Samsung has to consider if it wants to be relevant in this lower midrange market,the same sensor takes good photos in their A series smartphone , why.
And don't give excuse by saying we need to compromise because of low price. Yeah plastic back is acceptable, so does the back fingerprint sensor.
But then-
Who told you to give 3 cameras that is not well optimized.
Recently realme giving update to make improvement of XT , and we are still in security updates of August😢 why.
You take out the camera overall package is really good,bigger battery is essential and the weight well maintained.
Compromises are acceptable but not those marketing gimmicks.

Pros:
1.Powerful battery lasts 1 and half day.
2.Superb Camera 48MP (but it's only like 24MP)
3.Screen quality is unbelievable.
4. Price and durability and obviously from Samsung it's super affordable.
5.Weight distribution fabulous.

Cons:
1. Display colours' differ when pics opened it another phone.
2.Front camera is not that flagship.
3. No earphones included.

I am searching about the best value for money smartphone and the dream comes true as i saw the specifications of Samsung M30s the features of this phone is excellent as it has 6000mah battery capacity with 15watt adaptive fast charge to juice it up as soon as possible sAMOLED display was fantastic on this device colour contrast was super high as it is OLED panel.
Exynos 10nm processer boost the performance of the device as well as to help it to get a latest Android update
Triple camera was another positive side of this phone as it has ultra wide sensor,main sensor and depth sensor, camera quality was pretty decent
AOD make it feel like a premium device as very less phone are available in market having AOD
Optical Fingerprint on back side was optimized very precisely and responds quickly
That's all about main features of this device , yes there are more pros. But to feel that you have to get one for urself.
The only Cons. Of this device is the build quality , plastic casing slightly feel cheap but the colour gradient is covering that cons. So it was like nitpicking.

Battery life _ no doubt its actually last for 2~3 days upon moderate uses. First day played music, watched amazon prime video toutube still left with 29 % at 10pm.
Screen quality_ no doubt amalog display. U can expect quality same like 50k mobile ex oneplus7.
Camera quality _ no so good in low light but good in light condition. Honesly this has good camera for this price but dont expect camera like high end mobile.
Ram_ 4Gb but left with 1Gb only dont know about other mobile . U can gi with 6gb ram instead.
Built quality_ looks very stunning , back is curved a bit feels high end mobile . Also its front edges are also a bit curved which is looking perfect.
Sound_ supert sound wih dolbu effect expect very high wuality sound.
Video_ great performer . Played 1080p amazon prime video and feels experience like high end hdtv.
This device u can purchase at 11.3k around with instant sbi discount and amazin pay cashback.

A great deel for this price.
Anything else expecting ask me , i will answer.

I have been using this phone for more than 2 months now and this is one of the worst phones you could buy within the 20K budget. The phone gets heated up while charging and this charging process takes more than 4 hours with the samsung charger. The phone becomes so hot, both while charging as well as regular usage that after 30 minutes you would not be able to hold it in your hand, leave alone make calls. When I took it to Samsung service Center, they made me wait for one full day for doing a factory reset that never addressed the issue. They also had the audacity to tell me that the phone was getting heated while charging, but it has not crossed 50 degrees so I could continue using it. A phone which is barely 3 months old is now completely useless and Samsung does not give a damn about it, neither does their Service Center. If you are planning to buy this phone, you might want to think twice about wasting your hard earned money.

<div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3DNP6XA176OSJ"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/G1ZLl3LVDYS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A16hMBJeMES.png"/> I had made this review after using the phone extensively for 4 days!!

Internal memory : You will get 49.5 GB out of 64 GB out of the box

Face unlock : Superfast even in the dark

Fingerprint sensor : Superfast (you can register upto 3 finger prints)

Performance : This phone is a breeze if you look at specs, it doesn't disappoints you during performance. I had played continously PUBG for 3 hours &amp; phone was working flawlessly. I could sense very small amount of heat but that was just as small as heat of your hands. Phone didn't hanged at all.

Camera : It has 48MP camera with slow motion 240fps, wide angle, bokeh effect, hyperlapse. Photos were good. If you would expect photos like DSLR cameras, then you would be disappointed. As far as phone cameras are concerned it gave good result. (Photos/videos attached)

Fast Charging : I took fast charging tests for 2 consecutive days:
first day I had started charging battery with 31% level &amp; it took 2 hours to reach 98% battery level
second day I started with 25% &amp; it took 2 hours 6 minutes to reach 97% battery level

Battery : I was disappointed with battery performance. I don't find it to be 6000 MaH. Battery drains much faster, I was surprised at first. But then I gave it another chance second day, then third day, it doesn't last for even 24 hours. On one day I haven't even played PUBG , no movies , no camera usage , only Wifi, GPS, dual sim, 4-5  calls a day for 10-15 minutes max, still battery lasts for only 24 hours. Didn't expected this from Samsung.

CONS : No OTG, NO Infrared, No OTG

Please upvote if you find my answer helpful .

The battery life is great and can easily  last you for a full day even for a heavy user like me with still 30 percent left over.

Camera quality  though is horrendous  for something that touts its 48 mega pixels on its body. My earlier crappy Chinese phone took better pictures and it had a quarter of pixels.

Also a point deducted with all the bloatware it came with but I'm reasonably  happy with the purchase.

Display is great 4/5
Performance  is very poor 2/5 . Opening  4 or more app parallely ,displaying  wait or close the app.
Mainly I bought  this  mobile  by seeing  battery 6000mah but I after using 3 days o feel it's only 3850 mah. Saying 6000mah not worth to say that.1/5
Overall very bad choice of selecting this

This is a honest review after using the phone for more than 10days..

So please share your valuable time to get full details about this phone

1. *Battery* : The only pros I can find in this mobile is it's battery.. 6000mah is gr8. Definitely it lasts for 1.5 days...

2. *Charger* :  Cable is short and 15w charger seems like slow charger only since it wants to charge 6000 mah.. Other mobiles like realme 5 pro gives 18w in this price segment

*Display* : It doesn't stand up to the mark. I have compared with GALAXY S8.. This display is like a crap.. Even with a 8k redmi mobile this display doesn't feels better . For this 14k segment u can consider many other mobiles like redmi note 7 pro, realme 5 pro or even wait for redmi note 8pro since that may have better display I guess..

*Camera* : This is the place where I lose temper and decided not to buy any samsung phones under 50k. Those who are reading this reviews kindly check the image samples of Redmi note 7 pro &amp; Realme 5 pro from filpkart.. This mobile is utter waste, crap, rubbish in camera.. I didn't except such a camera performance from 14k mobile.. Even 8k mobile has more details than this camera images.. There is a *NIGHT MODE* option too which is totally a fraud mode.. It does nothing... Pure waste of money if you think this is a camera mobile...

*Performance* : It is better 4gb variant is far better, ONE UI far optimized. Games like PUBG, COD can be played with decent graphics..

*Protection* : There is no protection for screen and haven't included any case in box while 6k phones include case in box. Also I recommend only flip cover for this phone because if you accidently drop your phone flip cover reduces maximum damage, other case &amp; skin is not recommended as it does not have gorilla glass protection..

Overall my rating for this phone is *1/5*

The 1 mark is for battery and for RAM management

This phone is well suited for persons above 55+ age since they need long battery and a phone without lag

For Youngsters this phone is crap since only battery is best. Samsung come in 14k segment with lot of cos cutting

* 15w charger while other brand provide minimum 18w

*Rubbish camera while other brands provide better camera under 10k

* No Gorilla glass protection while other brands provide even for 8k mobile

*No case included in box while all brands provide case

So kindly consider REDMI NOTE 7 PRO or REALME 5 PRO or wait for REDMI NOTE 8 PRO if you are youngster..

1 star is also more for thi product which i have given as less than one is not accepted
Camera clearity is not as clear as you asume,
Battery backup not even last for 20 hrs
Mobile heatsup
Nd best thing is they dont even respond for your complain
They have not place option in amazon as well so that we can complain or solve probelm aslo return is not accepted nd the great part you should know is they provide option of replace where you need to fill details nd they will ingnor yor replace request

Camera is worst.
All the online reviews were misleading.
All three camera are useless.
Focus hunting in video recordings
Slow motion and super slow motion seems to record at the same speed.
Night sight and portrait mode does not work in google camera.
Front camera is like 2megapixel.
All pics are washed out.
Battery life is not outstanding.
Lots of Samsung's bloatware.
Lags sometime while swiping in home screen !
Avoid this phone at any cost.

I am searching from 6 months to buy a good budget friendly mobile with Super Amoled display, fast processor and good camera. Samsung M30 was good but it was below par performance and camera.
Then Samsung M30s arrived, which have stunning features at a great price
Pros:
1) Samsung sAmoled Full HD Display. No other phone brand available under 15K
2) 6000 MAH Monster Battery, first time in market with this price
3) Super fast Exynos 9611 Processor faster than SD 712
4) Triple Camera with 48 MP Camera with 1/2" Sensor including Wide angle and Telephoto Camera again No other phone brand available at this price
5) 15 W fast charger included in box. (Not available in Iphone 11 also)
6) Widevine l1 certification for watching videos in HD for Prime &amp; Netflix
7) Android 9 with Samsung One UI, butter smooth and good RAM Management
Cons:
1) Back panel is plastic ( It is not considerable because everybody using a protection case for their mobile)

Final Verdict:
Go blindly  if your looking for a Mobile under 20 Thousand Rupees

I bought the phone on the 2nd day of the sale (Oct 1st) with an estimated delivery date of Oct 3rd however, to my surprise, Amazon delivered it the very next day. I opened the phone and checked all the features and like almost all except one, the rear camera, which I was expecting to be better than others available in the similar price range. However, it really disappointed me. The pictures taken from my old Lenovo phone was way better than newly purchased Samsung M30s. The worst part with the phones is that you cannot return it once bought. I would expect Samsung to improve the picture clarity in future updates however, if it is not done, then I am sure that I will never buy Samsung phones in future and even would not even recommend it to my known ones.

Worst phone ihave ever used touch is not working properly pls don't buy in Amazon ,there is no return or refund policy but they tell us  in the app like easy return.dont be fool

Useless technicians, they don't give proper information and said install smart check app to test your phone and that app is also programmed for giving result like that phone is in good condition

Body structure is also not good it's like a plastic toy, the edges also not sealed properly totally waste of money😡😡😡

Thanks to Amazon great Indian sale and Samsung. Got it for only 11500 rupees only.

Pros:
1. Battery lasts really long.. even if you are very heavy user it will last easily one full day.🔋🔋
2. Samsung One UI is well optimized. 😍😍
3. The U notch is well designed and stunning sAmoled display gives awesome viewing experience.😍😘
4. Camera options and interface. Camera works really well in lighting conditions and captures stunning pictures. Video steady mode is really good. 📷📷
5. The exynos 9611 processor performs really well and runs without any lag even with extreme usage. 👌👌
6. RAM management is very good. 🤘🤘
7. Phones design is very attractive and its slim and lightweight even if it holds massive 6000mAh battery. 🥰🥰
8. Pubg 🔫🔫 runs smooth in SMOOTH/BALANCED/HD mode. We can play it HDR mode but not recommend at all.
And finally Biggest advantage is Samsung's brand value with very low price and heavy features. 👍👍

Cons:
1. In night mode the camera is worst. it looks like 1 MP camera in night. And the selfie camera in night is hilarious.  😭😢
Rear camera works ok ok though in night mode.
2. There is no inbuilt applock 🤬🤬and Samsung's S secure application is very hilarious. So about security you will have to install third party apps and you won't be able to lock with your fingerprint and face.  Samsung should provide in biuilt applock for better security.
3. The charging cable is small.😨 Its nearly half the length of average cable.
4. There is no back cover and screen guard provided with the box. 😖
5. When you end any call the screen shows call information for 3 to 4 seconds and you can't close it. 😣
6. Built quality is where Samsung have comprised a lot. Sometimes the buttons and fingerprint sensor makes noise while placing phone down which shows the build quality and finishing is not at all good.😠
7. There's not protection of gorilla glass 5.(Buy a nice back cover and full tempered glass)

Conclusion:
Its really a monster phone as Samsung says it. You are getting extremely good price to performance ratio with BRAND VALUE.
If you are having budget of around 14k then you must but it. Though the competition is very strong in this price range Samsung won't disappoint you this time and you will be a satisfied customer at the end.

😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍

Note: I will update full review shortly.  Thank you and like the review if you found it useful.
😀😀😀

Worst product, back panel is loose and it has sound too. I received it on 1 October 2019.on the same day, I placed my argue for replacement before amazon technical department. They started to harass me mentally. Firstly they said to me that replacement will be within 24 hours hand to hand. After 24 hours,  they said to wait for 72 hours. After 72 hours,they transferred replacement into refund. During refund amazon deducted Rs 1000. When I talked to customer care ,he said it is the norms of amazon business.

Don't buy this phone. This is a big cheat by Samsung. The 48MP camera picture quality is very bad than 5mp camera of Mi phones.
This is abig scam, don't go for this phone. If possible cancel your orders don't receive it. Otherwise you can only regret.

Following are problem that I am facing in this phone
1) during voice calling, sound of other person is so low that you can't hear it properly even in little noise
2) camera
  a) front camera is worst as it blur your face automatically  and beauty and normal mode are exactly same
  b) front camera is good but I doubt it has 48mp .my old galaxy core camera has better quality of image than this phone

3) upper portion of screen get heated

Battery is good but as for basic specifications are missing

Main function of mobile is calling if I can't  do this feature what is the use of phone
So guy please don't buy this problem and for Samsung do some thing for this issue

There are multiple issues with the handset, so I am going to mention one by one.
1. Network reception is pathatic at best
2. Battery life is extremely disappointing. My previous phone with 5000 mah battery use to go on for more than two days, but this so called 6000 mah battery monster survives hardly a day on heavy usage.
3. It heats like anything if you play a game even for 5 mins.
4. While charging the battery you always get Fast Charging massage, but it takes more than 3 hours to fully charge the battery.

There is no option to return the handset, so I called the Samsung customer care they told me to wait for some time as these issues might get resolved with updates so keeping my fingers crossed. I will update this review if, after updates this handset delivers what it promises. It is very unprofessional to release a phone with so many bugs just to be in the game. Hopefully, Samsung is reading this review.

One of the Worst phone ever I seen ,
Cons list :
1.Battery extremely disappointed too fast drained compared to Motorola one power mobile's 5000mah battery...

2. Camera poor not up to mark , front camera extremely bad...

3. Major issue - Network Reception fault in this m30s device , Maybe this fault hardware side , and seems like Samsung can't fix via OTA update , if your used WiFi means Good downloading speed , But Jio Airtel 4g means , Too worst , My example : I tried 4mb app from playstore , It's loading loading loading only , after few minutes it's started to downloading , And reached 98% then again loading loading only ,

4. Even Samsung not mentioned which glass protection used in this m30s , But I contacted customer care team and asked proofs , They ignored and told me Samsung not provided any official announcement like which glass used in it , But Amazon telling gorilla glass 3 , But it's not gorilla glass , Many reviewers and sites explained like dragon tail glass used in it...

5. Back panel quality too Worst , If your pressed side panel means , you will notice cracked sounds... Too poor built quality from Samsung M30s design...

6. The major issue Samsung Exynos 9611 chip one of the Exynos 7 series chip only , Samsung just named like Exynos 9 series chip , They cheated us , And so don't expect the Exynos 9 series chip's performance...

7. a ). And this device 100% not suitable for gamers , This device connected in WiFi means you will play pubg with high ultra settings ( after 25min Mobile heat melt your hand and back panel ) ,

  b).  But if your playing games via mobile network means You can't play even 10min , because it's network reception failure issue will not allow smooth gaming...

8. I hardly registered complaint , Amazon provided replacement I noticed all complaints again , so I conclude Samsung M30s all devices comes with this hardware fault , So now I got Refund from Amazon , My amount safe now...

. My only REQUEST - DON'T BUY THIS DEVICE

I am writing my review after using it for a month. Samsung did comeback into the market with lot of mid range phone and the expectations were high, I purchased this phone because of lot of positive reviews and samsung brand name as I have already used samsung phone years back, but this time i an very disappointed.
 Pros:
Amoled display
Battery life
Size and build quality.
Fast charging
Cons: Night camera is bit slow.
Portrait mode is not that effective.
Heating issue after long use (without heavy games)
And the worst part for which I have given only 1* is the network issue. There is some issue with the device as I am not getting proper network and sometimes suddenly I get edge signal for my internet where as its 4g world, I have found this issue has been highlighted on samsung forum and there is no such solution found to fix that issue.

I want to return this Mobile due to battery and camera quality performance...
So please take complaint for return
Many times i called to customer care but from that side i dint got any resolution of my return request.

Things to consider:

Display 10 it's the best!
Audio 10 both earphones and speaker sound is crystal clear!
Battery 10 6000 mah afterall.
UI 9 smooth as hell and personally I find it better than the stock on mi A3 but has no app in build app locker.
Cameras 7 not even close to the best in the price range!
I had never tried a samsung and M30s was a quite hyped so went for it. Overall a decent phone for regular use. If camera is a priority, prefer note 8 pro. One who spend a lot of time watching movies and browsing social media consider M30s. I have used realme 5 pro and bote 8 pro but the premiumness in m30s is missing there.

As a complete package its good but not great.
The camera is Excellent (5 *)
Battery backup is good, not great (4*)
Range or wifi connectivity is an issue, now its disappointing because before this handset I used to get very good sound quality over Call. But after replacing with this new handset I started getting complaints  from another caller regarding voice break. connectivity problem most of the time phone is out of coverage area.
Also, this handset takes too much time to connect to WIFI (keeps searching for almost 5 - 6 mins).

I think its missing basic phone features.

Design

Decent looks and build quality - with a a unibody polycarbonate design, and glossy finish on the back panel - quite similar to the M30 - the only major visual difference is that the triple camera setup gets a wider, rectangular module to house the LED flash and "48 megapixel" branding

The plastic body keeps the phone feeling relatively lightweight at 188 grams, which is mighty impressive for a phone packing a big 6000mAh battery

It also feels great to hold with a seamless curved panel that meets the display up front

Modern, Infinity-U front - bezels around the screen are slim, except for a slightly thick chin - you still get around 90 per cent screen-to-body ratio, which is great

Fingerprint sensor at the back is easy to reach

The power button and volumes are quite flush with the frame which means they lack that tactile, clicky feel

Lacks the premium finish of some of its competitors

Display

Gorgeous, 6.4-inch FHD+ (2340x1080) Super AMOLED Infinity-U display with excellent viewing angles, and brightness levels - easily one of the best displays in the price bracket

It also comes with "Widevine L1" certification, which helps stream content in crisp HD resolution

Blacks are deep on the AMOLED display, which looks good with Night mode enabled

Software

Samsung's OneUI is today one of the more clean, refined Android UIs that's especially well optimized for large displays like this

One UI also brings in other useful stuff, like a System-wide Night mode (which turns the background completely black, and looks great on the M30s' AMOLED display), and Always On Display option

Performance

Good, strong performance with the Exynos 9611 at the core (similar to Snapdragon 665) - everyday performance to high-end gaming - everything is handled smoothly

Camera

Decent rear camera setup - 48MP main sensor + 8MP wide-angle lens + 5MP depth sensor

With the primary lens, you get bright and attractive photos in daylight conditions with vibrant colours and good contrast - dynamic range is also wide and noise is controlled

Switching to the wide-angle lens will offer a new perspective, letting you click a wider area at close range to the subject (it is best used in daylight, however, as wide-angle captures look grainy and noise indoors or in low light)

The dedicated Night mode can be used with the main camera - it comes in handy in low-light conditions, extending the shutter time to allow more light into the frame - making for some decent low-light photos

Live Focus does a decent job at separating the subject from the background, and giving good bokeh shots

The 16MP selfie camera too does a decent job when it comes to capturing selfies outdoors under bright light (though it starts to struggle indoors and in low light, offering softer selfies with a lot of grain)

Overall, the cameras on the M30s are decent for the price bracket, even though they are not the best (that title is shared by Xiaomi and Realme phones)

Focusing is slow at times

Overall low light camera performance still feels lacking

Battery

Monster 6000mAh battery delivers an incredible 2-3 days of usage easily, making for one of the largest battery life smartphones currently available

Supports 15W fast charging

Verdict

With the M-series performing well for Samsung, M30s is well-set to add to that success, delivering a good all-round package with one key differentiator - an incredible battery life - if that is one of your primary concerns in a phone, then the M30s is a no-brainer (if on the other hand you want the best camera or best performance for your buck, you can look at Xiaomi or Realme phones in this price bracket)

I expected much from this mobile but still for Samsung in this price this phone is surprise. I Got Android Pie with One UI 1.5 along with adaptive fast charging adaptor out of the box. Let me share with you my experience;

PROS;
✓✓ Display is Super AMOLED, outdoor display brightness is better than M30,
✓✓ Ultra-wide camera is improved and captures 123 degree
✓✓ Battery is bigger enough to be compared with a battery of MacBook Pro,
✓✓ Phone is lightweight as 188gm while holding a bigger battery with capacity of 6000mAh,
✓✓ Triple camera setup includes a 48mp Samsung GM1 sensor, an 8mp ultra wide angle lens and a 5mp depth. Front camera is also 16mp,
✓✓ It does not have EIS but Super Steady mode is impressive. It can record 4K videos, Super Slow-Mo and Hyper lapse,
✓✓ Type-C port along with a 3.5mm headphone jack provided,
✓✓ Exynos 9611 octa-core chipset based on a 10nm process. Same processor has been used on Samsung A50S which is being sold at higher price by same brand. Performance is smooth and competent for playing games because Exynos 9611 is better than the Snapdragon 665 as per my experience,

CONS;
✓✓ Body is made of plastic which makes it quality inferior and does not give it a premium look like other Samsung phones,
✓✓ Front screen and Back glass are not protected like Corning Gorrila Glass so beware of losing it. (If you have enrolled for Amazon 1 year screen replacement program then fine otherwise AMOLED display replacement can cost you minimum Rs.6k)
✓✓ Processor is power consuming and Battery performance is not upto expectation, even its same almost like M30 as I compared with my brothers phone,
✓✓ 15W fast charging is slow for this giant battery,
✓✓ Small size apertures (48mp cam with an f/2.0 aperture, 5mp with an f/2.2 and 8mp with f/2.2.) capture less light through it. Result average night mode and less blurred bokeh,
✓✓ Front cam selfie lack detailing and seems smoother and Super steady mode does not work on it,
✓✓ No inscreen fingerprint sensor like Mi A3 which is earlier launched in lower range,
✓✓ NFC is no future technology and missing it in a latest phone does make it lack at some point
✓✓ Face unlock is not faster and effective
✓✓ Slo-mo video Flickers in artificial lightening

Final verdict;
As per my experience if you want to stuck with Samsung then you can go for Samsung M30 which will give you better battery backup with lighter weight and less mAh and better image quality in lesser megapixels and bigger Aperture.
And if you can go with another brand then Xiaomi A3 is an option which is more economical with better camera, inscreen fingerprint sensor and display protected by Corning Gorilla glass.

The best thing so far is the battery. I dont use it for calls that much but with whatsapp, email and maps it gives a decent approx 2 days backup now. But I hope it stays like that after 6 months because that's when most battery troubles start.
Camera is decent with decent wide angle view.
Has support for upcoming WIFI calling offered by airtel and I think this is one of the few phones in that price range that has support for this.
Screen is clear.
Backup is good but not every app like Google Maps work well as the standby seems to have a setting of its own and while navigating screen goes to standby unlike my Nokia. I don't know where is the setting to disable it. Maybe I have to use another app.
The phone has support for multiple accounts for apps like WhatsApp.
Their UI sucks and I prefer the Google stock.
The contacts sucks because in google even if you don't have the number you can search and call. Here I have to search in maps and call(its a regular phonebook kinda app). Also in stock android spammers are autodetected when call rings. This one uses some other service and its not good as google contacts.
I haven't been able to make my google fit app work. It does not detect my steps like it detected in Nokia 7.
If you don't remove the junk samsung apps you will be bombarded by marketing popups. I disabled many such apps and removed almost all samsung junk apps to make it silent.
No headphones so you have to buy or use an existing one as there is none by default.
Also by default the cancel button positions are different but you have an option to change it

I Buy it only in Rs.14299 (10% SBI Card &amp; 1000 as Amazon Pay Balance)
In this price this is awesome mobile.
Its really a Monster.
My Review on this mobile are :
Battery 10/10
Display 10/10
Back Camera 7/10
Front Camera 8/10
Look 9/10
Speaker 7/10
RAM, ROM 9/10
Processor 8/10
Charging 8/10
Fingerprint Reader 10/10
Face Lock 6/10
*No Headphone &amp; No Case Cover with this
*I think you need to buy 128GB, 6GB version. Bcoz if you click a picture by 48MP Camera its need 20/25MB Storage, means picture size will be 20-25MB

One of the finest &amp; complete Smartphone from Samsung under 15k budget. Just Loving it.

Best sAMOLED Display, High Capacity battery, 48mp Tripple Back Camera Setup, beautiful Dual Tone colour body, type C Charging port, Faster RAM &amp; Processor are thr things which make it Beast in all the way.

Samsung is now listening to people's need in budget.

*Battery easily lasts 2 full days with Moderate use and please note, it's capacity 6000mAh didn't make phone heavy, that's major point.

*Display is very crisp and bright. Angles are nice.

*Camera quality is so Nice with this price range phone. Just unbelievable.

Cons:
Charging Speed, which should have faster like other leading brands like OnePlus Warp Or Oppo Vook. As per the battery capacity We need to wait more to make full charging. My charger got dead within 1 week, So I will contact Gallery for Replacement of charger.

Samsung also should focus on UI, which must be more user friendly like OnePlus Phones.

What lacks:
1. Knox security
2. Samsung pay
3. Secured folder

Overall, this phone is really value for Money in terms of Quality, Features and Looks. Go for it.

I will make the review short and crisp.

Pros:
Wonderful display. Deep blacks and vibrant colors. AMOLED screen is really very good and better than other AMOLED screens from realme and Mi.

Superb battery. 6000mah is good enough for even hardcore users.

Cons:
Fingerprint scanner takes 2 to 4 seconds to unlock. My old phone which was cheaper than this and 4 years old was unlocking the screen in 0.5 to 1 second.

GPU is slow for supporting PIP. When we have a video playing in Amazon prime and if we press the home button, it takes 3 seconds to show PIP. My old phone used to do it in 1 second. User experience is lost.

Below average camera for this price.

When moving from landscape to portrait, it takes 2 to 3 seconds. My old phone and all Chinese brands do it in 1 second.

Phone gets incredibly hot when charging or when signal 2G/3G strength is low. When I switch to 4G only mode, the issue is resolved. The charging does cause heat in excess of 45 degrees. This may affect the longevity of this phone.

Overall I regret replacing my Realme 1 over this.

go for this phone if you have 17k
Phone camera is not good after taking photo with rear camera 48 mp when i zoom it get blur and in night mode even worst
Battery life is also medium I am avg user and in one day it drain almost 80%, also it get little heat on phone so If you are looking for performance it is not good I take photo ir takes 4-5 seconds to save photo on first day of use so you can imagine after use of 6 months how it will respond.

So think before you die.

Camera: Extremely poor.

Summary: Poor, Disappointing, not worth, only exaggerated specifications on paper. Camera,Battery,Touch: Poor, Disappointing, not worth, only exaggerated specifications on paper. Camera,Battery,Touch: POOR
I had bought this mobile with great expectation as claimed by Samsung in their specification sheet and product description, but unfortunately device is fairly disappointing at every single aspect.

I have already requested to return the product.
Got call from Amazon that their expert will come and inspect the device.
He came and checked, now waiting for next step from Amazon

Don't expect such quality product at price of 17000 INR.
There are much better options available in the market at this price.
Before purchase of this mobile I was using Redmi 4a, which was much cheaper and was launched in 3-4 years back and with not so much hyped specifications. Even performance of my old mobile was far better as compared to this 2019 product of Samsung.

Camera: Extremely poor.
Samsung says it has main camera (Auto Focus) 48.0 MP + 8.0 MP + 5.0 MP and front camera 16.0 MP.
No way it clicks 48 MP photos, not even 8 MP, front camera is also disappointing against 16MP .
No sharpness, completely blur, dusty/foggy photos, no clarity and out of focus photos and video.
Don't expect even a decent photo in low light.

*Mainly when making a video call (WhatsApp etc), if you switch to main/rear camera then called party gets video quality like 5 MP camera or like webcam which we were using 5-10 years back. It is blur, dusty, out of focus, freezing video (not that wifi used was very decent). Sometimes it works normal as well but rarely.

Don't know if it is hardware problem or software but it is there for sure.
In reviews I found some people already facing issue like I am facing with camera, same observation, same results.
In reviews I found some people praising its camera but may be it is problem with some lot of manufacturing.

Display - same as used in Samsung flagship phones
Camera - more than enough for superb photos
Battery - that's why it's called monster, just 10% consumption after 10 hours of normal millenial usage
Looks great,  feels premium.
Overall great buy at this price.

Overall features, look, performance are up to the mark. But camera result has disappointed me. When you start zoom in, image gets faded. If you are camera conscious than don't go for it now. But i think it would be sorted out in future once Samsung company provide update its OS.

A little bit heavy
Camera is not auto focus
No option for manually set the different resolution for still image
No Macro lense
Cant easily focus o small objects
No gorilla glass protection
Very slippery body lack of good grip
Fast charger is only 15 watt thats why it tooks more than 2.30 hours for full charge
it should have 25 watt for 6k mAh battery
Lots of essential and basic options and features are missing in software like
We can not set Data limit for a hotspot connection
Not showing Speed of a wifi connection
Notification led is missing
Speaker volume gets as low as half if we press volume minus for only once,
sounds good only when it is set at the highest level
There is no Trace of dolby sound even if this feature is on or off,
There is lots of customising features are missing in camera settings
It has dedicated card slot but
There is no seprate try for memory card so we cannot change or insert memory card without losing cellular network,
A protective case screen guard and Headset is also missing with this unit which is very common to come along with every brand or model,,

Samsung M30s - The Monstrous Mobile with a huge 6000 mAh Battery...

DESIGN - Nicely Built handset with curve edges and sleek design. Nowhere you would feel the presence of the 6000mAh Battery as it is light in weight and gives you better grip.

DISPLAY - This is where the Samsung phones supersede every other brand in the market. What would you see when you first hold any phone in your hand? It is obviously the display.. This M30s has the Gorgeous 6.4" FHD+ sAmoled screen with 403 PPI density.. Amazing clarity and vibrant colors and crisp sharpness. Watching videos or any sort of media consumption is a treat to your eyes. you would not feel like taking your eyes off of this display.. No words to describe the richness and quality of this sAmoled display

BATTERY - Monstrous 6000 mAh Battery that supports Quick Charge. 15W Fast charger included in the box

HARDWARE - Newest Exynos 9611 chipset that helps perform the tasks in super speed  |  64Gb Ultra fast UFS 2.1 Storage - Apps open in a fraction of a second  |  4GB LPDDR4 RAM helps perform the tasks more efficiently. This phone also supports an expandable storage of up to 512 GB through the Miro SD slot.

CAMERA - This is where the phone lacks behind the other competitors. the phone takes pictures in 12 MP by default. 48 MP mode can be enabled. However, there is no difference between 12MP default mode and 48MP pictures. the selfie shooter is a big disappointment. This is the first phone to disappoint us with its such a worst camera. Expecting that Samsung has already noted the complaints and will release an update to fix this camera issue.

VERDICT - One Word - Go for it... If you are looking for a Huge battery and a gorgeous display with average camera, then this is it for you.. If you are a Camera freak then please look for a different option. At least, until Samsung releases update to fix camera quality issue.

Changed from an Asus Zenfone max 2 to this Samsung M30s for a bigger and better battery life.

I think it is one of the best phone is its price bracket, I bought it in the launch of the phone and with great deals the effective price to me was Rs 12500,
Next I will talk my thoughts about the pros and cons of the phone after 2 months of usage
The Pros:
First and foremost reason for opting the phone was the 6000 Mah battery life and after using it for almost 2 months, I must say no other phones comes close to this one.
I am a very heavy user and use the phone for a lot of calling, reading and videos and still there is around 20 to 30% battery left at the end of the day, even phone priced at around 30k to 50k which are more premium cannot match it.
I have used the Asus zenfone max 2 with a 5000 mah battery but that phone also fails to last for the whole day with heavy usage
Secondly I would say the camera as it takes excellent photos in day light and interestingly night shot also are great and in video mode it has the ultra slow motion which is just too good and I think at this price range it just fantastic
I have not tried 4k videos but it does support the same
Thirdly the Display, the amoled screen is superb to watch content from Neftlix, Zee 5, Alt Balaji, etc. It can play HD videos too and supports the wide vine L1 which is not there in some of the phone in this price range
Fourthly the phones weight is very evenly distributed so you don't feel it very heavy in your pocket and hands.
Fifth the build quality of the phone is Sturdy and feels solid in your hands the textured colors are great too.
Smaller thing like important thing ear price volume, speaker volume is just great, also the volume in the bluetooth headsets are much better than redmi and Asus phone as I have used them in the past, which is a huge plus.
Fingerprint scanner is fast too

The single and only con I did find is that the network reception is weak as there are call drops because of the network reception, I am saying so because i have an LG, Vivo and Asus phone with me along with this one and the network reception in Vivo particularly is very good
I think samsung can make it better with an update and I hope they bring it soon.

Overall very happy and satisfied with handset.

First of all I would like to thank Amazon for the quick delivery of the product. I purchased many products online but never felt like I am cheated. Just like many people do, I researched a lot and opted for this mobile. Think I havent researched properly. I was in the confusion whether to go for redmi note 8 pro or M30s. I chose M30s because of SAR value. Samsung mobiles has very low SAR value compared to other mobiles. And also I used Samsung Galaxy and j7 nxt before. That makes me to go for M30s.
First I'll tell the pros,
1. Good display
2. Good battery life
3. Overall product quality also good

Now the cons,
Camera - I dont know why they advertised as 48MP camera. To be honest its not even 8MP. Which means Samsung wrongly advertised their product? Now just imagine how the front camera would be. The main reason why I went for  M30s is for camera and the brand, Samsung has a brand value. Now I feel like I wont trust Samsung again. I was also using Motorolo X Play, nearly 5 year old product, it has 21 MP rear camera which is way better than M30s camera. Is Samsung trying to cheat us with their wrong advertisement.
During my research online I saw mixed reviews for camera quality. I learned camera quality was not upto the mark. I thought its not the best but it would be good. But very worst camera quality. This mobile not worth the money. One of my friend bought Infinix S5 for 8000, i never heard of that brand before but that has very good camera quality. The reputed Samsung doesnt. Will future updates make the camera better?? Nobody knows.
So, if you think of buying M30s for 48 MP, my suggestion is, dont waste your money on this crap.

I purchased mobile only because of big battery but actually it's fake.  Battery doesn't last more than one day with normal usage.  Battery is very poor.
Even I am facing some problem regarding phone calls. Most of the time the reciever can't hear my voice.
I want a refund.

****************Update after 3month of use:**************
=====================================================

Battery is responding very well, living upto the mark of 6000mAh.
Fingerprint unlock is started showing the colors, fails 7/10 attempts.

facing unusual system restart issue. phone accidentally restarts midnight (plz note i have set the restart option UNCHECKED only optimization is turned ON.)
reported this to samsung and they sent me a full page dignosis instructions.

Camera is just for namesake 48MP as this 48MP works only for 3:4 ratio setting and not for full screen option.
Also even with 48Mp pics are not that great, color reproduction is good but doesnt do much.

online content(amazon prime, netflix etc) viewing experience stands out, battery consumtion is linear doesnt drop suddenly.

Mobile nework reception is poor sometimes. same carrier, different handset on same location..mine was gone or single bar whereas other one doing crisp clear.

================================
Update After Weeks use:
=============================

Camera is just average, 48Mp sounds good on product description only.

Samsung Skin lacks many good features (at least i miss much of my Honor EMUI features) like:
Using Fingerprint for clicking selfie
blocking spam message sender (like AX-Soft, IM-Loans etc). This was again pretty easy with Honor UI.
Photo filters variety is not enough (this is not a big think as 3rd party apps or even Instagram has more than enough) but inbuilt would be a good deal.

disconnecting call lags for 2secs, sometimes i wonder if call is disconnected really or not.
Fingerprint sensor is not quick enough. (again comparing with Honor)

faced lock screen google Ads issue, got it sorted but that was kind of turn off.

RAM management can be better, i see 1.2-1,4 free RAM only out of 4GB (500MB shows reserved though) also this doesnt hanged ever till now.

SloMo video can be of only 2-3 secs length (i might be missing some tricks, but could nt find on google either)

Battery backup is decent, easily lasts 1.5 day with normal usage (am not a gamer)

Superfast delivery by Amazon, full marks.
(Please note, its not even 24hrs complete to my use)

Display is amazing but there is not much like 48MP for Camera, my old Honor 7x used to click similar or better clicks.

Facing a big issue of mobile network Connectivity, had to restart my phone frequently for carrier network to catch it, dont know whats the problem. After 4-5 restart and reset network finally it has started working.

Fingerprint sensor is not quick enough, again my Honor7x was faster than this.

The nig claim abt battery holds good for now, consumption is quite gradual wrt use, so good for now, but Fast charger is not fast enough compared to the size of 6k mAh and time it takes to make it 100%

Initial setup, Galaxy store gave me headache by installing apps which are popular (i absolutely didn't want any of them).

Design is good, imp there is dedicated sim slot, (not hybrid).

Low on phone speakers output, have missed few calls though on loud and vibrate mode.
Didnt see inbuilt AppLock (as it is found in most of other handsets. can download from playstore but inbuilt would be good)
Light weight it is, doesnt feel like 6k mAh batter phone.

Seen many cool settings inside, (yet to explore all)

Will update this review after a week.

For now, its good to go at this price and on this festival sale.

If Planning to buy Samsung M30s, read this review:
Ordered M30s in first sale, using it extensively.

*Pro's:
- Powerful battery backup.
- Super Amoled display looks beautiful.
- 3.5mm headphone jack,  type- c port.
- Enabling Dolby Atmos enhances your music experience.
- Dedicated memory card slot.
- Widevine L1 certification: you can stream HD content from Netflix /Prime.

*Cons:
- Exynos processes- so there won't be much XDA community support like Redmi, OnePlus devices, so you will not gonna get custom roms, incase you want it.
Exynos 9611 gives somewhat similar performance to Snapdragon 665.
- Face unlock is not very fast, in low light it struggles to unlock.
- Selfie camera is not good, it's average.
- No display protection.
- Lags when multitasking, switching from one app to another.

Battery: 5/5
Display: 5/5
Camera: 4/5
Performance: 3/5
Value for Money: 3/5

@DISPLAY:
- 6.4 inch Super AMOLED display looks very impressive. Have 1080p resolution.

@BATTERY: 6000 mAh battery gives great battery backup, it easily lasts for almost 2 days on light usage.
- Incase of heavy usage, it lasts for 1 day, with some juice left in it. Even with 6000 mAh battery, phone doesn't feel much heavy

- It takes around 3 hours to charge mobile fully from 0 to 100.

@PERFOMRMANCE:
With Exynos 9611 SoC,  gaming experience is good, not best.
- In PUBG with highest graphics settings, there's frame drop problem.

@CAMERA:
- In normal light conditions, M30s clicks good pics, but in real life world there's no difference between 12 MP and 48 MP Camera. 48 MP is just a marketing gimmick.
- Supports 4k video recording without video stabilization.
- It also offers super slow-motion video recordings.

Verdict:
Samsung M30s is great device, but not the best at this price.
If battery is not only your priority &amp; want some amazing performance better go for Realme XT,  Poco F1, Realme 5 Pro.

I paid 15000 something during the great Indian sale.

For the price, this is the only phone right now (comparing mi, redmi, oppo, vivo and other brands) with such excellent features.

Camera : Amazing quality. For those of you who have doubts on the camera, check out the pictures. For spending 15k, you couldn't get a better deal.

Battery life : at 6000Mah I charge it once a day and it works for a day and a half with atleast minimum 7-8 hours of screen use.

Sound : The music was so loud that my opposite neighbor requested to turn the volume down :)

Screen : The resolution is amazing.

Security: The fingerprint sensor is sensitive and works very well.

Interface : Smooth as jelly. I've downloaded apps,updated stuff, while reading documents and playing music. It's working more than optimally.

It has a earphone Jack (No earphones provided in the phone box accessory. No biggie though)

It is a bit heavy but for the features the phone has, it's comparatively light.

And the colour is so pretty! A simple transparent cover and the phone looks sexy af.

Do not be afraid to purchase it from Amazon. The delivery is simply great and secure.

Samsung with their new series of exynos 10nm category processors which are much better optimised is there in this M30s. And for this pricing its a killer phone, totally vfm. I bought this for my dad, who uses it for youtube, web surfing, mails and camera. That 6000mah battery is massive. Due to that only downside is weight, but you get used to it. The battery lasts mire than 2 days on a single full charge. The fast charger takes care of getting it charged quick enough. The display being samoled is impressive. The camera is also awesome, but disappoints only when you zoom in too much, it tends to pixelate. The phone processing unit is fast and smooth with no lags at all. There's no complaint about fit, finish and quality of the phone. The colour scheme is impressive. The 6gb variant for 17k is reasonable. And the Samsung's one UI is well optimised for performance. Fingerprint speed is decent, but the face unlock is superfast. I did play cod and pubg to test it, and surprisingly it runs great with no issues at all and very less heating.

Important question why samsung over xiaomi or other Chinese brands

There's a term SAR, which indicates the radiation emitted by phones. And samsung phone scores the lowest sar compared to the Chinese ones. I dont have any personal issues with chinese brands, their phones are impressive with great features but Samsung does the job very well too.

Bought it the very next day of its launch.
It's been 4 days of usage. And here are my experiences in the form of Pros and Cons.
PROS
1. Awesome battery: Being a blogger and bookstagrammer,I need to stay online through out the day and the battery of this smartphone has been outstanding...was almost 70% even after rigorous use.
2.No heating problem...touchwood.
3.Loved the saphhire blue color and finish.
4.Convenient and comfortable grip,gives a nice feel.
5. Good display: provides a rich,full screen display.
6.Good Dolby Sound: Being a music lover,I prefer listening music while working for my blog and have always loved the sound system of Samsung smartophones and I'm satisfied this time too.
7. Great front and triple rear camera at Rs13999: It's camera was the main reason for me purchasing it as I needed a good camera phone for my blogging and I'm satisfied...ofcourse don't expect DSLR effect in your pics but yes,pics are really nice.
5.Great processor,no lags.
6.I bought the 4GB+64 GB one as I needed smartphone for blogging on the go and it is able to fulfill my blog requirements. For my personal calls,I have Samsung Galaxy C7 Pro and it has
been working brilliantly even after 18 months of purchase
6.I got Rs 1000 cashback plus Rs 500 of voucher benefits too so to me its cost was Rs12499.
CONS:
1.No LED notification,flash notification instead.
2. No earphones.
Since it's been just 4 days of usage,so I experienced these two lackings only and I'm hoping not to come across any more...keeping my fingers crossed.
Will update my review if I found anything more worth adding to it.
VERDICT: A GO FOR IT SMARTPHONE YOU WILL NEVER REGRET PURCHASING IN THIS PRICE RANGE.

I joined the hype train and purchased this phone assuming that the camera would be great but it was meant to be not. There are few other serious issues that I have this phone which is not a dealbreaker in anyways

Pros

1. The Super AMOLED display of this phone is the best in the market among all its competitors. The screen is extremely bright under direct sun and one would not any discomfort under the daylight.

2. I being a heavy mobile user get a battery life of at least 30-33 hours which is more than sufficient for any user.

3. The Exynos 9611 processor is specially designed to work with Samsung mobiles and the phone is ultrafast that you wouldn't need a 6gb ram edition at all. The phone does not lag on the UI front at any time.

4. The design of the phone is seriously overlooked by many people who are using it. Since the back panel is not a glass finish it gives an ideal grip on the phone. The sleek design makes it an easy fit in your pant pockets.

5. The phone does not heat up, unlike its Chinese competitors.

Cons

1. The biggest drawback is the signal reception of this phone. I had been using 10.or E with jio sim earlier and I used to get a speed close to 25 Mbps now in this mobile I hardly get 3 Mbps. This speed issue even affects Whatsapp. That's how bad it is.

2. The camera is a big let down considering the hype on the product page and many of the reviewers giving it a thumbs up. Under artificial lighting the camera struggles to capture the details on  human subjects and literally doesn't capture any detail from non-human subjects. The 48 MP camera is the biggest joke. When you zoom in a photo that you have taken on a 48 MP setting, the image is totally distorted. My 10-year-old Sony Digital camera with 12 MP lens takes far better shot than this mobile.

3. The fingerprint sensor is also not so great.

Verdict: If you solely rely on mobile data I would not suggest you to but this phone otherwise the phone is terrific.

The best mobile in this price range. Samsung has done it once again. I was skeptical about buying it at first and went through tons of reviews and YouTube videos before making the decision to buy this beast. The reviews were very positive so i decided to go ahead. For me, battery life and camera quality was top most priority. And M30s kills in both the areas.
Buying experience was very good and got the product delivered the very next day, thanks to amazon. First thing i noticed is the mesmerizing look of the beast. It's superb. I set up the device and next thing i observed is the display quality, which is amazing as always. Samsung is master of displays. I use this mobile as my primary device and i am more than satisfied with this purchase.
I am a medium user and play games occasionally but let me tell you, the battery life, display and graphics out perform in each area. It give me two days of battery life easily.
Camera quality is just amazing. It's Cristal clear and takes amazing pics even in low light. I used some basic modes and it was better than expectation.
Overall very satisfied all together 9.0/10.
Didn't like the plastic back, glass would have been nicer.
No earphones, at least basic was expected.
No back cover.

A Very affordable all rounder with good camera, performance and battery life along with promised android 10 update. Better than MI A3, Samsung A50, A50s.

Design 4/5
Display 5/5
Audio: 5/5
Battery: 5/5
Software 5/5
Performance: 5/5

Introduction, Design and Display:

Samsung M series is an India focused smartphone series sold my Samsung to specially cater to the likes of Indian consumers. These phones have good specs for low price, but the android OS (One UI) put in these phones is not as feature rich as A series phones. This doesn't make much difference but some features such as display modes, camera algorithms are limited as compared to A series. Furthermore this phone is listed to get android 10 (android Q) update.

The Design of the phone is nice, I bought the Pearl white variant. Keep in mind that there is NO GLASS BACK. The phone back is made out of good quality smooth plastic. White color looks really good like google pixel phones.

There is a sAMOLED FHD+ notch display in the front. A small chin at the bottom of the display. The display has really good color reproduction and high contrast ratio i.e. the black color in this phone is much much darker than black colors of LCD display phones. The colors are vibrant. You can control the color warmth and vividness. Samsung has an expertise in making displays and has been making excellent sAMOLED displays since many years (even for other smartphone companies).

Audio is also loud and clear with no sound distortion. one speaker on the bottom of phone. It has Dolby Atmos built-in for headphones.

Camera:

PLEASE UPDATE THE PHONE AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE IT.
The camera performance improved a by a lot with the latest android patch/update.
Camera photos are really good. The photos tend to be on a Colder side so either use pro mode or put on a warm builtin filter. With the latest update these issues are mostly resolved. The main Camera is of 48MP and it's really good in outdoor settings but it struggles a bit indoors. Low light photos are good. The good feature of this camera is it scales down 48MP to 12MP (i.e. there is same amount of information in 48MP and 12MP picture) thus increasing the vividness of the image, this allows it to take excellent phones even in low light condition. Wide angle camera is also very good. Depth sensor does it's work very well and edge detection in the image is also done well so that only background objects are blurred.

This phone comes with a built-in Digital Signal Processor for image processing tasks such as edge detection, scenery detection, face detection etc. This DSP is not available even in exynos 9610 processor of Samsung A50.

Battery:

Battery is a #GoMonster Feature of this phone: 6000mah. This is about 50% more than common smartphone batteries of 4000mah. This phone lasted me a around 2 days from 100 to 1 percent, with 3-4 hours of music and video streaming. You can be assured that the phone won't run out of charge at the end of day one.
There is a 15 Watt charger (Samsung Adaptive Fast Charger) provided in the box. It takes around 2.5 to 3 hours to charge the phone completely. (Older phones used to come with 10Watt charger. this charger is also 50%-40% faster than normal chargers)

Software:

One UI (Samsung's User interface on top of android) is really good and doesn't have any bugs. The performance is fast, ram management is good. Because of 6 GB ram, many apps are cached in ram according to usage patterns so there is no lag in opening apps. There is some mild bloatware which can be uninstalled or disabled. Keep in mind there are  very less Google apps preinstalled as Samsung is trying to reduce it's dependence on android. Microsoft Office Suite is preinstalled (It can be uninstalled/disabled). Apps get installed quickly. around 108GB internal storage is available to install apps. Samsung also provides a functionality to move app data to SD card to free up internal storage.

Performance:

The processor is very snappy. it gives 145256 in AnTuTu benchmark. The processor is made with 10nm Semiconductor size which reduces it's battery consumption, further improving battery life.
Gaming performance is not stellar but it's good. The GPU of Samsung processors have never been as good as Snapdragon processors, but it's above average. Arcade games like Limbo, Badland, Brawl Stars work great without any lags.

* Overall I would say go for this phone over A50, A50s, Mi A3.

Clear and strain free visual experience.
Long lasting battery
Multi tasking is smooth
Camera is good in day bright  conditions
USB OTG support
Fluid response
Large screen
Light weight with a 6000mah  battery
Overall  multimedia  powerhouse
Competitively priced.

Body is fragile and bends on pressure.

Overall a great multimedia  phone with great screen, visual display, lightweight , Samsung quality is visible  on use. A definite  recommend.

Completely satisfied,before giving it to my dad i switched from s9 to m30s for a week and i did not find any great differences in dady to day usage it was really snapy and fast samsund has done a good job with exons 9611 .on regular usage my dad takes it to 2straight days,excellent ram management,camera does al day to day jobs smoothly without any hasel,Samsung has done a great job...even with gaming it was difficult to drain the battery at the end of the day ,100%at 8am and after heavy usage which included gaming asphalt 9 and pubg ,did 4k recording as well ,if u are a heavy video editor then u may face a bit of lag and  after all this i was left with 20% at 8pm
 Battery is well optimized and weight distribution has been done extremely well build is ok as we all use phons with cases.2k higher than the market competition but its its justifiable in the name of service center's availability/coverage, brand name and quality which will help in maintaining  the resale value as well.its a really good phone.
You guys can happily buy it ther  are no issues and i forgot to talk about the display ther was no considerable difference whn i kept it next to s9 for comparison its a super amoled so no room for complaint and no need for prais dont forget to change it to vived mode and yea it took 2 hours to charge it to 90% and 20min for rest 10% last few percent always takes more time in any li-ion battery and this is no exception.
Conclusion just purchase it and don't think about a new phone for 2yrs from now if you use it carefully.

What an amazing phone by Samsung!
Firstly, 6GB/128GB for Rs15K is just an unbelievable deal!

The phone is amazing at everything. The camera is very impressive and we used it exclusively on our recent trip to Goa to capture all the shots.

It's very responsive without any lag thanks to the 6GB of RAM.

It doesn't overheat and the battery is amazing! I can watch Netflix morning to night on one charge!

The screen is amazingly bright and vivid. The speaker is decent, much better than the J series, which was their previous mid range mobile.

The M series has changed the game for the mid range phone market and competition will have to up their game to compete.

I highly recommend the M series to all my family and friends!

BATTERY IS USELESS WITHOUT QUICK CHARGE....
FOOLING PEOPLE WITH QUICKCHARGE ....

The camera quality is very low, the back cover is low quality.

And main thing is, The Body has some hollow gaps, specifically in the edge which makes button press sound when pressed.

There is a network issues, in a day 2 or 3 times has to restart or need to switch on the Flight mode to get better network.

Thank you Amazon for beautiful phone. Delivered within 24 hours. Sealed completely, assuring me its authenticity.
It is been a week I have been using Samsung Galaxy M30s my monster . I love it.
Camera: awesome,I tried in low light etc n picture quality is good.  You can see some pics I posted with macro shot,live focus option.
Battery: one time charge and I go for 2days without charging. Watched movies,surfing for long hours still good. It takes 3 hours for one complete charging.
Performance: Good. Fast n damn smooth .
Multiple apps can be opened with no lags.
The volume buttons are handy while operating in singlehand. Convient design. single hand mode is too good.
Volume is good .
Dedicated memory slot n 2 nano sim slots makes it more convenient.
I feel Sensitive of touch screen some time lags. The phone covers almost all the features. The app lock is missing though,but if u visit Samsung store n download s secure app,the job is done.
Worth buying phone. Worth every penny. Trust worthy company .
Its comparatively  best in the market than some Chinese goods. I recommend it. Go for this monster blindly .

Before I start my review I must put it on record that amazon’s after sales service to me was excellent and I think it is the best available in our country.
Now moving to the product review I don’t know if the product was a defective piece or something else but my experience was not good with the same. The cell hangs at its will and wish. Point to be noted that I never played any sort of game as I am a casual user just happy with call's, text, messages, mail &amp; You Tube. The finger print sensor is not very fast as out of 10 times it works 7 times with a little bit of delay. The face unlock feature is also not that great as it struggles to unlock the cell in dark situations and not as good as available with other competitors. In nut shell what ever the product may be the service of Amazon is excellent and they have accepted my return request with the cell and there by refunded my money to my account. This is what I feel should be after sales service. Keep it up dear Amazon.

I am Samsung using samsung phones from the year 2011. This is my 4th samsung phone. I am the guy who does not changes his phone in 3 to 4 months. So I observed the market, phones with good features and price fits my pocket. I shortlisted 3 phone 1. M30s, 2. Realme xt, 3. Vivo z1x. Last 2 phones have higher prices than M30S. Keeping that in mind, i compared features on internet and on youtube i found that Samsung is more reliable and most trusted brand. So I purchased samsung. Here are my takeaways.
Pros.
1. Excellent battery life.
2. Excellent screen. Its Amoled.
3. Processor is Exynos 9611 based on 10 nm. It is quite fast and you can do multitasking easily.
4. Fingerprint sensor is not fastest but not so laggy. It is fast enough.
5. Weight balance is excellent. You will not feel it has 6000mah battery.
Cons.
1. Camera performance is decent. Not looks like 48 mp. The aperture is f 2.0. If you want to take 48 mp photos you have to set that from canera app. Front cam is also decent.
2. I m not a hard core gamer. So haven't tried  Pubg or any games. So i can tell you about that experience.
3. You can't handle it with one hand while texting. The screen is big, so you have to be careful about that.
Also i have got 10% cashback on card and 1000 amazon offer. So i think it is decent purchase. Got it for around 11600.

The worst phone I have ever owned. Was pressured by some people to buy cheap garbage. Otherwise I wouldn't have touched it by a bargepole. There is no way you can turn HDR on or off. All the cameras are mediocre, especially the wide-angle one which distorts every image. GPS doesn't work without mobile connectivity which means the phone is useless for hiking etc. The fingerprint reader is in the back and doesn't easily recognise the print. The facial recognition is subpar. The user experience is extremely bad. For instance, if you need to copy a phone number from the call log, there is a long, unintuitive process to do so unlike a Xiaomi phone where it's a one-click process. Then dialling that copied number would be another long, unintuitive process unlike Xiaomi where it would know already that you want to dial the number you just copied and hence only require one tap. I wish I had one good thing to say about the phone. Maybe the battery or the screen but there are many phones with that. Samsung is the next Sony of smartphones, ie dead but trying to show that it's alive due to sheer arrogance. Chinese phone manufacturers will dominate the world, sadly. So long Samsung! This is the third time I am disappointed with your phones.

Purchased this on 28th and was delivered on 29th. Very quick delivery.

The screen and battery are awesome. The phone doesn't seem too much heavy. Weight is very well (&amp; evenly) distributed across the body.
Charging cable is a bit short but it's manageable. It takes around 2.5 hr to charge from 5 to 100%.

Sound is good when watching videos and playing music. You can also delete the company loaded apps like galaxy browser and free up a bit more space.

Overall for around 12K this is a great deal. Highly recommend.

Serious network issue. Don't think of purchasing it if your area have moderate signal quality as shown on other phones.
The phone is having problem in video call using the default dialler app.
Coins
Network reception power too low to work.
Camera have actually 12 megapixel sensor. I have tested it with multiple app downloaded from play store.
Pro
Good battery backup.
The Samsung UI don't have ads.
The 12 megapixel camera show good performance in low light condition.

Purchase the phone only if your area has very very good network coverage. Otherwise you have to use the phone over Wi-Fi only.

Pic any phone in the mid range segment and samsung m30s will beat it simply because super screen, amoled deep blacks with viewable angles, quality battery I use everything on from bluetooth to always on display still I get 15to 20 balance battery last,  and gaming in normal mode superb, processing and multitasking superb, I just love this phone thanks......to samsung making it. The best thing about this phone is the rich UI and superb battery....I watch 7 hours continuous  netflix with phone call recieving fantastic . Secondly games and multitasking  is as smooth as butter on toasted bread. If you king of wanna feel it try it companies rom is so mingled with the phone that everything works smooth no lag no stuck simple rule keep going flawlessly. I never had opinion  like this before for samsung but now after m30s I say samsung is rocking the roots of 15k mobiles .....fantastic  phone.

You can easily get better processor in this price range from xiaomi and realme. But you won't get the satisfaction of after sales service from those brands. Samsung only has largest numbers of service centres throughout India. Coming to that product, the highlight is massive 6000 mah battery. Yes it does it job pretty cool. One UI is buttery smooth. Like other midrange smartphones these also come with 48Mp main camera which is just a gimmick. Because you cannot click HDR photos in 48 Mp! So you have to lower the mp count. I request all the smartphone companies to provide lower aperture instead of higher megapixel count. Day to day task is easy and smooth! No lags. M30s will get quarterly update(each one after 3 months), now it is on August update. There is no issue regarding network connectivity and speed. Speaker and earpiece is good. Super Amoled Screen is just awesome. Great visibility in indoor and outdoor. Overall a great product.

The processor is slower than snapdragon 712.. causes lag on fingerprint scan and while opening some heavy apps or switching between the apps.. build quality is a bit average.. camera quality is not as good as u expect even in 48 mp image, overall i would say that camera is okayish nd not even good.. low light performance is good.., The UI is bad.. THE ONLY HIGHLIGHT IS THE BATTERY.. 6000mah.. Thats insanely long..
BUY ONLY IF U ARE GETTING IT AT CONSIDERABLE DISCOUNTED RATE and IF U HAVE A LONG BATTERY LIFE AS YOUR PRIME FOCUS.. and rest phone is just average.. apart from battery nothing too good about it

This day 1 review of  the phone about the look and feel only.I bought the opal black 4gb variant and was delivered yesterday. To my surprise the marketing team has done a fantastic job in promotion but it is in sharp contrast to the manufacturing.
Pros:
1. Fast Charger
2. I got it for 11500 which is suitable for this kind of phone.

Cons:
1. The phone is very heavy and bulky.
2. There is no basic phone cover available inbox.
3. Back side is prone to finger prints and scratches, so you go and buy a cover first.
4. The screen is marketed as Super AMOLED however it is HD+ at best.
5. if you compare with A70's Super AMOLED screen M30s stands nowhere (so false marketing)
6. Main camera is marked as 48MP however it is 12-16MP at best.
7. Front camera also fails to impress.
8. Added a new contact, it took 2-3 seconds for the name to appear on the contact number after being saved.
9. Read another review which said the user observed less network towers on his M30s when he was in full network coverage area as shown by other phones.
10. Point 9 is true, i also observed the less network coverage with this phone.

Overall this phone has failed to impress on almost every front.
Overall it not as per the expectations i had based on the feature mentioned for the phone.

First of all, this is a great phone at such price. Though Samsung rarely reduces price for such specs, so its like a giveaway who are hungry for more storage and speed and who dont prefer Chinese phones.

Pros
1) sAmoled display has a super silky touch response, sometimes you will feel, you didn't even touched it
2) 109 GB actual storage is what you get in this which is more than other phones .
3) Humongous battery, But charge your phone to 100% when you receive it at first, for better performance( comes with 50% battery)
4) Dual Sim DUal Voltage is new feature which distinguish it from other phones, earlier you has option for only 1 4G/3G, other Sim automatically switches to 2G. But with this feature, you can use all bandwith of 4G&lt;3G and 2G for both sims. Eg- If you have Jio Sim in one slot, then other sim will have better network because it can now connect to all 4G,3G and 2G
5) Dedicated slot for SD ( Though it will not be required)
6) Super fast delivery
Cons -

1) Camera doesn't click like its 48Mega pixel. Photo quality is not that good. Front camera also not worth the bucks.
2)A little thicker from peers
3) Quite slippery in hand, should use cautiously when not using without backcover
4) No long screenshot option, which comes in many phones now a days
5) No earphones in box
6) Usable Ram is lesser than expected

Liked the design colour and price . it has good features considering the cost . Camera quality is good. But the phone is slightly heavy considering the fact that it has 6000 mAH battery,
Delivery from Amazon excellent.

The above review was in the first week of buying the phone.
The review now is after almost a month . After installing new updates to the phone . There is a time lag in the responses and the phone hangs and after a 10 seconds all the actions that you had done earlier are carried out in sequence . This is a very scary situation where you would not be in control of your actions .
i have to take it to the authorized Samsung service centre now.  i think this was after the new updates were installed that im facing this issue

Now this is the next week after installing the new updates . There was a tremendous time lad in responses. But now after 3 days of slow repsonses my phone has started workng well . Now there is no time lag. The phone does get heated up slightly but i have noticed that the phones battery gets drained very quickly . It has fast charging but it drains also quickly . But all in all i do like the phone . Camera is okk

Samsung M30S is a beast when it comes to battery power, processing, speed and storage space. I got it just on the launch date. The Opal Black color looks very premium and the phone is aesthetically pleasing.  It has been over a week and I have been using the phone without any issues. Clicked many photos and they are simply astounding. Photos clicked outdoors have great colors captured. Photos in Night mode are also good but with visible grains. Games like Call Of Duty &amp; Pubg run smoothly without any lag and heating. The fingerprint scanner and face-unlock are quick. The OneUI is clutter-free and smooth and you also have the option to disable any Ads that might show in the notifications. The Power Mode and dark mode extends the battery juice and it lasts for one and a half-day on a single charge but I wish Samsung had provided with a 25W charger instead of 15W, as the phone takes 2 hours to get to 100% . I can recommend this phone to anyone though, as it has the latest specs, which should last long enough.

This smartphone is that good. My cheapest but best smartphone ever. Never purchased a phone under 19200 in last 11 years. Just go for 6 GB version, it will last you many years.

Update : After using it for few hours I noticed that its cameras are not that good. Flash light is very bright which is good. Selfie camera is very bad, though it is 16 MP it can't take natural photos, images get smoothened by software and there is no option to remove this filter. Chinese camera gives all kind of settings to you. Also there is no 'Private Folder' feature given, which is a very basic requirement in mid range smartphones. Back camera is OK but when zooming in captured images, it lacks details. Fast charging is not getting the advantage of inbox 15 watts fast charger.
Display is 10 out of 10.
If Samsung can tighten its software with added "Knox" features than it will be a really good mid range smartphone.

Simply put it's a well built every day use phone. It has got a good quality screen and a very reasonable camera. The battery backup is very good, not a surprise as it comes with a 6000mAh battery. It's little on the heavier side though, especially if you are used to lighter models, you will feel the difference. But I got used to it in a week or two.

The build quality is good. Much better than many phones I saw on the same price point.

On the software side, it does not come with bare-bone android which is a minus, but most of the unwanted software can be disabled easily. So not disappointed there.

Finger print reader works like a charm. Phone gets charged in few hours and did not heat up during charging or normal use. I did not play video games though.

Overall I would say it's value for money.

It looks good on the outside but the camera is v.bad not bad but the poorest.... i got this phone 26 october 2019.. I bought it after going through many reviews but I feel I m coned. V.bad picture quality. At night time the picture is really bad. Amazon should stop selling this phone. Many of us buy phone mainly because of its camera and battery life. But this time Samsung has ditched by the outer look. I want to give away this phone and want my money back. I m really frustrated. Amazon  u need to listen to me. Refund my my money. I don't want any kind of replacement.😡

All the descriptions on the Amazon site is accurate so can see the specifications. I have got the 128GB/6 GB RAM with sapphire blue variation. The outlook of the phone is very attractive. Now coming to the features I liked about the phone.

1. Display: The phone comes with a vibrant samoled pannel which has a great true color rendering capability.

2. Processor: The process is really fast enough for multitasking and no lag what so ever while opening a big file or playing a 4K video. But I have not tasted for any gaming performance.

3. UI: The custom UI made by Samsung is just super fluid and loaded with lots of features like Processor control, simultaneous Multi audio mode in different devices, camera interface and many more.

4. Camera: In this budget this device has got really very good optical sensors/camera. Wide angle lense is a very good addition. Low light performance is up to the level .

5. Battery: As you know it has 6000 mAh battery, which lasts one and half day for me with about 9h screen on time. With the fast charger you can full the battery from empty to full in about 3h.

6. Sensors: The gyroscope, GPS and magnetic field sensors works flawlessly. It could lock the GPS in few seconds.

7. It comes with two sim cards and one separate sd card slot, no hybrid! That's a great plus. Both sim cards support 4G volte simultaneously.

Now the things which I don't like

1. The display doesn't have a gorilla glass protection.

2. There is no notification LED

A good phone at this cost. I have a 6GB RAM one and while there are no major complaints there are still some nagging issues. Firstly, the pros: battery is a great advantage, so is display, it's very clear &amp; bright, camera is pretty good too - I shifted from Poco and found this better in every way. Now the cons: screen is not Gorilla glass and I got a small crack from the phone slipping out of my pocket while I was sitting, from a height of around 2ft, phone takes a bit of time to respond to touch, fingerprint reader takes a few attempts too, camera takes a sec longer to focus, backside gets smudged very easily. It's a very good phone at this cost but is a bit slow despite the 6GB RAM, maybe snapdragon would have made a difference and needs to be cared for well.

Update after using for 3months: there is a lag when using google maps and a lot of.times navigation doesn't even start, whereas same sim in same location in another phone works fine. If you are someone who uses google maps often, avoid this phone.

I was using phone last one month..processing is not so good,there is always issue in network. 5 6 photos we can't send through WhatsApp.otherwise u have to restart phone (I tried with both mobile data and wifi)...so problem is in 0hone only not network issue...
 Display is good,photos r also good,but in night mode photo r not so good ,what they are promising.

Battery backup is also  not so good.
This is not so user friendly like redmi.
Ha the charging is very fast...
Look wise it's good.
But in same price u will get better option..
I bought bcoz of samsung brand but very much disappointed..dont go with it....
Again n again it is getting hang and in a month I restarted more than 100 times..

I usually won't write reviews other than the ratings, however, this time I need to share my issues facing with this phone in 3 days of usage.

1. Pathetic and very bad reception both indoor &amp; outdoor. Both sim with airtel.
2. No internet due to point# 1
3. High lagging due to point# 2
4. Battery on an average takes 3 hours minimum to reach 100%

I reached Amazon customer care, did some troubleshooting, but nothing worked. Though we have an option to replace, they don't agree to it. They guide me to reach Samsung service center. Why should go to service center with a brand new phone:(..

I regret so much with this buy and the service provided by Amazon.

Not sure what should I do now..

Ordered on 29th Sept and rec'd on 1st oct.

Sheer waste of money. Either they have limited the capacity of mobile by software degradation or they are faking on specifications.

Build: extremely extremely poor, thick plastic brick in your hand. Even though my redmi go had plastic body but it's fitting was good. In this device there is some cRackling noise.

Battery: don't know why but just 1hr of youtube resulted in 17% drain. Didn't expected this from 6000 mah battery and super amoled Screen.

Camera: 48mp rear camera was not able to produce clear image from a distance of 01 meter. Pro mode doesn't have control on shutter speed, no manual zoom option.

I read a lot of reviews and watched 10-15 youtube videos before buying this.
At a price of Rs.11600 (Cashback SBI + Amazon Pay 1000) this is a blind buy choice.
Pros:
1. L1 certified ( Netlflix and Amazon Prime support FHD )
2. Super Amoled
3. 6000mah battery
4. Decent Camera
5. Nice processor and UI no lags
6. Samsung After sales support

Cons:
1. No notification light ( you may use always-on display)
2. Low light Camera not so good.
3. Camera focus laggy
4. No NFC and No Samsung Pay and No Knox support

Overall, for a user like me who doesn't play games, this is amazing option 4gb ram variant one can expand the memory with SD card if required. Opal Back looks very good to buy that color.
If you have to build concerns, this is a plastic build body phone. One can use a good quality tempered glass and a good phone cover.

A very good phone by samsung , i replaced my phone after 5 years of using the samsung galaxy grand duos ... This phone is really good the audio is clear although i am having some network issues , my moms phone (honor 6x) has better jio signal than my phone in the same room at same place so there is definitely some issues with network... On the screen shot u can see -103dbm (lower -dbm = better signal) &amp; my moms phone is getting -97dbm which is stronger so i am getting 6mb/sec download and she is getting 10mb/sec download speed on speed test...  Also the battery life isn't as good as i would have thought by the 6000mah mark... It gives me around 8hrs of screen on time ... Which is good enough i never completely discharge my phone... I put it to charge when its near 13% and take it off at 80% that way the battery lasts much longer...

In simple one line, best mobile in this price range if you can compromise at Camera.

Go through detailed review in below mail.

Did lot of research between available mobiles in this price bracket and finally zeroed at RealmeXT and Samsung Galaxy M30s. Finally gone with Samsung M30s considering value for money and price range.

 - I have used Redmi Note 3 before this mobile from last 3 years. Seriously scared of Samsung OS when choosing this mobile. Believe me, Samsung improved a lot with their OneUI and lot of customisations but still lack few customisable features compared to MIUI.

- Superb battery and awesome super amoled display. Back side cover was cheap in terms of quality but looks wise superb. I have gone with Blue + Green combo and looks awesome.

- Recently, Samsung removed support for different fonts due to regulatory from Google from pie version. They have given very few fonts and asking to buy from Galaxy store for more fonts. Seriously disappointed with this step from Samsung and not at all expected.

- Lot of options in Camera i.e. slow motion, super slow motion, hyperlapse, live focus, Ultra wide etc. but coming to overall performance of the camera, its disappointing and not as expected. Samsung should seriously take this and push an update to improve cam quality. Selfies looks pathetic with artificial looks.

- Full charge of battery takes 2:30 hours of time with 15W fast charger. Samsung should provided atleast 20W fast charger considering 6000MAH Battery.

- Super Amoled FHD Screen looks just awesome and yummy. Eye treat to see color reproduction and brightness. Provided inbuilt night mode also, but it works with only default theme and can't apply if you are using any other theme. Always on display was good and handy if you just want to see glimpse of on whats going on at your phone.

- Provided charging cable was very short and in pathetic quality. Looks like it will torn out within month and better to buy Type C extended cable from a good brand like boat for spare.

- OneUI was good but needs some more optimization and customization to get max yield. It lacks few basic options like removing vibration for notification alerts.

- This devise was on quarterly update list from Samsung and needs to wait bit longer for updates.

- Lot of bloatware from Samsung and can be uninstalled few apps. Not understood on what logic they added Facebook into us and can't even disable also.

- Back panel was very poor quality plastic and can break easily if you drop. Also some kind of rattling sound if you press on sides. Understood from Samsung Members app that most of the people has this issue and this is a manufacturing defect.

- Overall satisfied with device and bang for bucks, if you can compromise at Cam and build quality.

5* excellent phone.Bought 128GB, 6 gb ram version. I had a redmi 4 pro earlier. Used it for 2 years. But with new apps and new requirements, i felt that it couldnt keep up the pace. I bought the phone thinking that, atleast for next 2-3 years i could use it with the amount of RAM, power and storage space it has. I am not a person who would like to change phone every year. After a lot of thought and reviewes, bought my first samsung phone. First thing i should comment is for is its display. Awesome display,camera quality too is excellent for a normal user like me. Excellent battery capacity,very fast as well.Touch sensitivity and adaptive display in various lighting conditions
 too is super. I normally use a lots of day to day apps, socialmedia, view netflix/ amazon prime videos etc,lots of browsing, hear songs etc, i use two sims as well. It is almost one month since i bought this phone. Never had any heating issue. I had a bit of apprehension to go for a phone above 6 inch display as i thought it would be oversized for my hand to hold. I thought i liked a smaller sized phone. But i am fine now, the difference in viewing videos on a bigger display is awsome i feel now. Only draw back some may say is about its plastic body. Believe me, it doesnt matter for me once i had a good phone cover. Its a loss if you dont buy this phone if you think it dont have a metal body or a glass black cover. I dont find any drawbacks as of yet. So giving it 5*.

Excellent phone.
The battery is literally monstrous as it doesn't drain completely even after 48 hrs of usage.
It recharges from 18 to 100% in just 4hr.
The camera is also very good and it has a lot of functions same as a DSLR.
It's been a long time Samsung has introduced a very good package in this budget.
Voice quality is up to the mark and the processor exynos does its work efficiently and the phone doesn't lag at all.
I haven't use it for gaming as I m not a game lover.
The feel and the colour is very premium and u will definitely love this phone.
I m reviewing after a wk usage.
Bought 2 phones at a time from 2 different IDs.
Amazon has a great packaging method to ensure safe delivery.
Hats off to u guys for that.

I was pleasantly surprised how good the phone is, considering it's price bracket. The display was what really drew me to the m series....the sAMOLED is just so amazing and coupled with this monster battery it permits you to work carefree. I bought the black version, the outer shell isn't great but acceptable, I always use a protective cover so it didn't bother me. I don't play games on my phone so can't comment on that, but felt the performance more than apt for routine functions. The fingerprint scanner isn't an on screen one, but I personally prefer the rear scanner to an in display one.
The flphone gave me 2 full days of moderate use and w and a half days of light use.

Overall I feel extremely  satisfied with my purchase on the fact that I got a great phone for a very reasonable price and cause I don't have to keep running for a charging point every day.

Well 10 days I have been using this phone, I say its good, not great or amazing just good. Screen and battery are its main selling point. Amoled display and 6000 mah battery makes this phone look amazing, but its processor and 12 MP, not 48 MP sensor and plastic built are not up to its mark regarding  the competition. Gaming is not great at all, I used to a play a game called crowd city and it doesn't run great. But ONE UI is amazing and one of the best I have ever used, I used MI UI and stock android, it's the best.
If u just want good looking screen and do not play games, it's good for u.
Battery optimization  is not great I am a power user and i charge my phone daily and charging takes some time(2.5 hrs) to be precise from 0 to 100 %.
Finally if u are going to drop your phone on a regular basis or accidentally I request not to buy this phone because amoled screen  is very delicate and it doesn't work(screen damage) if it's dropped even from your pocket height and it costs 6k for the screen.
The screen is gorilla glass 3, my phone got 2 little holes in screen, so if u buy before using buy a screen guard and hard case first.

Excellent features. Absolutely a beast.  I am enjoying all the way. Flagship mobile features In this price segment.
 Just blindly go for it.
Camera: The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots. Additional zoom-out features for both front and rear camera is nice to have. Select 48 MP in camera mode to take a beautiful picture

Battery: I am really happy with the monster battery. I am not a heavy gamer. But professionally  use GPS heavily. Backup  lasts up to approx 2 days. Yes, approx 48 hours with good usage of WiFi and GPS. Gyro and Magnetic sensors are awesome.

Design, Touch, Look &amp; Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light.

The face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock. The processing speed is good enough for heavy games without much heating effect.

Grab It , Use it and enjoy.........

I have been using the Nokia N8 before I bought my first Android Phone i.e. Samsung M30s. I bought this phone because I was bored with regular companies like Xiaomi, RealMe. If there were good Nokia phones, I'd have bought it. Talking about the phone, the key features I liked are

1. AMO - LED Display *makes a difference* - My phone shines apart even in front of Redmi Note 8 Pro.
2. Adjustable transition timings - You can change the transition timings for animations in the phone from developer options and trust me it will make your phone look so smooth.
3. Decent Camera - I liked the camera. It captures great photos. Also, there's slo-mo and ultra slo-mo.
4. PUBG runs alright. I won't say it runs 100% smooth. But the gameplay is OK.

I guess, expected a lot out of this phone. Big battery and screen is the only positive about this phone. Rest is okayish.

Phone does hang even though I am not a gamer and never installed a single game on this device.

I don't know if it is an issue but my tower signal strength is always 2 or 1 lines. I never saw full signal strength on my device. I read on forums and got to know that everyone is facing this issue.

Camera quality(both front and back) is pathetic in indoor lighting and night. Focusing is a big problem with the phone.

Fingerprint is very unresponsive if there is a little sweat on your finger or a little dirt on the scanner it won't accept your fingerprint. But sometimes it does accept. So I don't know what is the issue with it.

Very delicate phone. Drop it once and your screen is dead( happened with a friend but thankfully he bought 1 year screen replacement with the device. Mind it he was using a good back cover and a screen guard, still!)

Processing is slow. Apps take time to open( Milli secs more but u cn feel the difference if you have used a high end phone with good processor)

Talking about the body. Don't even get me started. Cheap plastic back which presses and make clicking sound as if it was not perfectly fitted. The fingerprint scanner was not fitted perfectly. Had to visit the service centre to get it placed correctly.

Instead of returning the phone I decided to live with clicking sound near the power button and sim tray.Actually I discovered all this after my return period was over :"(

I would suggest you to go for some other phone if you are not running for big battery life.

Love the display on Super Amoled screen, camera is good for selfies and group photos,  but if you want to take micro focus pictures then you could be disappointed, a big battery but did not see much difference in terms on endurance.  My battery usage come almost same as that of old phone Lenovo K8 with 4000mh battery same set of apps being used. This is second phone that we had brought without any scheme within a 1 month of first phone.  For some reason I find the touch response bit slower than the first phone we had taken during the Launch sale.  However I decided not return the phone just for the display and picture quality.  Was little disappoint to know that display screen does not come with Gorilla glass protection, so need to get a screen guard.

I have been using iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3, S7, Galaxy Note 4 and Honor 9i. Using M30s for last 2 days. I just want to put my experience here to help others for a better buying decision, not to create bias.
Pros:
1. Screen, honestly, only one thing is good in this phone, as is in other Samsung phones as well, its screen, really good. Even though screen size is 6.4", the screen to body ratio is perfect and doesn't feel odd while holding it, with good weight distribution. 8.5/10
2. Battery, is ok, but please don't think with 6000mAh it can last for full 2 days before next charging is required. Only 1 to 1.5 days max with moderate to low use respectively. Other phones with similar specs are giving same backup with even 3400mAh battery. But I have not faced any heating issue so far while charging/playing games. 7.5/10
3. Connectivity, I have not found any issue in network, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, fingerprint scanner. I am not using Jio network. Fingerprint scanner position is little difficult to find in the starting and with phone cover, it is easy to use. 7.5/10
Cons:
1. Camera, both back and front, are the worst, I have seen in any of the phones I have used or seen with my friends. Even a 10,000/- Mi phone with 12MP camera produces better and sharp photos. There is no sharpness, no depth, slow focus in the M30s camera photos. Results are bad in low light. If your priority is camera, please DO NOT purchase this phone. Better go for Honor/Mi for the same range, you will get much much better camera results.  3/10
2. Software, One UI, is ok but is feels slow even with 6gb RAM which is strange as Honor 9i is faster even with 4gb RAM. Stock phone, message, camera, file manager apps are really basic which you use on daily basis, Samsung should improve these app at least, as these are the one to be used on day to day basis. Honor apps are much batter e.g. stock message app in 9i filters out personal and promotional messages in different tabs hence it is easy to find important messages. Multitasking etc is difficult in M30s due to strange recent apps window feature which is not similar to other Samsung phones like S7 etc. Also, out of 6gb RAM, around 2.7gb RAM is available which is by the way enough for playing any game, multitasking etc but still its less compare to other phones. Also, not sure why they have not included ultra-power save option in this phone which is readily available in all Mi, Honor phones. 6/10
3. Speaker, again mediocre quality. Dolby atoms is again gimmicks. Honor 9i produced better sound with earphone (Fiio FH1, Sony xb75ap, Sony 1000XM3). Samsung, you should at least improve the quality of these basic things, even a 10000/- phone sounds better than yours. 5/10
4. Over all build quality of phone is just ok. You have better build quality phone in same range. Samsung could have tried for a little better quality SIM tray, side buttons, fingerprint scanner, and at least sweat resistant body. Also, they should include the tempered glass and basic back cover to start with. 7/10

Samsung: You should not copy the gimmicks of other phone companies to provide the specs of 48MP camera, 6gb RAM, 6000mAh battery etc just for the sake of it. Please provide a 24MP or even 12MP camera with better results. Better software management so 4gb RAM and 4000mAh is optimized with less memory leak or battery drainage. At the end of the day, your sales will be good in first 10 days of launch and once the reviews come out, it will crash, so no point of gimmicks, only the early buyers may feel cheated; who will anyway buy from other brands next time. People are not looking for a phone just for a good screen but in this range they expect at least average quality speaker sound &amp; camera as well. Please focus on the overall quality instead of putting so much amount in marketing.

One of the best in this price range. Camera quality ok ok not bad not so great. I mean 48 mp wise not that great. Low light sensitive is good .Battery is really monstrous. With full charge it lasts about a day and a half depending upon your usage. While heavy usage i felt a little heating. No lags. Video stabilization is very good. Overall i personally am very happy with my experience with Samsung Galaxy M30s

23 Hours usage

At 9pm, 99% Battery, Mobile data4g on Hotspot on, Single sim used, no data download,
Next day morning 8.30 battery: 82%

From 8.30 to 6pm: hotspot on, 4g on, 2.5gb data downloaded, I was on call for 30 minutes, battery dropped from 82% to 15%
Watched video 30 minutes
Display was on for 8 hours

From 6pm to 8pm
4g on but  Hotspot off
30 mins on call
45 minutes watched video
Battery from 15% to 1%

Put my phone on charging (mi power bank) : 8pm to 11.10 pm
Battery from 1% to 100%

U could see my mobile usage - high and extensive, still it withstood for a day.
For a normal users who doesn't use 4g much, and doesn't use for kindle, and watch video much, the battery should last for 2-3 days.

Remaining all features are good for the price.

I purchased for my wife and it died in 2 months of use even with a military grade bumper (cover) and screen guard. Suddenly it stopped working after falling from 2 feet height inside the apartment. There was no crack or anything just display was dead. We took it to the service center since it was under warranty still, they minutely inspected and showed that there was a hairline crack inside the screen less than the size of a human nail. There was no crack on the outside screen. The mentioned that Amoled screen stops working in case of a minor crack itself and we have put the phone under a lot of pressure to have caused this and this won't be covered under warranty and replacement would cost 4700+service charges. Luckily I had bought insurance, so they are fixing it for free .. but what an experience with quality from Samsung - my One+6 has fell down like crazy on roads without a bumper protection cover and still runs like new after 1.8 years.. Not buying a Samsung again..
Even without this issue, hated the quality of camera, which was one of the hyped features for the price. You will get a better picture quality from a single lens camera with a much cheaper phone.
Lastly the UI sucks.. feels so slow inspite of the specs of the phone - I dont know if its the hardware or software which is the culprit. Only good thing is 6000mAH battery which lasts for 2 days.. but then it takes long to charge as well.
I would sincerely recommend customers to look at alternate options than to buy this phone think of triple camera w 48MP sensor or for Amoled screen..

Don't waste your money in this phone, If camera is your priority.

Camera:
Detailing on front camera image is poor.
48MP main camera image quality is average. Even a 13MP realme 3 and my old handset Xiaomi Mi4i camera can capture more clear image than this 48MP camera image.  Detailing in 16MP front camera image is just equivalent to 2MP camera image quality. Worse camera image quality of front camera image I ever seen.

Fast charger:
15watt fast charger is Only a  lollipop in the name of fast charging. It take approx 3 hours to full charge the battery from zero percent. For 6000mAh battery, Samsung should provide at least 18 watt fast charger instead of 15 watt.

Network issue: I am facing little bit of network connection issue. I don't know weather it's a software issue or poor quality hardware. I think Samsung is used a poor quality antenna in this phone.

Other than camera and network issue,
1. Battery backup is good, easily can last 2days backup.
2. Display is awesome.
3. One UI is good better than MIUI and Color OS.

I've now got to get used to these pathetic looking themes that only a deg#nerate could like. IDK what Samsung were thinking about India when they designed this thing.
The theme store is bad and most of it is paid, I'll have to get something from the play store to deal with this.

Seriously, its really bad.

On top of that the UI lacks a lot of features.
I've used an mi3 and the poco f1 before this brick and I'll list out the UI features those two old phones have that is missing in this one:

Can not run two apps on the same screen real estate. Yup! You can't have a minimized youtube playing while reading the news, how pathetic.

Select next song by shaking the phone

QR code scanner (I have a long password for my wifi and guess how thrilled I was to find that I had to type it out in this phone instead of simply scanning the qr code from my previous phone)

Click on power button when flashlight is on to turn it off

(This is a hardware feature more than a UI thing)Turn on mobile hotspot while wifi is on and connected to router
(My mi3 also had a much longer wifi transmission range than this junk)
No notification light

Three finger screenshot, here on this Samsung you have to swipe your palm across the display(dumbest idea ever)

Data/wifi transmission rate missing in this Samsung

(More to come)

Even the camera is a joke on this thing, the only saving grace that this device has to offer is its battery which is decent. Display looks like a cheap AMOLED display.

I never imagined that the 6000 mah had so much juice, I use both the Note10 plus and the M30s. The note needs a double charge when used extensively if I want it working for 24 hrs. This one on the other hand has two days of battery with more than extensive usage. The screen is the best within this price range. And just a tiny bit smaller than the Note10 plus. I have never regretted once buying this one as my brother suggested. It has really good build quality, feels nice to be held and top end to look at. Samsung has done a brilliant job with it. Go ahead, pick one up and you'll never regret ever. Changed 4 mid range phones from other leading brands before I settled for this one. It's a keeper !

This phone is lighter than expected.
Face recognition  is ok ok you can't open  in darkness (like in honor 9n) it won't  recognize you, should have password  or fingerprint to work in late night/darkness.
Battery  for 6000mah draws  50% in one day with 2 hrs on YouTube online and 10 calls of each 5min duration. Max it may come for one and half day on normal usage. Which is very bad.
Gamers say away not your type.
You have all the good option on phone but you can not use them as battery will drain faster.You will have two mode for charging Fast cable mode and Slow normal mode, you will get better backup in slow mode. Some system app are unnecessary some you can uninstall and some you can't.
If you use phone only for calls than this phone is good but who will buy by paying such amount just to talk.

continuously I'm using this product for the last 3 months, everything is fine except the camera ,  after taking the photo is not that clear image .when we go for zooming for that picture getting look like a blurred (or ) break.so I m not happy with this camera. even back and front both camera same result, but battery life is ok,u can use up to one full day with data on time.  middle of the time I faced some issues from the video player. when I play the video after 10 to 15 sec it's getting automatically pause and play again from resume. and I tried with another third party apps from play store like an MX player its also the same result , but finally, after some days these issues solved once I update the software.

I have been using this device for the last 17 days and my experience is really good. The battery is the main highlight of this device and it should be, it is really massive and will give you almost two and half days of battery if you are a moderate user; otherwise, you can expect one and half-day battery life. The display is stunning,it is the amoled panel and it is also power efficient. The processor exynos 9611 is a better one ; it is equivalent to QS 665. So far I have never faced any lag and it is pretty good when comes to image processing. The rear camera is better one; especially the night mode and the 48mp mode. The front camera is good enough and you can even take wide-angle photos with it. Overall it is a great package from Samsung if you do not do gaming that much; especially high graphics games. I do not have a problem with a plastic back and trust me it does not feel that bad. If you are planning to buy it then go for it without a second thought.

It took me few days to start using the phone as I was traveling...meanwhile I was reading the reviews other fellow buyers of M30S in this forum and especially those low scored reviews caught my attention.  I just want to ask you all a question how could one just give 1 star rating for this phone... ya there are some kind of draw back or touch points which does not meet one's expectations in any product... but 1 star is unwarranted.  This phone is way worthy than 3 star easily. Personally I can't ask for more for this pricing.  Its brilliant  strategy to disrupt the cluttered Chinese brands.. Good effort Samsung

It's an awesome budget mobile. The best thing is super amoled display and mammoth battery. Display is just gorgeous.. The best in class. Also OneUI is is the best interface I have seen till now. Samsung has done a tremendous job with M series. The phone is also not that heavy.. Just 188 gm and you would get used to it after a few days. Lag free perfomance. Sound quality is also good.. Loud enough to enjoy videos and music. Haven't tested dolby yet. The only thing samsung should improve is on the camera front. Selfie camera is not very good and chrome browser freezes sometimes. People should buy this if averse to user interface and spammy notifications on Mi phones. 4.5 stars for this beast.

Reviewing this after 20 days of usage so that am not biased with the initial honeymoon period.
I was ready to go for a one plus 7 at 30000 when I saw this promo and glad that I went for this. Saved a lot at same performance.

The camera in night mode is better than  my iphone 6s. Even day pictures are equal if not better than any other flagship model. Can't really understand why some people are complaining about this camera. To me it's even better that one plus or lower models of iphone.

Processor is Fast enough for all my office job. I virtually run my office on my mobile.
Not a gamer so can't comment on that.

Battery last a full 24 hrs in roaming with 40% still left.
Display quality is the best in class
Sound quality superb.

Only one point to improve is the auto adjusting screen brightness is slow to adapt.. Samsung must see how to resolve this in next software upgrade.

Overall this is a steal deal at 11300 i had to pay with my old samsung on 8 2 yrs old exchanged. This one is easily worth 20k plus and I am going to buy one more soon for the family

Excellent phone for the price paid. Real value for money. Samsung realised why they were behind Redmi and started making excellent phones for the masses &amp; millennial too. Even though OneOS is far behind Redmi MiUi in terms of the basic features, high quality hardware make the phone excellent buy over Redmi series.

Pluses : Display is fantabulous, Multitasking is butter smooth, Camera excellent especially slow motion videos &amp; battery backup unbelievable for average use(you may forget about charging as its only occasionally needed).

Minuses :  Back panel not fitted properly. Seem like all blue phones has the issue.

PS: Camera is excellent actually. Those who are complaining about camera, please go through its settings. By default it's not set to its full potential, may be for reducing file size.

Good phone by specification, many things to love about it as it's UI, colour of phone and it's premium look itself, biometric sensors are too good even face locks are improvised and works frequently even in low light.
Performance wise it's good while handling apps, multitasking and above average gaming performance.
Coming to some issues that can be improved as the front camera creates too much of noise in low light or bulb light, even some noticeable noise can be found in day light too, image processing needs some basic update as not to make every pic too smooth but the main focus must be to provide clarity and details in the image. Super steady mode of rear camera also suffers with the same noise issues, also wide angle is not that great and usually looses details while capturing.
It comes with 15 watt fast charger out of the box which also needs some upgrade as even considering its 6000 mah battery it takes longer time to charge completely.
Hoping for some software update regarding the camera department and fast charging.

Its a 17,000Rs Phone and its UI is like a budget phone. Its a sAmoled screen but its colour reproduction isnt good. The front camera has a problem giving a reddish glow to your pictures. It lacks a notification light. Build quality is good. BUT YOU CANNOT TELL A Rs17,000 phone a budget phone. You'll feel an okay budget phone in your hands. Its an average product. The icones are large and unattractive, only if you change grid size of app order, the size decreases automatically...You might need to install a 3rd party launcher. Personall I did't like the phone and I am dissapointed with the purchase as I cannot return it back. Its the battery thats good...says 6000mAh but hardware check apps shows a 5830mAh. Don' t buy if You are finding it good because of its battery. While some apps open in background and was playing pubg,  the phone suddenly froze...i had to switch it off.

Pros: In the looks department the phone is absolutely upto the mark. Storage and speed is also good. No glitch with any apps and everything runs smoothly. Audio is great and it has very less static compared to my previous phone when paired with my headphones. Touch works very well and the fingerprint reader works very well without any lag.

Cons: Eventhough the battery is 6000 mAh if you keep GPS on, it drains very quickly within 12 hours. My previous phone had 5600 mAh and would last a whole day with GPS and 4G on. Without the GPS on however the phone last a good 2 days even with the bluetooth on it stays 1.5 days.

Its very confusing for every one to choose bestest amoung the best phones ,samsung m30s is one of the bestest phones wid in the budget plus with all the features we need in day to day life , best camera quality, high speed  ,big battery life that lasts for 2 days ,i ve orderd on exchange n Mseries are the best till now compared to others,  I m really  amazed after using this ....no problem faced till now,this is my 3 day with da phone .will update if any , 1 draw back is that it gets heated up coz of the charger that has high speed charging ,other than that its perfect for the beginers who wanted a big battery life or uses phones for a long time ,u can play music for continous ,or watch ur fav shows or chat wd ur loved once u ve fingerprint as well as face rec too it quickly unlocks,n more comfortable even while driving too .highly recommended go for it

For a Samsung device this is as good as it gets for the price this Phone is being offered at.

Pros:

Super Amoled Display with Full HD resolution,
Humongous battery,
Decent Processor,
Above average camera, master the Pro mode for better shots,
Widevine L1 suport

Cons:

Plastic built, feels cheap in hand, especially the finger print sensor feels hollow while tapping,

Slow charging speeds, 15 watts is not very fast and much cheaper devices like note 7s and vivo u1 have 18 watt charging support, takes a good two and a half hour to charge

No notification LED, Always on display slightly makes up for it,

No ambient light sensor, uses front camera to adjust screen brightness which is slow.

No Gorilla glass, tempered glass would be necessary

All in all a great device for its price but with some compromises that aren't a deal breaker for most of the people.

A heating issue-The major issue with the phone is heating up after some time(while playing games or internet download).Some time it is very hot you cannot touch it to ear for a moment. Camera is not good enough. Build quality is average. Not a good looking phone. Performance is not good as we see with Snapdragon 660 or 710.

Only battery and Display are very good. Otherwise phone is not good enough. It may be better if Samsung fix heatning issue, Camera performance as early as possible.

1st day 1st impression is phone is ok. Too hyped by blogger and YouTube. People can say any thing for money. If you want to buy google following
“ I have peoblem in Samsung m30s” or “why Samsung m30s is lagging” you will get correct review.
I have used iPhone 6, Samsung and Microsoft lumia. Still carry all 3 phone in my family. 6s is working after battery change. Paid 1000 bucks and has better speed.

Lumia I would rate the best phone and biggest mistake of Microsoft to shut down - biggest blunder of mobile world. I still use lumia 540. Explorer is fastest among all 3 phone.

I have Samsung before so I bought new Samsung M30s to replace lumia as the whats app stoped thr support to windows phone. After 5 year of daily 5-7 hr use battery last for 1.5 day in 2020. No pop up ads no nonsense app.

Iphone has widened gap for 6 and x and 11 so much out of reach for now. But still I regret buying M30S which I could have shell out few more and boy iphone 7

Those who want to change phone every year - may be a good one

Date : 19/4/2020
The charging time is testing patience. It take over 5 hr to fully charge. I have restart phone and also tried change plug. But it takes too long to charge

Check the charging time 7 hrs+

This phone has been publicized with numerous gimmicks but the facts are entirely different. Speaker stopped working after 2 week.
1. CAMERA… pathetic watercolour effect in the captured images when zoomed. Colours are bit faded in wide angle mode. Noticeable lack of details aka sharpness in the images. Samsung must learn from Vivo MI cameras.

2. BUILT… flimsy back cover, check and feel the cover thickness between finger print sensor surface and back cover surface. For sure if it is dropped you are most likely to pay a visit in service centre and subsequent costly expenditures.

3. FINGERPRINT… sensor response is fairly slow as compared to the mid budget segment phones available in the market.

4. CALL RECORDER… is not in built (though options are shown in call settings). You have to depend on 3rd party app.

5. HEATING… it is still an issue. Exynos processors are generally considered as inferior to the Snapdragon processor and with the similar apps executed for same time Samsung phones heats up more.

6. BATTERY… is massive and so is draining. Use camera or GPS and check the result. It really drains fast.

7. ONLY INDIAN SIM… is permitted. Of course if you travel frequently abroad it is a major issue.

8. NO NATIVE SCREEN RECORDER… for on-screen videos. You will need 3rd party apps. Only screen shots are supported.

9. VOICE RECORDER… built in voice recorder is loaded with ad.

10. NO NETWORK SPEED INDICATION… in status bar.

So among the all above mentioned issues (Except point 2) everything can be resolved by subsequent firmware update provided Samsung wishes so.

Used it for three days and can say built quality is not good and not matching with the name "Samsung". Battery backup is also not good, need to charge it every day for normal usage without playing the games. Also for continuous 10mins talk, it getting heated as well, touch is also not working properly, loose back panel. I purchased this phone keeping the trust on Samsung and by seeing the advertisement of the tests done on this mobile by different people, but after using it for three days, I feel cheated. My 2 year old Mi Note 4 is still working better than M30s.

Been 2 weeks since I bought this phone. It meets all expectations. Despite what people say, the plastic back given by samsung is not bad at all. Glass back is premium but still, plastic back is not that bad. Display is superb. Out of three options for me (redmi note 8 pro, realme XT and s.g. M30s), I chose this phone and I'm not gonna regret it. Only problem is that there was no case given inbox by samsung. Cases available on online stores are not upto the mark. Other problem is that if you use your mobile with extra tempered glasses, it's very hard to find a proper fit. That's because there are many similar models like m30, A50, etc which have almost identical screen build. Most of the sellers will sell you tempered of these models. Screen will be covered by black border about 2mm from all sides. I tried twice but it was third time only that I found a perfect fit.
About performance which many reviewers on youtube mentioned, there is not much difference. I played pubg on it for a week and it runs smooth. It gives 'extreme' fps on 'smooth', 'ultra' on 'balanced' and 'high' on 'hd'. It supports hdr as well but phone will heat a bit in that case. HDR mode is better in realme xt and redmi note 8 pro but rest is almost same.
Review will be updated in case something happens.

Bought a Samsung Mobile after 10 years based on the M30 feedbacks from friends and reviews, I purchased this mobile as the camera and Battery spec's stand out from the crowd..... That's the mistake

Don't fall for marketing stunts, review thoroughly before you spend your hard earned money, I learned this by spending 13000Rs.

Frustrating things
1. A 5MP camera will do better than this mobile 48MP camera and front camera is not as expected for this price range and from this Brand
2. 6000mAH battery does stand for 1.5 days
3. Fast charger takes 4hrs to full charge the mobile
4. Finger print sensor works lethargically
5. Feeling of getting cheated by the specs where in other brands delivered to their promises

Feel good
1. Display
2. Touch screen feel
3. UI

Better mobiles are available.... Avoid this one, don't fall for the brand or by the predecessor

Super sharp and super bright screen (you can see clearly even in the brightest daylight and I have to bring the brightness to 10% when using the phone in a dark room) , really fast charging, amazing camera, fast fingerprint scan - so many thing to love in the phone. The phone has a 'Game mode' that is just lovely - phone speed increases, games start like super fast, notifications get suppressed - you can immerse yourself in the gaming experience!

In the price segment, this one is definitely a strong competition for Redmi! But the only thing that I was disappointed with is that the battery only lasts 1 day (with gaming for about 30 minutes in that day). For a 6000mah battery, I was hoping that it would work for two days. But the saving grace is that the battery charges really fast!

The looked amazing with best possible finishing initially. After around 3 days of use, every 3rd call has voice issue. The phone goes blank with no voice from either side. This is now happening very often. I bought two Samsung Galaxy M30 and the problem persists on both the phones, at different times, different locations and different network providers, thereby certainly an issue with the phone. Tried resetting the phone and other troubleshooting but no improvement. The major objective of the phone, i.e. call is not being met.

Purchased this on Amazon great indian sale on 28th Sept. 19, being a Prime Member &amp; received this on 29th September 19. After using it for 3 days i can say it is a Good Phone at this price point, it is good in it's daily day to day usage, it's camera is superb both front &amp; back, because of Super Amoled Display watching Videos on it is very satisfying compared to regular Full HD displays. The only Problem is for Gamers if anyone wants it for gaming than it is not for them, it's processor is too slow/outdated for gaming you have to Play PUB G at it's lowest settings otherwise you cannot play it, it has too much lag &amp; frame drop. Those who are not Gamers they can go for this phone without any doubt &amp; last but not the least it bit has a Massive 6000 mAh battery which lasts me for close to 2 days.

I have been using this from around last 3.5 months. Purchased it just after the launched in last week of Sep,2019.
Till now I found performance wise it is so impressive ! !
&gt;&gt; Battery life is very good with 6k mah. I don't do gaming so much, but  in daily use it gives almost 2 days backup. I use it for calls, Social media apps, Youtube, Netflix, HoiChoi etc.

&gt;&gt; Camera is very nice ! Ultra wide mode is very useful and gives perfect output with nice colorful and contrastful images. Can take very good quality selfie. You get a wide mode option in the selfie also.
Night mode is also good but not good as Oneplus.
I'm getting some issues while trying to use the cam in live focus mode ! But not every time.

&gt;&gt; Exynos 2.8 ghz processor works properly. I have played FIFA in this phone and Need For Speed also, and those were running properly. Although, I feel there is Little bit lag is there while starting those Games.

Overall I found this phone is very good one with this price range. For those who are planning to replace your handset, Just go for this one without any hesitation. But yes If you are a real gamer then think twice  before buy.

All the best .... :-D

Bought this mainly for the massive battery, as I was getting fed up with quick battery drain in my earlier phone. We Indians have become the the largest data consuming nation in the world and this helps. But, even a 6K mAH battery will see you through only a day of intensive use. The camera is decent but can't say that with the fingerprint reader, which is just ok. Overall performance of the phone is very satisfying. Amazon delivered it on time.

I purchased this mobile with lot of expectations which made me to give 3 star rating otherwise it's a minimum 4 star rating mobile. Still believing that these cons can be rectified through the software updates as I like Samsung very much. Cons...average rear camera quality,front camera is also not good, not great battery life for 6000mah battery but still better than remaining,lazy fingerprint sensor which is not working in power mode, default Samsung keyboard. Little bulky but still I love Samsung M30s. Waiting for the updations.Pros...value for money, low radiation levels, Super Amoled display etc.

I bought 6gb+128gb model on 25th jan. I was Researching on m30s from 3 months, from the time when it launched. (Note: Researching in the sense of from technical and scientific point of view) Previously i used many Xiomi mobiles, this is the first time i bought Samsung.
Pros:
1.Screen Quality - As it is Super Amoled screen, it is just perfect from all sides u see. Brightness is pretty high to see in Daylight.
Also display has very soft touch experience.

2.Performance - Performance is Good. No matter which processor is using. Exynos 9611 have capabilities same with Qualcomm  Snapdragon 675. Exynos 9611 carries good Performance as it is power efficient processor.
Dont worry abt Performance,  First Quad Core are based on A-73 Architecture,  which r very powerful cores, and another quad r based on A-53, which r normal one.
Almost all of Games can be played on medium settings. It really doesn't matter, that " one should play on Higher settings only".

3.Battery - 6K mah battery is just Insane. It lasts me abt Over 2 days, as its 6k mah still it not feel Heavy in hands. When i used Redmi 4 and Note 5 pro, they lasts abt 1 to 1.5 days.
Charging is Fast. It take 2 hrs to 2.5 hrs to charge. Time of charging is normal. Idk why people create issue on time of charging and on GPU of device.

4.Camera - Camera have Samsung GM1 sensor. Camera is Best i have ever seen. 48 mp is awesome,  also front camera also same , just awesome. Pictures have just Superior Crisp , clear quality.
We don't need 64 MP, it doesn't make such difference in 48 and 64, as we do not zoom soo much. Also 1 image of 64 mp camera comes to size of 30 MB.

5.Fingerprint Sensor and Face Unlock- Fingerprint sensor and Face Unlock are Fast, its speed is same as Note 5 pro and Redmi 4.

Cons: I didn't get any Cons from this device. Its just perfect from All Points.👍

I wanted to clear one point that, Many of you are thinking of whether should buy Redmi note 8 pro or Galaxy M30s.
Pls take note that if Performance , GPU and Looks are important,  then Screen Quality and battery also important.

And all these u get package of M30s...
Thanks guys.
Pls upvote..if u get some Unique Knowledge ✌

I bought this phone for 10.5k by exchanging my old Moto G4Plus and with 10% discount.
I really like its stunning style and performance. Battery is too good. With minimal usage I got almost 2 days.
On heavily usage (game, navigation) it lasts for 30 hours which is still better for 6000 mh battery
For full charging it took 3 hours.
The one concern is that it seems very slippery from hand so need to put a case.
Camera is awesome. Super slow motion is there.
We can put two sim and one memory slot there.
Another concern is that it has by default unnecessary Samsung softwares are there and opera browser and all.
Backside finger sensor is very convenient.

Lets start with good things -
1) display - excellent display with beautiful
 bright amoled display. One of the best display in budget prise segment.

2) battery -  monster 6000 mah battery with almost 2 day battery backup for normal use.

3) no heating - no heating issues found.

4) camera-  camera is good not excellent. But good at this prise.

5) no lag- feel no lagging till now.

Bad things-
1) built quality - built quality is not top notch. Its plastic back. But its not problem its personal choice.

2) thickness - this phone is slightly thiker than normal phone. But it is because of big battery size. Again its not a big problem.

Overall best phone for budget prise segment with beautiful display &amp; good battery backup.

Till now I see no issues in using the product. Below are my 12 days observations
Pros
1. Battery – For me it lasts for 2 days in normal usage. So 6000mAh is really working
2. Display – Samsung really killed it. I’m happy with Super AMOLED display
3. Performance – I’m a normal user. Based on my need I had not seen any delay/lag in performance. Even if the apps remain in RAM for couple of days, there is no lag
4. Signal Receiver – No issues so far. I checked Jio + Idea
5. Mic – No issues so far.
6. Speaker – The sound is bit low. Can be improved. But it’s not that bad
7. Camera – I like the wide angle feature
Cons
1. Camera – Basically I purchased this for camera. This should be improved. Sometimes I really doubt is it 48MP. The bokeh/Live Focus mode sometimes doesn’t work as expected.
2. Finger print sensor – Sometimes this doesn’t detect soon. You either need to wash your hands (or) enter pin to access. The sensing is fast.
3. Mobile heating – I got to see mobile heating a bit when testing camera quality for taking different photos with variations
4. Battery draining – No draining in case of normal usage. I noticed some drain on excessive camera usage
5. Build quality – The back panel is plastic and it’s not that good. The body/built quality should be improved. Case should be used

It is worst experience &amp; headache buying this fake product from samsung. Post 11 day of use screen got unresponsive &amp; need to visit service center to replacement. Samsung has no faith in there product quality hence there is no return policy for this product.

Phone started hanging from 3rd day. Even you click any photos. It takes ages to save &amp; phone get hang.
Camera quality is worst not even 8 mega pixel &amp; neither it battery last for 24 hours. Don't at all waste money &amp; buy headache &amp; land into frustration for getting repaired.

I will briefly rate the aspects of the phone so it becomes easy for you to decide whether you should get it or not.

Screen: 9/10
Battery: 10/10
Camera: 4/10
Speed: 9/10
Lag: None so far

Impressed? Yes.

I personally don’t use Android but my parents are good with Android so got one M30 and M30s, both phones have exceeded my expectations for sure in terms of everything but the CAMERA. Even Nokia (Legend) mobiles with 2-5 MP camera had better quality while this Triple Camera is nothing but a bluff.

So if you want to buy it for the Camera, DON’T. I didn’t buy it for the CAMERA so not disappointed but yeah some of you tik tokers might lose followers 😂

Pleasr click the Helpful button and read my other reviews, maybe you’ll find something interesting worth buying ;)

I was using Samsung A50 with 4GB and 6GB configuration. I selected this phone for 6GB RAM and 128GB memory. I regret buying this phone as many features are questionable...some of them are as below
Adaptive brightness sensor is not up to mark and works very slow
Though as per specification M30s has SAMOLED display but I doubt it as its quality is not at all satisfactory. I can notice clear difference between screen of A50 and M30S. A50 has far better screen than M30S.
In M30S while using auto brightness, it keeps brightness relatively very low compared to other phones. It's better for battery usage but not at all good for using camera, seeing photos in Gallery as every time brightness has to be increased manually.
Speaker is totally Ghatiya quality. Listening music and listening calls on loud speakers both gives bizarre experience. A50 has far far better speakers.
Camera is just ok. It's of no use in low light.
Overall M30S is made to compete with other low cost brands but if you want quality then ignore this model.

Please note that I am putting my pathatic review after using the phone for last 6 days. I don't know how gadget guru's make people fool with fake biased review.
1. Once purchase there is no refund if you don't like the product
2. The camera is pathetic. A bellow 10k phone is far better than 48mp triple camera pictures. In low lights not a single picture you will like to keep after taking snaps.
3. The speaker sound is not even clearly audio able in home itself, very low sound . You have to make pindrop sound silence to hear the sound. The micro phone does not picks up sound with a little distance.
Please don't become a pray of marketing skills of Amazon for selling samsung mobiles.

Worst camera.
Leave about 48MP, after looking at the pics(in mobile, not PC/laptop) you will feel like pictures were taken from some kind of 2MP or age-old 8MP camera. The battery is good but not up to the mark, for 6000mah you would expect it to last for minimum 2 days at least with basic usage(no movies/games/heavy browsing etc..) like calls and checking notifications, messaging, etc. It lasted for just 28 hours for me with basic usage. Charging time was around 3hrs.

Wifi coverage is also limited. It doesn't connect if I am in different room which was not the case with real me and One Plus phone.

The only best thing is the display. I think this mobile has got the best display under 15K range. If your only priority is display then nothing can beat this mobile under 15K.

And the worst part is that there is no replacement for this mobile, only refund. I believe replacement was not given considering the additional 1000 cashback which will be credited to the seller if they refund the amount, not sure though. Seller - STPL Exclusive Online.

The fingerprint and face recognition is slow but that doesn't bother anyone. The battery backup is very very good
For an instance you can play pubg mobile at smooth with extreme (60 fps) continuously for around 6 to 7 hours with full battery.
Camera is awsome love the slow motion mode best camera for this price
Also what makes it best smartphone is the AMOLED display the colurs are fabulous. At dark images the screen shut off where dark pixels are present
At last i would give 9.5/10
The .5 was deducted beacuse of slow biometrics .

I used my phone for a month now.  I have seen some pros and cons with this phone.

Pros:
1. Nice phone with good battery life. You can improve battery life to 2 days by optimize apps, configure notifications to show for apps which are necessary.
2. Being with Samsung S family for last 7+ years,  i felt comfortable using in my day to day life.
3. Triple camera is new (earlier used S series) and happy upgrade for me.
4. Remember that you might lose some pic quality with far away lens.
5. Finder print reader is good but slow.

Cons:
1. Night photos even with light is not awesome. I go back to my S9 which is easy and with less blur for pics.
2. Using this phone for active kids might be a little challenge with low light or when they run away far.
3. Finger print scanner is slow.
4. Phone freezes up sometimes (not more than 10 to 15 secs).

Final note:
I didn't do PUBG or other graphics rich apps or games. Low light or night pic photos noise or blurriness might be experienced on similar budget models in 10k range. I wish all brands increase optical zoom instead of MP.  As always with Samsung phones i want a strong speaker on this one too. They should start going for dual speakers with extra bass.

There is a problem with the M30s device.  Camera is of bad quality, it adds artificial colors to skin making it yellowish dull images.  Few minutes of camera usage and battery heats up.  16mp Selfi camera  does not contain zoom in and out feature and most important 48mp camera clicks looks like ordinary, no details.  Eye start paining after few hours of usage.  Even screen of this device is having some defect, pale yellowish even when set to vivid and cool in configuration. One can see the difference in image.

Wish to return this phone or sell it off to some one with 1000/- less then amazon.  I am not satisfied.

Phone has got hacked by Samsung. they have all the access. I ordered the phone for my friend from my account and i only received the order. But when my frnd inserted his SIM he started getting calls from Samsung team asking for feedback. I would strongly recommend not to buy phones from this company. Already we are Living in a world where people are stealing others personal information easily. Now we cant even trust the production company. Im afraid to use this phone now. How will I use my bank account or keep my personal information in this phone.

For the final amounti paid for this product after discounts on cards, cash back etc. this phone is worth.

Pros:
Display
Sensors
Technology
Battery
Memory
Storage

Cons:
Build quality

Body is of plastic unlike earlier phones, my last phone j7 prime was of metal body.
Though the camera battery are not up to the stated configuration phone is really good for this price range.

Technology like Dolby atmos sound, sensory, adaptive brightness. These are some cool stuff.

Super amoled display with 23** x 1980 pixels its too good.

Conclusion: go for it

I bought 6GB 128gb for 14690 k after all discounts and cashback on a great Indian festival sale

In case of features, its not a monster even though they claim to be. There is NO KNOX PROTECTION or SECURE FOLDER in this series. Sound quality is below average. In case of camera, picture quality is average only.
Pros... Good battery life, you can manage 2 days with a single charging on moderate usage. Display is  upto the mark, but easily  breakable as not gorilla glass .

I hv bought M30s as gift to my Wife - replacing J5 prime. We are Samsung family, I still use Note 8. A50 was my first choice, but once I saw specs of M30s, no second thoughts. After using for a month, following is our feedback
Pros:
# Fabulastic display - so real. Typical Samsung AMOLED. No surprise!
# Exynos processor is good. No legs observed so far in our day to day casual use.
# Touch response is super awesome. (Better than my Note 8)
# Battery life is very good. Fast charging is ok at this price.
# Good ergonomics- didnt expect this phone would be so light considering 6000mAH battery
# Finger print sensor is does its job (not super fast as One Plus, but u won't feel delay)

Cons:

# Camera : we are just casual shooters. Camera for this price is good. But still finish is bit unnatural.Dont expect Flagship quality though. My Note 8 is still faaaaaar better (Both Front and rear)
# Plastic body - samsung does it's best at this price range. Metal frame would have been nice and give solid feel.

What I expect more?
# Water proof - atleast splash proof?
# OIS for rear camera - OIS would do wonders for this camera I beleive
# Gorilla glass is order of the day. No need of latest version. Probably 3rd generation Gorilla glass also OK.

If samsung can accomadate these changes even with 2~3K more, M30s would be a blockbuster. But for given price point, I absolutely have no complaints. By far this is best budget phone in the market now.

I've been using M30s since last week.  After using it I am of the view that in Rs. 16,000/-(1,000/- cashback) range, this is the best that anyone can have.  Battery is really a monster one. Good camera quality.  Previously I was using one plus 3t.  There r few features lacking in this phone like themes option isn't good enough, double tap wake up isn't here, it has plastic body, etc.  But when it comes to battery backup, this is the monster.  It has a fast fingerprint option but you've swipe its screen everytime even after face unlocking.
Speaker volume is good with extra loud levels.
Rest I'll update here after using this device.

This phone is just okay!
I changed over from Samsung Galaxy J7-2016, mainly because of two reasons: 1) J7  did not have any ambient light sensor and 2) Samsung stopped providing all updates including security updates.
M30S uses front camera as light sensor; it is slow and consumes substantial battery. Whenever I look at the battery usage, the front camera light sensor is always on top! The result is this phone runs for same 2 days as my old J7 inspite of having a battery with double capacity rating.
J7 had a metallic body which remained as good as new after 3 years of usage and M30S has a plastic body which makes clicking sound if you hold it a little tight!
4 GB RAM is a necessary improvement since the UI along with very minimal running app consumes about 1.9 GB.
The phone works generally okay.

False Promises, A simple piece of stone age phone utter piece of junk...
CAMERA quality is big draw back.48 MP camera promised is not even match for 8MP camera. In 14k One shall get Redmi Note 7pro, RealMe X,Xt with better camera quality than this. Camera quality is very bad. Blur in all photos. When zooming any pic, it cracks. If compared to redmi 7 pro camera, redmi is much better.
Battery is another masterpiece, just sheds from 100% to 70% in 5 hours of idle time.
Called amazon for replacement, as per their policy they cannot even take this junk for return.

My 14k is total vain, Planning to seek consumer court for this low quality, under rated phone.

Total disappointment….!!!!!

The worst thing is that Amazon is trying to fool people with the mobile phones. I bought the mobile phone because of its 48mp camera and as I was suppose to travel abroad. But then the mobile box says "INDIAN SIM CARD ONLY" and now it's of no use to me if I'm travelling abroad. They are cheating customers without mentioning it on description about the phone that will not work outside India. When I spoke to customer support they are of no use, they just imagine that we Indians don't travel abroad and phones are only for Indian use. It's really worst experience, Amazon just can't assume about India and indians.

Takes a very long time to get charged and has a shorter battery life than you expect from a  6000mAh battery.
The phone is very heavy plus has a built in body problem due to which it gets pressed on applying mild pressure.
I wanted to return it but could not do it due to amazon's no refund policy.
There are better phones in this  price range available in the market.

Hey there! I'm not really a technical person, but I am more of an end-user. I was a Moto user, starting from the first Moto E launched on Amazon. I bought this Samsung M30s for the fantastic value it offers in terms of the 6 GB/128 GB configuration, the camera, and the screen. I'm happy with the decision to buy this phone, based on my usage for the last 2 weeks.
(1) It's not too big to hold either, for one-handed operation, considering the 6000 mAh battery. The battery life is decent enough to last for a day and a half of regular usage.
(2) Since this phone has a C-type charging port, I also invested in a short C-type charging cable for use with a battery bank (the regular micro-USB cable will not work as input to this phone).
TIP: If you use battery banks, consider getting one that has a C-type input, so that you don't have to carry two types of cables with you.
(3) In case you love to take photographs, you'll also find pictures from both the cameras (front and back) pretty decent. I have attached three photographs, all taken at night/indoors. You can see the excellent rendering of the photos with sharp edges and high clarity, even at night or indoors. With bright lights or outdoors, the photos are really good.
(4) Let me also mention about the display screen, which is one of Samsung mobiles' biggest qualities. I have seen Prime movies on the screen and have to say that every small detail is clear on the screen. HD movies appear truly High Definition!
(5) Another aspect worth mentioning is the Dolby sound effect that one gets with headphones (both wired and Bluetooth) on. The sound output is crisp and clear, and true Dolby sound.
CONS:
I have not found any specific area of improvement given that this is a reasonable-budget phone. One can, of course, argue for various technical improvements. However, if I compare this phone with my Moto Phones earlier (incuding Moto E Plus and Moto G5 Plus), this is at the top.

Ok, so i also fell for the brand , in actual its not thay great. Fingerprint reader is bad, there is so much lag time. Camera is decent, battery is over hyped, i am not a heavy user nor do i play too many games...so ideally with that usage based on my previous cell phones from Huawei the battery should last atleast 3 days....however here battery will last max till 1.5 days which is not that good.

UI is not that great either, there is no built in app lock, no built button to capture screenshot(even basic mobiles are giving these features).

Its not a bad cell phone but given the brand, its very visible that Samsung wanted to focus on price rather than quality.

Likes:
Battery life (almost 2 days).
Good quality amoled panel - neat &amp; clean display.
Smooth touch even under screen protection glass.
Apps and games are fairly quick to load and run without any glitch.
Speaker is loud and clear and call quality is also good.
Sound quality through headphone is mellifluous.
Camera really good in day light. And having lot of options of photo editing too.
Both user interface and its experience is very gentle.

Dislikes:
Its weight - little heavy.
Night shot of camera - could be better.
Fast charging - it's not faster as we used to imagine about fast charging, may be for the 6000 mAh battery it's normally fast charging, I've not enough idea. In my case it takes at least 1hr 30 m to be full charged (from 18% to 100%).
Experiencing lagging at the time of opening Call log and Contact list.

Display is great,
Camera is good, not great though as pics in low light are a bit let down considering the camera specs.
The battery will last 1.5 days with moderate use, was expecting it to last at least 2 full days of usage @ 6000mAh, actual battery rating is @5800mAh shows in system information.
Wonder how long the battery will last for gamers 🙄.
Speakers are good 👍.
No issues in connectivity of all sorts.
No heating issues at all.
Got 1 year screen protection.
Actual RAM available  is @ 2gb, as 2gb is always reserved  for system, I feel this is a bit unfair.
Needs tons of update on startup.
The phone surely grabs attention 👏

The Body has some hollow gaps, specifically in the  edge which makes button press sound when pressed. This makes the phone vulnerable to crack up when it falls .

Secondly the hand-held speaker's sound is feable . You cant talk to people at crowded places at all.

The claim about the battery life is all farse. Its hardly left after 14-15 hrs.

At times when you are on a call and post call you switch to a music player, the sound ends up playing from the hand-held speaker rather tha. The normal one.

The selfiecamera is pathetic, no details, its more like the filter effect always even if you switch it off.

First of all I would like to say Samsung is compromising with its M series. Camera is average, Battery is very poor. My previous phone had 4230mah which easily lasted for one and half days after more than average uses whereas M30s has 6k battery but still it is not giving full 1 day battery backup. The only thing which is the best is display. I really opted for this mobile only because of display and battery but I was really disappointed after such battery back up, it is not as expected at all. Well I already returned the device successfully.

All the things excluding battery life are wonderful considering the sensitive price point. Build quality is not top notch and feels a bit plasticky sort of. Display is awesome but with a slight yellowish tinge. Corning gorilla glass is absent hence using a tempered glass and back cover are must. Manufacturer has compromised with light sensor and the set uses the front camera as a light sensor which takes a toll on the battery. Cameras are reasonably good. Knox feature and NFC are absent here. Quite awkwardly the battery didn't perform like the publicised monstrous way at the beginning but after a hard reset a stretch of 2 days can be had with mild to moderate usage. Although it comes with a fast charger, it takes 2 hrs plus time to charge the battery. Fingerprint reader is very quick as well as the face unlocking facility. I guess a software update will sort out the battery issue in near future. Voice over Wi-Fi facility is available right now. Altogether it's a very good budget set with required features if one doesn't shoot up their expectation level sky high.

A monster in budget range. Got the 6, 128 version at 14k from Amazon. Takes 2hr15mins to get fully charged &amp; almost 50hrs to discharge. People are saying camera isn't up to the mark. I'll share some samples, decide for yourself. The best part of the phone isn't the battery or the camera. It's the experience. The experience of one UI, a premium software on a super amoled full HD + screen. I never have used Samsung before. I was a Xiaomi guy. Was unsure about Samsung. Now I realise how shit miui really is. Nothing really to complain about this phone. Really, it's worth buying. Its worth every penny, and more.
Pros :
1. Battery
2. Screen
3. Camera
** best part - the wide angle lens. It's a cherry on the cake
4. Software and UX
5. Performance
6. Agility
P.S - snapdragon chipsets may perform better at gaming,  but for people like me, who hardly plays any game, exynos too gives a satisfying experience. The best part is the multi processing power and ram management.

Absolute MONSTER! A massive 6000 Mah battery that goes on and on... I have been using it for more than a month now and never had the battery die down on me, inspite of heavy usage (read videos, high quality gaming, browsing, social media etc.). Combine the battery with super fast 128 GB Storage &amp; 6 GB Ram powered by the new EXYNOS 9611 superior processor and you have the true monster unleashed.
The M30s has a 6.4" Amoled screen which needs no introduction - best in class. The graphics are top line but sound could have been better - has Dolby Atmos capability for headphones only &amp; comes with a single speaker.
A Gorilla glass screen would also have been welcome along with a factory installed screen guard &amp; protective case.
All in all, it's a phone that lives up to the hype &amp; Samsung's reputation and is a winner on all counts in this price segment.

It's an Amazing Smartphone and trust me, it's a very light smartphone considering it's 6000mAh battery. Performance is butter smooth and no lag felt at all. The cameras are quite good for the price. I bought the 6GB+128GB variant for my mom at Rs.12300 by exchanging it with her 4 year old Galaxy J7(2015). I feel that it's a killer deal. The UI is incredible and Super Amoled Display is something you can never find in any non Samsung device. I'm not praising because I bought it. I've experienced UI in many smartphones in this price range and clearly this is the best (even better than Stock Android). Overall I'm very much satisfied for this Monster deal.
Coming to Amazon service, they took 5 days to deliver it to me in Hyderabad whereas many here in the reviews report to have received their device in under 2 days... So 3⭐ for their service.

For someone whose primary screen is a mobile, I couldn't have gotten a better display quality at this price point or little higher. Playing PUBG is a treat on this mobile. 6000mAh battery lets me watch a lot of episodes of my fav TV shows in one go even when I'm outside. I donated my power bank to a friend after I bought this phone 😜. 48MP sensor is stunning and I love using the wide-angle camera. Sound quality is surprisingly very good. One UI, even though not so perfect, is as clean as it can get. This is the second M series phone in the family now after I bought my mom an M20 on the day it released.

Cons first:
1.Delivery was bad, box got somewhat damaged but that hasn't affected the phone.
2.Camera isn't satisfying I mean it isn't like 48MP My old OnePlus with 13MP is better I would say.
3.headphone jack could have been at the top conventionally.
4.no indisplay fingerprint
5.no case cover or screen protector and headphone in the box, as the product is new to launch finding the case n guard in market is very difficult. Hasen't found any still, so not using mobile fully yet, as I fear of scratches.
6.Facerecognition isn't working!

Pros:-1.Display is great sAMOLED is just awesome, screen ratio is 91% to body. Aways ondisiplay clock is very attractive.
2.dark mode is available which is my favourite.
3.Battery is monster!! 6kmAh battery so great I used it for 2hrs to install n update few but the charge decreased by only 7%.
4.Look- is just cool if not that great.
5.performance- So fast n responsive. Android one UI is so classy as always and couldn't think of anything better.

Takeaway- I am disappointed because there was some damage to the box and camera isn't satisfying to me, and Samsung won't provide case n guard. But I will post the detailed review once I get case n guard on after using it for few days.

Everything about tgis phone is good.
pros:-
1.Really good back camera.As for the front camera it could have been a little better.But I will give five starts for the back camera.The camera has slow motion,super slow motion and hyperalapse feature which are the three new cool features you can find in a phone.

2.The battery is a 6000mAh battery with fast charging.It lasts upto 48 hours.

3.It is a light weighted phone with sleek design.

For cons I haven't found any yet.I am not a phone expert so my review is based on what I desired and expected from this phone.It has fufilled both.If you find this helpful leave a like.😊✌

The display clarity abs camera are too good but the sound clarity and effect is very poor. More over, the main complaint and why I gave 3 star is,  the phone is not supportive of headset. I have tried brands lined Samsung,  Philips,  Sony,
and MI too. The same headsets which didn't work with this phone are working with other phones perfectly. That's how I understood this phone is not headset supportive.  Since its new model thinking of calling customer care to find a solution. I hate picking up calls without headset. Also,  this phone is heated up when you speak,  which I am afraid of using near ear.

This is an honest review after using the phone for a month.

Pros:
Good battery life for normal usage. (battery drains faster with heavy gaming)
Excellent super amoled display (though no in-screen fingerprint)
Good quality daylight shots in pro mode but average in auto.
Fasting charging (though phone gets little hot but no worries)
Triple card slot (you can use 2 sim cards and 1 micro sd card)
Bluetooth v5 but there is lots of distortion during calls and online video viewing.
3.5mm headphone jack.
Video recording in UHD 4K (3840 x 2160) @ 30fps and Slow Motion in 240fps @HD
LPDDR4x RAM

Cons:
Quite heavy due to large battery capacity.
Average camera quality in auto mode.
Front facing camera not at all good in night shots.
No headphones, cover or screen guard included in the box.
Processor is not that optimized due to which battery drains faster than expected (still can be used for 1.5 days in normal usage)
Lots of lags when phone gets heat up or during pop-up app view.
NO CORNING GORILLA GLASS protection.

Overall its a good phone for normal usage but below average if you are a heavy user or a gamer.

You can expect to get too much at this price, and if u are attracted to other brand who are offering more in same price the mind it, they are cheating on things which Samsung doesn't do. For example, All other brand like Vivo, Oppo, Lenovo, Motorola do not com with precisioned sensors like Samsung does. So u might feel other brands offering better features in same price where as Samsung is not, so u r mistaken by just the lucrative ads and marketing, there is no way u can compare Samsung's precision level with any other brands. I didnt name Redmi or Xiaomi, as ther are no where in race when it comes to quality, the worst thing about Xiaomi is that they have integraed uncontrolled ads in their MIUI, which is dangerous, as kids come across adult advertisement sin MIUI interface which you will never be able to block, so think before u buy MI or Redmi, as they might charge u less but earning huge by serving you and your kids with those uncontrolled adult ads in heir MIUI..

Samsung's M40 was its biggest mistake , but believe me M30s is charm to use, though it lack certain proprietary and premium Samsung features like Knox, and Samsung pay but still its worth the price, and obvious to buy premium features you should go for more premium series like Samsung A series or S series etc

With all the offers from Amazon, this is one hell of a bargain. The performance is snappy given the price point, 9611 helps a lot. The screen is good, 8 of 10, not mindblowing like my S8+, but definitely better than anything in this price bracket. RAM and int. memory is sufficient. The camera is good. For those complaining bad picture quality, please change it to full 48 m.p and check the same. Its not a pixel but definitely not a slouch in quality, 7 of 10. Last but not the least battery, lets not say anything, it's still running after the first full charge, 2 days of medium to heavy usage, 8% left in the tank!!!, 10+ of 10.
With exchange I paid a little less than 10k, simply loved it! A winner from Samsung. Also Amazon, thank you.

Bought it when launched. Good phone for the price you pay.
Amoled screen is impressive. Battery backup is good. Lag-free performance(4GB). No heating problem. Videos are great while still photos are not so. Sound quality and volume are just okayish while there's notable improvement over earphones(must be the inbuilt Dolby feature). Build quality is not great. Protective case and screen guard are a must. The finger print sensor seems unwilling most times and utterly unyielding sometimes. Did not try face recognition for the fear of disappointment.
Overall, M30S is a good phone and why not, it's a Samsung no..

*Perfectly Crafted for New India.
*Killer specs in Mid &amp; Premium Segment.
*48MP Main and Wide angle cameras are High-end.
*Battery backup of 2days at min. (I'm getting 2.5 to 3days)
*Samsung AMOLED Display - same as Galaxy S9 series panels.
*Processor, Graphics, and LPDDR4X are same as Galaxy A50s and upcoming Galaxy A51.
*Call of Duty and PUBG runnings in 'HD' Graphics.

Built-quality is Average and good considering price. Just add a good tempered glass and military grade case for perfect protection.

Attaching some camera samples.
Regards,
AVD

Value for money.

PROS;
✓✓ Display is Super AMOLED, outdoor display brightness is better than M30,
✓✓ Ultra-wide camera is improved and captures 123 degree
✓✓ Battery is bigger enough to be compared with a battery of MacBook Pro,
✓✓ Phone is lightweight as 188gm while holding a bigger battery with capacity of 6000mAh,
✓✓ Triple camera setup includes a 48mp Samsung GM1 sensor, an 8mp ultra wide angle lens and a 5mp depth. Front camera is also 16mp,
✓✓ It does not have EIS but Super Steady mode is impressive. It can record 4K videos, Super Slow-Mo and Hyper lapse,
✓✓ Type-C port along with a 3.5mm headphone jack provided,
✓✓ Exynos 9611 octa-core chipset based on a 10nm process. Same processor has been used on Samsung A50S which is being sold at higher price by same brand. Performance is smooth and competent for playing games because Exynos 9611 is better than the Snapdragon 665 as per my experience,

CONS;
✓✓ Body is made of plastic which makes it quality inferior and does not give it a premium look like other Samsung phones,
✓✓ Front screen and Back glass are not protected like Corning Gorrila Glass so beware of losing it. (If you have enrolled for Amazon 1 year screen replacement program then fine otherwise AMOLED display replacement can cost you minimum Rs.6k)
✓✓ Processor is power consuming and Battery performance is not upto expectation, even its same almost like M30 as I compared with my brothers phone,
✓✓ 15W fast charging is slow for this giant battery,
✓✓ Small size apertures (48mp cam with an f/2.0 aperture, 5mp with an f/2.2 and 8mp with f/2.2.) capture less light through it. Result average night mode and less blurred bokeh,
✓✓ Front cam selfie lack detailing and seems smoother and Super steady mode does not work on it,
✓✓ No inscreen fingerprint sensor like Mi A3 which is earlier launched in lower range,
✓✓ NFC is no future technology and missing it in a latest phone does make it lack at some point
✓✓ Face unlock is not faster and effective
✓✓ Slo-mo video Flickers in artificial lightening

A value for money phone from samsung at this price range..

I am writing practicle user experience after 15 days of use. You can get full technical specifications on the description page of this product on Amazon or on Samsung official website.

Pros:

Battery back up (6000mAh) is great, lasting for 2 days with mobile data on, few youtube videos, usual calls and WhatsApp and Facebook.

Loudspeaker  is also good at this price range.. Calls received on speaker phone are well heard except for some calls where there is some network issue or the other party is speaking in low voice. You need to ask the other person to speak louder.

Usual usage doesn't see any lags in operation, so the Exynos Octacore processor works very well.

Opal black colour looks awesome with greenish shade..

Fingerprint sensor works good but is slower than my old moto g4 plus, which was not expected. With wet fingers, sensor doesn't work.

Call quality is good and the voice is heard crystal clear..

Even after having a massive battery, the weight management of the device is very good.. doesn't feel heavy..

RAM management is awesome and can load and remember any app used in past 24 hours swiftly..

Cons:

Autobrightness sensor is of average quality as it uses front camera sensor for adjustment and the speed of adjustment is also slow. There is no seperate sensor.

Compass app doesn't work properly..

Camera quality is very good at this price range, but in indoor or low light, the quality gets disturbed.. However, it doesn't show results of 48MP as expected. Selfies lack details most of the times.

Video recording from back camera yeilds very good results. 4K video recording, with ultra wide angle and Super Slow motion recording are awesome. Super Slow Mo only works in Full HD and not in 4K. Front camera recording lacks image stabilizer.

Overall, It is a very good phone to buy at this range. Please do upvote if you found this review useful.

One of the great value for money product from samsung. Change display setting nature to vivid for more picture clarity. Battery backup amazing its have 6000mah battery. Why wasting money for cheap Chinese brands, buy samsung! My mother was happy with Samsung's userfriendly interface and bold fonts and night mode. Thats why I am always choose samsung for her

As advertised but absolutely nothing beyond. Camera and battery are great. 6gb ram is also good. Screen is good. Phone is definitely bulky. Front cam is ok compared to rear. No lags. Audio is fine especially with earphones.  Off screen gesture controls are not there( like in one plus). Non hybrid SIM and SD card slot is added advantage with respect to storage. The signal strength is good. No complaints there. Wifi works with 5ghz as well. 4g/lte data connection also works fine. You may have difficulties if you are outside India as the lte there may not work. 2g still works fine even outside India.

Display is little yellowish and can't change the tone of display on natural colour mode.
Dolby atmos is there but there is negligible difference between Dolby atmos on and off.
Custom equalizer is worst and useless.
Battery doesn't feel like 6000mAh may be cause of amoled display n exynos processor.
Network reception is not good as other phones.
Build quality is really cheap.
No knox security
No edge lighting
No good lock

So the unique features from Samsung r missing. U can skip the M series if u r looking for Samsung's features.

I got this in Rs.11600 including all the offers so in this price it is probably the best phone.

These is my honest review, product packaging is very third class not even bubblerapped the mobile box, camera quality is very bad, it has only name 48mp but in actual it is 12mp camera also if I take a slow motion video it goes all dark same problem with wide angle photos it goes dark in brighter light environments, viewing angles are very bad looks like Not a Amoled but a TFT display...Network reception is very poor as compare to other mobile I have vivo mobile at same time same spot vivo show full network and Samsunh m30s shows only to bars...very bad experience from amazon and samsung...I want to apply for my refund but there is no such option for these..Amazon customer services are very bad...I am switching to flipkart now...

After watching a lot of reviews, I decided to go with the m30s as a birthday gift for my mom and I must say, this has been one of the best phones I have seen in under 15k. I didn't want to go for another generic Chinese phone filled with bloatware cause with the ongoing ad controversy, it would be an unnecessary hassle for her. Setting up the phone was a breeze and so is Samsung's One UI to use. An Amazing Amoled display combined with use of blacks in the UI has been giving really great battery so far and I'm sure will continue to do so with the Monstrous 6000Mah Battery. Even with such a large battery, the device doesn't feel very heavy thanks to the evenly distributed weight of the handset. The build quality could have been better tho is what i feel. The Plastic body is prone to scratches. The back also houses the 48mp Camera which has lived up to its name. The shots have great colors, clarity and detail, Samsung's camera app is easy to use and learn and has excellent software optimization too. Performance has been great, apps load up quickly and ram management has been decent too, apps stay in memory for quite a long time.Although the SOC Exynos 9611 is not meant for gaming, I tried games like PUBG and Asphalt and they ran without any issues and overheating.  Overall the device has been a great experience and you also get quality assurance as its from Samsung which isn't very common with brands these days.

i got this product delivered in one day really awesome product go for it i compared it with realme pro5 which is similar bu this one is great becoz of its feature.
its looks are ok but the working is awesome and its sound is a little less comparing to other phone but its great form watching movies all along
what i disliked is the exchange offer many in my neighbours were ready to buy my old phone for 2000 but the person who gave exchange is for only 1500and twist is here when he came told that my screen has been replaced and not glued properly despite it is in fll perfect condition i was really scared and after a while he told its ok just give me 500 ill give the package or it will get rejected i as very angry but in the end i gave him 500rs just becoz this scheme and offer as only till 4th and i didnt want to lose this opportunity so i had to sacrifice more 500 rs so please dont go for exchange if ur device has even 1 single scratch it might get rejected

An awesome phone for the price paid. Got it delivered within few hours of placing the order. The M30s has a pretty interesting triple camera set up on the back and the selfie shooter too is decent but the main focus has always been on the 6000 mAh battery which hopefully will last 2 days. The super AMOLED screen is GORGEOUS.

Purchased the product entirely believing Samsung's tall claims about its 'monster' 6000mAH battery... It is just a sales gimmick.  There is nothing 'monstrous' about the battery.  Once fully charged, the battery does not last more than 26 or 27 hours, at the most. The company's claims are all wrong.  Besides, the charging time is painfully slow, again contrary to Samsung's claims.  It takes nearly three hours for the battery to reach 100 per cent from 20 per cent.  My earlier phone, Samsung On Nxt, too had the same issues.  That is why I discarded it.  It seems Samsung has some serious problems with its battery.  Lesser priced Chinese models perform much better.  So, to put it in a nutshell, I regret purchasing the phone.

Well since I've been using the S9+ for a while and my experience with the M10 was decent. I thought I'll take a chance with the M30s considering I needed a back up phone with a reasonable battery life. To my surprise, the M30s is by far a brilliant phone. The screen quality, the sound, the wide angle camera and then to top it up the outstanding battery back up. With an extremely basic usage, I've not charged the phone for 4 days with 20% still on it. 30mins if PUBG can drain up to a max of 3 - 5% battery which is brilliant !! Loving it.

There phone is really good. It's battery life, display,screen touch, performance are awesome. Fingerprint reader takes time to unlock, may be because I use back cover.
Camera quality is very bad. Earlier I had used Moto g5s plus, it gave me excellent quality photos and videos. Someone suggested me to get my camera replaced at Samsung service center. Such is the quality of photos I had clicked for an event using M30s.

Only dissatisfaction is camera quality, all other features are really good.

My two bits on M30s
1. 48 mp camera acts like a 16mp camera.
2. 6000 mAh battery is a myth and it's good for one day only.
My previous phone was an Honor Play with 3750 mAh battery and I bought this M30s for a 48mp cam and 6000mAh battery however, I am highly disappointed with its performance. Nothing special in this phone as displayed in its specs on paper. Now I can understand why Samsung mobile prices keeps on decreasing day by day and you can find Opportunity, Vivo and Samsungs on OLX which are less than 6 months old.
Honor, Nokia, LG, Asus and Lenovo phones are far better than these below 20000 INR crap phones by Samsung. Either go for S10 or Galaxy Note series else better to stay away from Samsung.

Being an WP10 user it was really tough &amp; disheartening for me to switch to an android as Microsoft decided to end support for Lumia phones( I owned Lumia 950) I was always fascinated by the camera performance &amp; screen quality of Lumia 950.
When I saw features of M30s, I decided to go for it as it had the features I required.
1. Battery life : Amazing. Usually it works for almost 2.5 days for me
2. Camera quality : 48 MP with smart shot is amazing. Picture quality is very good. Slow mo &amp; super slow mo works fine
3. Screen : Good quality Amoled, vibrant colours
4. 6 gb Ram : Works really smooth
5. 128 GB memory : More than enough

Overall, a good phone to go for. Plus the same is supported by Samsung so there shouldn't be any issues with post purchase support.

I liked quality of photos from camers, full Mark's for that. Charging is really fast as expected. But battery consumption is fast considering 6000mA battery.  I need to charge it daily.  In my previous mobile of MI which wasn of 4000mA, but I used to charge alternate day.
One thing Samsung should improve that if you want to search and call a number from contacts,  it takes about 5 clicks and after pressing dial button, it takes 2 to 4 sec for processing towards start of call.
Overall for me it's so so. Hardly met expectations.

Samsung Galaxy M30s, priced at 13999 was bought by me at 12499/- thanks to Amazon's amazing discount offers.
I've been using this phone for  more than 2 months now and can say with absolute confidence that I haven't got a sweeter deal on a smartphone.
So full disclosure: I trust the Samsung brand completely as their phones are of high-quality and durable, give great service and so when my old Samsung phone retired, I wanted to buy a new phone in the range of 10 to 15k with great battery life for online streaming, having a good enough display for reading books and watching content.
M30s checked all three boxes.

It's a budget phone with a long battery life; it can last at least 2 whole days (if you begin use when it's fully charged) even when you use wifi or mobile data for majority of the time. It comes with a fast charger and it takes a little over 2 hours to charge it from 20% to 100%. (Although I'm disappointed with the short length of the charging cable. Not practical at all)

Now coming to the screen size and display.
It is just perfect for people who prefer to read on their phones. The screen is amoled and the display is great for watching videos. The sound is clear and crisp especially when you put your earphones in and select the Dolby Atmos mode. Also, the 64GB memory is such an upgrade from my previous phone that I saved about 800 bucks on an SD card.

Another attractive feature is it's camera. 48MP is really ambitious for a medium range phone and the super slow-motion feature, live focus and hyperlapse (like a boomerang) are fun add-ons. Though the Selfie camera is just okay. Nothing to boast about. Same goes for the fingerprint reader.

I bought the blue gradient variety which is a colourful change from basic black and white phones so I just make do with a transparent cover to show off the nice shade of my M30s. All in all, I'm in love with my new phone and the best thing about it is that it is a budget phone but doesn't feel like it at all!

Amazon's service was impeccable and the delivery was on time and in perfect condition. I'm glad I chose this phone as my Diwali gift to myself!

Talking about this phone, this comes with great battery life and I can stream all my favorite songs and play games without worrying that it may go off. The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. My friends take my phone and go on clicking selfies. I already have 400 plus photos in my gallery. The storage capacity is not a worry either, thanks to the 128gb variant. The display is really very good. Everything so bright and nice. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I'm loving it! :)

Best mid range mobile from SAMSUNG.
Display 🖥️: sAMOLED FHD+ with good color reproduction watching movies is a joy.
Camera 📷:  works well but bokeh effect could be better, wide angle functionality and super slo mo video, and stabilized recording is good.
Selfie also come out ok.
Multitasking : didn't face any issue.
Gaming🎮: I'm not much into mobile gaming but I find it's good for casual gaming.
UI : One UI based on Android 9(pie) is breeze, fluent, functional and not like the previous UI on Samsung. Can be customised with themes etc.
Battery⚡: Yeah baby, bring it on with the 6000mah monster battery and the mobile doesn't feel as heavy and it was one of the main reason of this purchase. Charging with included 15w fast charger takes about 1.5 hours to fully charge the battery which I feel is good taking into consideration the battery capacity. Easily lasts 1.5 day for me.

For all those who saying no protection by reading gsmarena description ... read the second image of product, clearly says Corning gorilla glass 3.

Camera is awesome in daylight, portrait mode is much better than my s8plus, for low light switch on the night mode and keep ur hand steady.

Body is plastic but premium quality one. Buy amazon solimo "jelly case" in less than rs.100 for back protection.

Best part is amoled display, watching full hd videos is a joy. Stunning!

Vowifi aka wifi calling from day one on both jio n airtel. Meaning no network problem.

Battery last 2 days with moderate usage and 1.5days for heavy usage. To drain out battery in a day you need be a game addict.

This is the best family phone with awesome display, super backup n very nice portrait camera.
Not for people who like chinese dumb phone with hardware issues arising within a year or two &amp; backdoor opening for sending data to chinese govt masters. Neither it shows ads camouflaged as recommendation.

Tips: For free vpn use samsung max app.

The screen size and quality is really wonderful, camera quality and performance is very good. Fingerprint reader works well but many a times phone gets unlocked without reason. Face recognition works well. Battery life is very good, lasts through a full day of average usage, but charging is not as fast as I would have thought. The only negative in the phone is the audio. The Dolby feature works only when using headphones. But in speaker mode the volume could have been better. Overall, Samsung Galaxy M30s has been a good buy.

I m using this device by 7 days. Its working smoothly and fast with single charge per two days.
Its camara is performing nice , specifically wide angle shots .
Fingerprint sensor response is superfast.
Its black colour variant is more beautiful than other because its Camara box is black and it hides in black colour.
This device is not feeling heavy .
Its shape , design and Super amoled screen is attracting others too.
Really ,I feel it is true value for money.
Fast delivery and 10% instant less in price by sbi card is really make me feel like DIWALI.

I bought for amoled screen and 5 star for that. No other screen beats amoled..experience  is superior. .flip side - screen is prone to scratches. I hate putting screen guard but I am putting now as after a week usage screen shows some prominent
scratches. charger in box not 15w as claimed. Disappointed by camera quality..very sub standard n really don't match 48mp expectations.

Latest update-
Camera quality decreased dramatically after the update on 17.12.2019
Camera was weak before and now it is worse.!

Not a bad phone. But not that good either.
Camera is on weak side, especially 48mp. Normal pics seems better than 48mp clicks.
Front camera is bad, but you will get adjusted

Then why 3 stars?
Screen is superb and right now the phone is amazingly fast too.
I really love one ui and it's a superb piece of work.
I orderd the pearl white and i should request not to make the same mistake as i did.
The phone seems good in every other aspects.
Battery also doesnt seems to give the expected superb results...

It is not a SIM problem same SIM work on other phones.  I have restart the phone to get or make calls.  it work on 10 to 15 minutes after restart then again goes dead.  Every one calling to my number are not able to connect.  This was my first Samsung phone and I was disappointed.  Any one can give me some tips on how to fix this issue

This is a fabulous phone from Samsung that has a Huge Battery and display. I bought this phone for my mom and she is very happy with the Phone. With normal useage (without Games and facebook app installed), a fully charged phone could last for 2 days. The Phone is very fast and I did not experience any lag. Fingerprint is spot on.  Camera is just average (What you pay for is what you get). And the best part is that the SAR (Radiation from the phone) is 0.43 when compared to Cheap Chinese Phones which is usually between 1.2 to 1.5.
If your budget is around 15,000 INR just go for it. You will not regret.

Pros- This phone is a beast! It comes with 4gigs of RAM and 6000 mAh battery which looks  like is going to last for 2 days straight with one full charge cycle. The display is amazing and it looks even more beautiful with night mode on 😌 Definitely an amazing choice for a budget phone! There is no lag whatsoever, I’m loving it so far.

Cons- I’m not really very happy with the camera. For some reason , both the front and rear camera, smudges the pixels together and makes the picture look a little weird. It is still an amazing choice for casual photography though! 😄👌

1st of all. bad built quality means it's not durable. Back panel of this device looks cheap. No premium feel. Display quality is great bcz of super amoled display. But front selfie is average and back camera is just bad as 48mp samsung gm1 sensor. It takes really washed out photos. Processor is somewhere around snapdragon 675 and 712. which is good. But you'll notice some lags in your daily usage. Call quality is great but loudspeaker is not that much loud. Battery 6000mah is great and it comes with 15watt fast charger. But it takes more than 3 hours to charge this phone. Fingerprint reader is slow. I used this phone for 1week and my experience is really bad with this phone. I don't like it. As i couldn't return this phone so i sold this on cashify for 9400rs. if you take my suggestion don't buy this phone. Go for Realme 5 pro, Xioami Note 8 Pro, Vivo z1 pro, Vivo Z1x, Realme Xt, Poco F1 etc etc.. So don't waste your hard earned money, Choose smartly.

Its the fastest delivery by Amazon to my place well done for it,also brand new phone is roundy in shape without cover so have to be gripped well to hold otherwise it will slip,setup is easy and all functions also working fine as per now,i am not happy with cost cutting tech of Samsung as charging wire is much smaller (and its getting smaller with every new launch).also no back temp back cover and headphone are disappointing factors at this price range.charging speed is good and battery backup is also good no issue here,its a balanced phone for normal use .

Excellent phone. Received 2 days ago. Very attractive and good looking. Inspite of plastic back cover, the looks are very premium and sturdy.
1 .Finger print smudging is very less.
2. Display is very cripsy and colors are very natural.
3. Phone is extremely low weight keeping in view 6000 MAH battery.
4. Processor is very fast. But a little bit of heating observed on gaming. Nothing serious.
5. Camera is excellant. Photos taken are very good. Has to check low light photos.
6. One UI is very polished and very little bloatware. Even some unnecessary samsung software is omitted.
7. Battery backup is very good. Still using without charging for 48 hours.
8. RAM management is good left with 3 GB on my 6GB varient even after plenty of apps running.
9. Not able to find any problems till now. Will update if any thing found.

Bought this piece  as an upgrade for my sweetheart's phone. She was using a Galaxy Note3 Neo (single sim) phone for past 6 years. Configuring the M30 and transferring her old contacts as well as apps was smooth. She is happy with her M30. So I am the happiest person on earth! Particularly likable is the battery life. Strongly recommended, if you want a not-so-costly smart mobile phone, with excellent photographic capability.  Once she gets used to the finger print utility, I may be tempted to give 5 stars for that too! Lovely product. No doubts in my mind, I am glad to have purchased it.

The product looks good and delivered by amazon on time but after 2 days of usage the got automatically gets switching off while using. I have asked Amazon to replace or refund the money but as per policy they can replace the Product, to replace the product they are conducting a mobile inspection which is pathetic, awful. I have raised the request when an issue occurred amazon support team told mobile inspection rep will come on a specified day, the inspection rep came as scheduled but he didn't do any inspection, the rep just switch on the mobile and said mobile is working, I have told to him mobile is getting switched off randomly but he didn't bother. After fighting with Amazon support they arranged another rep but he didn't come for inspection and update the status user contactable.

This is my first purchase of Samsung mobile. Promisingly i'm saying after 2 months usage things are mind blowing at this price range, really awesome mobile phone, if you want get mobile phone at this price range you can just nod the head and go for it casually 3 days of battery life. Really samsung keeps the promise what they offers, Hat's off... #monsterbattery but mobile itself monster. In all aspects of Clarity, Camera, Big battery,performance you can go for it.. I'm loving this mobile a lott...

Samsung manufactured Barmuda Triangle galaxy M30s smartphone in which all midrange brand smartphone crashed.
M30s wins midrange smartphone race only due to it's most required Three smart features
1. Brand samsung , 2. Super amoled display (easy to view in sunlight) 3. Huge 6000mah battery.
Samsung Exynos performs same as flagship processors in, so nothing matters for flagship.
Also M30S A1 High definition triple camera captures very crystal clear images or shoots real bright coloured videos .
So samsung is samsung.

Screen broken with a mild slip from the hand within few days of purchase..it's so slippery and delicate as the screen broken badly in very first drop from hand. Thanks to Acko protection came with phone, I could get the screen replaced without any hussles. Hence request to use 3D screen protector and a case immediately after you purchase this.Performance,Camera, call quality, battery all are in par with competitive models. Super AmoLED Screen makes it so beautiful to watch HD videos, slow motion and 4K recording works perfectly... except that you cannot even do basic editing like in MI phones.You need to purchase external applications for basic video editing.Thats the only problem I felt.

Likes:
Good phone in this price range.

Dislikes:
1. CAMERA: Photo quality is not that great. Also camera app does not provide option to add date timestamp. Camera app does not even have option to use finger sensor to capture selfie photos (very much required for selfie photos).

2. NETWORK : shows no or very poor network signal. If someone is calling, caller gets out of coverage areas response quite often no matter what operator it is. My other phone shows good signal for the same SIM.

3. BACK COVER : Not a good quality back cover. It sounds chit chit while holding the phone tight.

Samsung nailed it with this phone delivering all the features at this price range.
Battery is the main selling point here - it is absolutely hard to drain this phone completely given the battery size and the mid range chipset.
Camera is good in normal lighting conditions but struggles a bit in low light. But that's not a deal breaker especially for people who are not interested in taking a lot of pictures.
The screen is wonderful which not a surprise since it's coming from Samsung. And while performance is not the best, when comparing to flagships one must consider the price and this phone doesn't disappoint. There's no lag when using this phone.
Coming to UI, Samsung's One UI is definitely the best at this price. I'd prefer One UI anyday, after Oxygen OS and stock Android, over any other UI. It's clean and simple to use and just the same you get on Samsung's flagship devices.
This is definitely the go to phone for anyone whose budget is under 15k.

Real true facts about this phone after using it for 2 months,
Cons-
Camera in 48 MP MODE TAKES AROUND  10 seconds  to save the image, so you will be able to shoot continuously , 48 mp is not really 48 as f/2.0, where as good camera should have at least f/1.8.
Front  camera is pathetic images are not sharp at all.
When viewing gallery it images to refresh,
Phones hangs repeatedly
Battery is supposed be best part but fast charging  is very slow it will take at least 3 hrs to charge &amp; is not at par as marketed  of being 6000mah.
Don't  waste your money on Samsung's  honey trap, not value for money ,if you buy you bear the guilt everyday of buying this phone.

The performance and the features are just amazing. When you compare the features with the price, the features far outweigh the price. To mention a few, the finger print sensor functions at supersonic speed, the battery is,no doubt, a giant and lasts two days easily and I am awestruck with the quality of the pictures I shot with this phone.
The phone responds with fairly good speed to the touch of your finger. Samsung has not let you down in any aspect so far as this phone is concerned. I think Samsung has given full thought even to the minute details. One can definitely go in for this phone, in this price segment.

Samsung has come long way since they upgraded from plastic to metal.
This one particularly is value for money, every penny is worth.
One less star for camera since telephoto performance is not as expected.
Attached pics of phone itself and from camera of phone itself. Not uploading telephoto pic as need to explore the clear and sunny landscape.
Besides that, indoor, outdoor close up are par excellent than rivals.
Smooth operation, no lack of performance.
Feels premium phone and overall 5* product.

People who want their phones to not run out of battery even after heavy usage and don't want to run to socket even for half an hour, use your phone while connected to a charger. Then this is the perfect phone for you. I switch on my Bluetooth, GPS and mobile data, from morning to night and I play games moderately, watch YouTube, Prime video for 2 to 3 hours at HD and I still have 30% Battery by the time I sleep. This is a kind of luxury to have, to not worry about running out of battery. And the display is gorgeous. The front camera could  have been better, but I am not a selfie person. So I could live with that or you can wait to get a GCam which works for all the cases as the sensors both front and back are great so you could get decent picture quality. The finger print sensor is fast but it works about 8.5 of 10 times 😅.

Hello guy's,
This review  I am giving  after 1month of use.
So there is nothing good about this phone except it have one battery life.

Cons:
1. Camera: worst quality of pics and it's also take a huge amount of space.
2. Processor: its says it have latest processor but it not seems so, apps take time to open, ram is almost full even background apps have been stopped.
3. Build: build quality is also average
4. Network: its have a great network issue its loose network when your wifi is also ON. Also where other's phones have good network quality its show only 2 towers .
5. Most importantly I thought Samsung have upgraded its low range under 20k phone but it not seems so.. worst phone ever...

Purchased a Samsung galaxy m30s mobile from Amazon.  Features of this phone are undoubtedly good, but one teething problems is severely disturbing the user experience is that it has a unique problem. It has inbuilt ads, which very frequently pop up and disturb your view. Your mobile viewing gets disrupted on sudden appearance of full screen ads on your display. This is troubling me very much and also it's battery gets heated, hence I am giving it single star rating.

After using about 3 weeks I can tell that the camera is not 48 megapixle at all. Battery life is somehow good I can use it for almost 1.5 day with 100 percent charge with heavy works like data and watching video etc.
Selfie camera is not good and crispy. Rear camera take photos like 13mega pixel cameras. And it's blurry. My LG G4 has more quality photos with 16MP Camera.
In night and low light camera is almost useless and all blurs. And there is no manual option for Shutter speed or focus in pro mode.
Performance of phone is good and without any lag. I don't play games on phone.
Some camera options are cool like doodle. Hyperlapse. Slow motions and etc.

So, anyway I did. Got it at 11.6K after cashback and bank offer.
Display: amazing! beautiful, crisp. One of the best display at this price.
Battery: 6kmAh. What can I say. It doesn't die. I got 10:30hrs of screen on time on full charge. (Screenshot attached)
Processor: The Exynos 9611 is good, it handles everyday task easily.
Gaming: PUBG is set to HDR by befault (surprising), runs good on HDR, but you'll notice framedrops, but overall it's nice.
Speaker: it isn't very loud, but is good enough.
Camera: it's good. The normal and 48MP picture look same but the 48mp ones have more details. The Wide angle lens is awesome. It also has Super Slo-Mo and a Slo-Mo mode, both record in 240fps, I don't know what's the difference but super Slo-Mo looks better.
Video: it can shoot in 4K, plus you can shoot video with its wide angle lens which is an amazing feature.
That's all, these are the first impressions, I'll add if something comes up.

Great battery back up.
Fast charging works as described
Camera is ok, I was expecting much more.
Stunning display.
Compact and light weight ( I expected more wieght CZ of 6000mah battery)
Budget phone.
Cons:  headphone jack given at down side
6000 mAh battery and budget + amazon offer makes this mobile a killer buy!

A true monster. Very satisfied with battery life and camera quality which were my primary requisites for choosing the mobile. Very stylish design. Curved screen with gorilla glass makes the display wonderful. I have been Samsung user for last 8 years plus. Wanted to try a different brand this time, yet ended up with Samsung again and happy with the purchase.
The only disappointment is that they stopped providing earphone with mobile. And it has a C type charger, so gone are those days when you did not bother to carry your charger along to your friend's or relative's place

I have always avoided purchasing a Samsung mobile, in the last 10+ years never got one, bought this just for the cost and specs, but I am sorry to say - it was a wrong decision,

The product is CHEAP, PLASTIC, SMUDGY, SLIPPERY, FEELS LIKE A TOY....its a SICK FEELING!

Secondly, I do not know what is the meaning of Made for India - does it mean this phone does not work in international networks - meaning out of the country?

My serious recommendation, If you can avoid it please do - DO NO BUY THIS, unless you are a hardcore Samsung fan!

I will review this phone or about this phone in 3 parts :-
So this is the first part
1. Thank you amazon for exchanging this product, I at first ordered this phone on 28th September 2019 at 12:00 PM sharp and got the product within 12 hours which is bloody fast for me and I liked it, but after receiving this product i really faced a huge problem with its camera, esp with the wide angle lense, because when ever I am shooting my videos or taking photos by using the wide angle lense then suddenly I saw there was a huge color drop and light drop, even I was multiple noise in the photos and in the videos that I was shooting with it, because the only reason I bought this phone was only to shoot my youtube music videos with it and even I shot one too, but i was not happy with the camera. Then after my shoot was over I asked Amazon for phone check up and they did send a person over, so that specialized person from qidgi saw this phone and he told me that there might be a problem with the in built camera software and may be there can also be a problem with the camera too. Then that person told Amazon about it and also for a refund of this phone, after that I constantly kept touch with amazon and at last yesterday I received a new phone in exchange of the faulty one and now I am a big fan of Amazon and i trust them.

So on this first part I genuinely want to Express my gratitude and also thank you amazon for keeping this faith a trust.

In my next reviews  I will review the phone only

For now, I can only compare the M30s with the Asus Zenfone 5z and a OnePlus 3T, both of which 'were' flagships of the respective brands. In the past I have used Motorolas exclusively. I 'was' a big Motorola fan and consider stock android as the best user experience on a smartphone.

Pros
1. Display 5/5 – Big, Beautiful but more importantly a well-calibrated one. It's easily better than the Oppo and Vivo AMOLED implementations, simply because Samsung has taken the pains to somehow calibrate each unit.

2. Ergonomics 5/5 – You are unlikely to call this device bulky or cumbersome for one-handed use because of the 20:9 aspect ratio, excellent weight management and OneUI optimisations for one-handed use.

3. Battery Life 4/5 – 11-12hrs SoT for me i.e. 1.5days use. Frankly, it's a bit disappointing considering that my older Motorolas gave 6-8hrs on 13nm architecture SoCs, had 2,700-3,000 mah batteries and had less efficient LCD panels. At 6,000mah it should've given close to 14hr SoT, for my use-case.

4. Performance 5/5 – Very fast app opening speeds! Compares very well with the Snapdragon 821 powered and phenomenally well optimized OnePlus 3T. Falls short of the Asus 5z, which is a no-brainer. RAM management is decent too, of the 4GB RAM I tend to have 1.5GB free. 8-10 non-game apps are typically always in memory. UFS 2.1 is a Big leap for those of us upgrading from eMMC storage. This is particularly noticeable in both app opening speeds as well as in the gallery app where Images and Video thumbnails load instantly. Deleting is also super fast!

5. Touch Response 5/5 – Fast, precise, with low latency. Particularly noticeable on the keyboard, quick toggle menu, as well as when knocking off notifications or deleting feeds on say, the Chrome browser. Faster animations further this experience.

6. One UI 3.5/5 – It's difficult to rate it because I've ALWAYS used stock android. And although I enjoy the add-ons OneUI comes with I also miss the clean, fluid, conflict-free experience that stock android is known for. Mind you, this is FAR better than the Chinese ROMs that I tried out in offline stores; ColorOS, FuntouchOS, MIUI and even ZenUI. OneUI is less obtrusive, cleaner, has no ads and is easier to use one-handed. OneUI isn't flawless, I have experienced app crashes (Tata Sky and Palabre) on when I never faced any issues with them with my previous phones. It does ship with bloatware, asks for a LOT of permissions, has unrequired 'suggestions'. Though all of that can be shut down within 5mins. What you do have to put up with is – stutters. You see them from time to time. It may not be a deal breaker, but yes it's clearly a step-down from stock android. For me, if Stock android is 100... Oxygen OS gets a 100 too, One UI gets 85 and ZenUI gets 75. The other Chinese skins (MIUI, ColorOS, FuntouchOS) are definitely far more heavily modified and further away from the core experience android is known for.

7. Call Quality and Cellular Reception 5/5 – I actually placed calls from all the weak spots at home where signals drop to just 1 bar. Thankfully the M30s doesn't drop signals more than other phones that I've used in fact it's a shade better than the Motorolas I had previously. It's not a mind-blowing signal-catcher either, but yes I do get internet on my Jio sim where sometimes the other phones would struggle. Call quality was Good too, slightly better than the 5z but just short of the OnePlus 3T. Compared to 5z, the sound is sharper (but never sibilant) as opposed to being slightly more muffled and recessed in the upper frequencies.

8. Reliability/Peace of mind and a vast Service network.

Cons
1. Build quality 3/5 – Its a unibody plastic build but a rather flimsy grade of plastic has been used. You can feel and at times also hear the plastic flex next to the power button and the fingerprint scanner. The button themselves have a short travel and satisfactory tactility. Most Chinese phones (which I checked out at offline stores) offer a better build and have Gorilla Glass too, which is rated higher than Schott or Asahi's dragontail (used here), especially in terms of drop protection. For scratch resistance this should be ok, hopefully.

2. Charging performance 2/5 – 2hrs 30mins is very 2015 (6,000 mah, I know). Perhaps an 18w charger helps shave off 15mins or so?, I'll give an update on that. What's more irksome is that if you are using the phone while charging it significantly slows down charging speed (3.5hrs or so!), this is a difference you can't miss. It does not happen on the other devices I have at home, to this extent.

3. Cameras 2/5 – I've used SLRs/DSLRs for over 2 decades so I understand a thing or two. Which also means I don't expect phones, especially at this price point to do great. Even with toned down expectations the cameras are rather poor. The '48mp' Detail is absent, dynamic range mediocre and there's over sharpening/ringing too, though colours are thankfully more natural than I expected from Samsung. Frankly, the '48mp', '64mp', '108mp' number dropping these days is wayyy deep into gimmicky territory because these things at best may be a tad better than older 12/16mp modules, when implemented right. I can only say that it's nowhere near the 12mp primary camera on the Asus 5z (especially with gCam, at night). What's good is the Video Stability &amp; super slow motion feature. Stabilization is actually better than the other two, especially surprising if you know that both 5z &amp; 3t have OIS, this does not! I will update this section if/when I can compare it against its class.

4. LTE speeds over Jio 2.5/5 – A bit disappointing actually. Here it's more like the 6-series from 2018. Even with UFS 2.1, app downloading over Jio was very similar to the older phones I've used. Nowhere close to the 3t, leave alone 5z. Mind you, the Snapdragon 7-series is FAR closer to the 835/845 on this category.

5. Heapdhone quality 3/5 – I'm not a hardcore audiophile but I've spent a small fortune on audio over the years. The m30s has a lively presentation with good dynamics and respectable detail but the frequency response isn't flat. The bass is clearly boosted and the upper frequencies are muted. Its definitely a flavoured sound unlike my Moto G5 Plus which had phenomenally clean audio and superb stereo separation (price no bar!), with my Audio Technica ath-m50, Soundmagic e10c and Beyerdynamic Byron I never had a complaint. The M30s has better detail for sure but it's a more central ('in your head'), less neutral sound. The Hidizs Sonata HD is a good option if you want a solid upgrade for around 2-2.5k, if you want to go cheaper still try the pixel Type-C to 3.5mm dongle there's a lot of praise for it and it's available for just 1.3k or so.

6. Lack of XDA love – The XDA community showers tons of love to Snapdragon powered phones in making them cleaner/slicker/customizable with Custom ROMs because Exynos is locked out by Samsung :(

7. Speaker performance – Not bad but certainly nothing above mediocre. At least it's not that ear piercing, shrill sound that some models at this price point are plagued with and its loud too. OnePlus 3T has a significantly cleaner, tighter output. I won't even bother drawing a comparison with the 5z ;)

8. Android Update track record – I found that Samsung has one of the slowest update speeds, 6-10 months after official release (if you're lucky!). Which probably means no Android 10 until March 2020 :( May be things change in the OneUI era?

First impressions, a full 5/5.
I'll update with Long-term findings.

--- 7th October, 2019. 1-week update ---

One UI experience.
So I've begun to appreciate OneUI in its entirety. The stutters have reduced, I guess when the phone was new there was a lot happening in the background. Besides, some of the intrusive stuff was still running which I've since force stopped and disabled.

The features that I think are great additions over stock android...
1. Open in pop-up view – True multitasking! A huge plus in my book.
2. Always on display – A great feature to have on an AMOLED display and a 6,000mah battery.
3. The screenshot toolbar – it's well designed and the added functionality is much appreciated.
4. Gesture based quick app switcher – A neat and well implemented way of quickly moving through apps
5. 9-band Equaliser – The presets and the fully customizable graphic equaliser have system wide effect over audio, a very underrated feature.
6. Dark/Night mode – Android 10 will bring this at the system level. But it doesn't hurt to have it at some level already, even if its only for the system apps.

What I think are half-baked or unrequired features...
1. Aggressive auto brightness – The ambient light sensor almost always chooses a brighter than required output.
2. Assistive touch – 2 pages to swipe through is a good idea but most of it is of absolutely no use! And there's no option to customise it either.
3. Screenshot shortcuts – They've given 3 bad ways of doing it. And the award for the worst experience goes to... "Palm swipe"! Not only is it inconsistent but also senselessly cumbersome. 3-finger swipe on my Motorola worked flawlessly and was faster too. I tried the Assistive touch but that always-on-screen button soon became an eyesore. So I ended up with the Power button + Volume down key :(

All my other 'first impressions' remain unchanged.

A piece of advice for prospective buyers:
If the negative reviews confuse you, please understand this – The negative reviews are by people who have either...
1. Bought the device for the wrong reasons.
2. Or have unrealistic expectations from a device that was available under 12k, at launch.
3. Or have a genuine issue with a bad unit (a very small percentage).
4. Or are paid trolls!
Most of the negative reviews seem to fall in category 1. &amp; 2.

The USPs of this device are...
1. A Very Very good display – It's accurate, most cheap AMOLED sporting devices are not. Which is why you get unnatural skin tones and unrealistic greens/reds with some other mid-range phones (Mi A3, Realme XT, Vivo z1x etc.)
2. One UI – A FAR cleaner alternative to Chinese skins/ROMs
3. Excellent battery life – 11/12hrs of SoT!
4. Fast app opening speeds and RAM management
5. Reliability!

I ordered a case but it hasn't been delivered yet.
Despite that there's not one scratch on the display or the back!

You will be disappointed if you are buying this device particularly for...
1. Build quality
2. or Camera performance
3. or Charging speed
4. or Superfast updates
5. or for making NFC payments (via Google pay or Samsung pay). Though not many outlets accept this in India, at least not in Tier 2 cities, as of 2019.

Also remember that all other alternatives will come with their own set of drawbacks too.
Can't have it all, not in 2019 at least.

Rating unchanged, fully satisfied "for the price paid!"

Battery life is a key in this phone. You will never regret your choice if you opt this phone for bigger battery with better performance. This phone provided decent camaera performance at price point of 13-16 K. I think this is the best phone in this price range. Display is very bright which gives better gaming experience. Sound quality is also good. I have not observed any lag till now with regular usage. Additional storage with dedicated SD card slot along side dual sim will allow you to get additional storage which is rare now a days in many phone.

Amazing product by Samsung. Before I used to get angry that Samsung never released best product under budget. But after this my view on Samsung changed. You can say there is many out but for brand value you can rely on Samsung. Fast delivery by Amazon ordered Separately 28th afternoon got product at 8:45 am on Sep 29th.
Thank you Amazon. You never cease to Amaze.
First thing-there is no flash sale to eyewash. Many other showoff brands make flash sale even they have stock to fool customers. I tried in many flash sale but all in vain, in secs their products sold out which is very irritating.
Second - Monster battery. Who will give 6000mah battery in this time..many phones are under 4000 or under 5000 and giving fast charging and claim 1:30 hour full charge...who need those fast charging if already a monster battery is there which is enough for 2 days tasks. Also 15 watts fast charging which charges phone in 2:30 hrs.
I used continuesly after full charge for 16 hours screen on time including a night idle time.
Third - There is no other brand give this 6.4 inch Super Amoled screen with that much clarity..watching movies and streaming media apps are a delight on this. Always on screen super feature. resolution is bigger (1080x2400- 20:9 ratio) than other brands which have fullhd +  at 1080x 2340. Split screen feature. Screen replacement guarantee by acko.
Fourth - This does not have a classy back panel....who wants that when you are going to protect back with back cases...so ignore that. Front is gorilla glass 3 protected that's fine for me. I got opal black colour which is awesome.
Fifth - Camera that is good when you set some settings and takes perfect pictures. Steady video and slow-motion video is awesome.
Sixth: Fast processor Exynos 9611 it has 4 cores running at 2.3Ghz and 4 cores at 1.7Ghz. Running in Pie version and no ads were found in UI
Optimisation is good.
Seventh- gaming -not installed pubg. Installed Freefire which ran smoothly. game booster feature is good.
Eight: FM radio with recording and RDS. RDS feature gives radio station details on screen which you don't find it most of the brands. Recording available for FM and calls. Dolby Atmos whao what a feature I hear all the sound in a movie that too have very minute details. I watched Crawl movie where sudden sounds made me jump. Dolby Atmos only on regular and Bluetooth headsets. Speaker quality is good when used speaker phone and ringtone. Earpiece also sounded good.
Ninth - dual sim slots with dedicated memory slot that is rarely available in few brands. Memory can be expanded to 1 tb but in paper it's 512gb that's cool right.

Will put more ...

If you're looking into getting a new smartphone you might find all the technical lingo a wee bit confusing.There are so many technological specs associated with buying a phone that knowing what's what can be tough. Not to worry though, I hope my user experience helps in solving your query.

TOP SPECS:
One of the most important specs on a cell phone is the CPU or processing spec.Basically, the CPU of your phone is sort of like the brain of a human body, and the more powerful the BRAIN is, the faster and more responsive your phone will be.As phones become more powerful, processors are getting into dual core &amp; quad core territory .This MONSTER comes with Android v9.0 Pie operating system with 2.3GHz + 1.7GHz Exynos 9611 octa core processor .So, it makes this a top end phone in this price bracket as top end phone these days are getting over 2GHz of power.I have purchased the 6GB RAM/128 GB storage - opal black colour,For a budget killer smart phone the build quality is superb
The back side is a dual colour and has a mixture of turquoise blue.

DISPLAY:
Screen material makes a big difference too. Phones from a "Fruit named Company" still have LCD displays, which in today's time is just not fine. But with the new Samsung M30s we get (6.4-inch) FHD SUPER AMOLED + capacitive touchscreen with 2340 x 1080 pixels resolution 16M color support.With the new SUPER AMOLED technology tend to produce screens that are a tad brighter and have better colour reproduction.

CAMERA:
Once considered a luxury in smartphones, the camera is now an integral part of smartphones.There is a whole lot more to any camera than megapixels.The quality of the lens,the camera software and the presence of options like autofocus and different scene settings make a world of difference.Samsung M30s comes with 48MP + 8MP + 5MP triple rear camera | 16MP front facing camera.Photos taken from M30s are decent and look good on the phone's SUPER AMOLED display, Daylight shots are average and on zooming the stored image it gets grainy. You will have to be patient with this phone while getting the best from its camera.

MONSTROUS BATTERY:
The battery determines how long your phone keeps working on a single charge. As phones get bigger, so do their batteries.Battery life is the highlight of the Samsung Galaxy M30s and the 6000mAh battery does help this smartphone going on for a very very long time before it needs to be plugged in. While battery life varies a lot depending on how you use a phone, I tested this phone's battery by running PUBG on it that too on high preset mode, I played for 30 mins and noticed a 6 percent battery drain, The phone did not get warm which was impressive to set a benchmark.

VERDICT:
Great phone with a 6000mAh monstrous battery.
Best display so far for a phone in under 20,000 price bracket.
Fantastic performance at multi tasking.
Only complain/disappointment :Samsung should've provided earphones and a mobile case.

Phone seems of a premium quality looks n feel wise (basis the price range). Purchased it for my Mother. Am a One Plus Fan and a loyal customer, however Samsung impressed me with this phone. Not sure if it came pre loaded with Android 10, however after setting up phone when looked for Update found Android 10 update. With only limited usage I could only figure out one Con: Type C charging not there, possibly  as it has big battery. Rest will update upon more usage.

Everything looks above average near to premium about this budget phone.
As per my opinion this was 1st revolutionary budget device made by Samsung..
Apart from some flaws(even flagship phones have some flaws) this is best mid range device that i want to suggest.

* Pros :- Look,Back camera design,Feel,Display (Best in Class), Battery,Audio Quality,Camera (in most cases like Slow motion videos, super steady mode,colour reproduction),you get Samsung Brand,not that heavy on pocket as well as in hands too ;)

* Cons :- A bit improvement in picture quality of camera like when you zoom the image all you see is pixels, i think its not utilizing 48mp properly (Minor con)

Rest Everything is Good.
Nice Product by SAMSUNG we need more such devices in this range .

Honest review : Bought this phone today.. found it in good shape in delivery box, no scracthes and nothing. This phone is quite heavt compared to others. Product is nice, battery is powerful, camera is also good. As it was in updating mode, it got quite a little bit hot but it was due to update and all. Main thing or disadvantage you can say is that it is not powered by knox ( means it doesnt have samsung pay mini, secure folder etc ). charging cable is small as compared to others. Lock screen swiping doesnt lag. Video quality is also good.

Product rating : 4/5 ( can be even better if it had knox )

5. Affordable as compared to ANY Pro Version( With Dolby Atom Sound)

A simple ome statement review. Dont buy M series.
I habe both M30 and M30s, M30 - i purchased M30 few months back and after using it for few month i was really impressed by its battery life so i purchased M30s for a family member of mine. Of late M30 has started hanging and the touch screen either does not respond or it does not respond to ur particular touch actions (as if it has lost it claibration ). Now my M30s is havig the same problems.

Here I got some important points if you are looking for this product. PS. I am a verified buyer. (I am NOT paid for this review).
1. The all-round PERFORMANCE was amazing, but if you are looking for high-end gaming (like playing PUBG-M/COD-M or related to that based game) then it will serve you more than average performance. According to the budget, this will be the perfect Samsung for gaming.
2. According to my perception, the CAMERA was not soo clear in this budget. If you are like completely photo addicted, then this phone may not serve you at that level in the form of a better camera. But it will give you that clarity what Samsung has claimed.
3. Looking for better BATTERY? Go for it. It will not disappoint you due to a 6k mAH battery.
4. Going for showoff? This will help you get noticed with its shiny multi-colored back.
5. The sound quality was better than expected so you can play music/games without using external speakers, earphones.
6. U infinity display 60Hz screen. Almost 6" AMOLED display.
7. C-Type Fast charging, but you will need to buy fast charger separately. Samsung will provide you the standard charger.

END OF THE REVIEW
ENJOY!!!

Got this phone after using MiA2 for a year. Two things about this phone are absy awesome : the display and battery. Of course, the other things are almost similar to my earlier phone with the network reception actually better than MiA2 (contrary to what people are actually complaining). The haptic feedback although missing in the native applications can be turned on by third party apps. No heating issues either. The lack of gorilla glass for the screen might be a matter of concern but I got one year free screen replacement offer from Amazon during the sale.

Battery is awesome...camera is okay has some good features though...finger sensor is delayed...I do miss some features of my old phone like a vibration when the call is picked up...I am not happy with the phone..the more I use it the more unhappy its making me...it takes 2 hrs to charge the phone to 100% from 15% not sure how it's a fast charging phone...do not buy this phone I had also bought a vivo u10 which was launched along with this phone...at half price it's far better than this one...my mistake was that I went for the brand called Samsung

At this price point of view i thought it's good bet but the build quality is so poor. Most of the cases which i saw that the back panel is not fit properly. Samsung is the leading brand in mobile industries i never expected like this. Please return if you have bought in Amazon Great Indian Festival and think another option to buy new phones.

After Using Nearly a month, its time for a review as simple as possible.

Why to buy:
1. Battery
2. Display
3. Camera
4. Brand
5. Price
6. Storage and RAM option

Why not to buy:
1. Battery doesn't feel like 6000 and charging is not that fast
2. Body quality is not premium but ok for the price
3. its good to protect the display with a good screen protector

My Advice: Its always your opinion is 1st.. read few other reviews and go for it.

Thank You

The phone is amazing. I can play pubg all day watch videos on it and keep the internet running with the screen on and it won't die on me. And the 48MP camera and the Ultra Wide cam are an epic addition. The only thing that bothered me was that the phone doesn't come with a screengaurd and a cover. Other than that everything is amazing. For the price it is at? It gives more than it should. The charger could be a bit faster but considering I just need to charge it at night, and then the whole day I can use it is pretty amazing. I'm pretty sure if I used it like other people do it might last me more than 2 days without charging. Buy it. It's amazing.

Superb Display and battery life - with best n class Samsung UI
smooth operation switching between apps, great touch experience fluid and smooth.
The display is very remarkable  outstanding
auto-brightness is weak in sunlight it takes time to adjust
Camera quality is ok in 48MP as there is no stabilizer after click it takes 3 sec time to save the image but in other mode, it saves quickly good music output better than note 8 which I am using as second phone.

outdoor photo quality is good but indoor still struggle due to not having image stabilizer

Good value for money phone in this price range those who want good display, battery life, music quality output this is good to go phone however average camera quality.

thank you

overall phone is nice and good enough, but cannot compare performance of poco f1, which has blazing fast SD845, which m30s cannot match.

i bought m30s only because of its big battery size, but its kinda dissapointing, as its 6000 mah battery lasts max 2 days with my normal usage where with my poco f1 which had 4000 mah lasted 2.5-3 days, so i kinda feel cheated and regret switching to m30s, as neither performance nor battery performance is upto mark compared what its suppose to be.

Main highlight was camera and battery but camera performance in low lighting is worst. Battery backup is ok but fast charging is taking too much time. It has  high expectations but getting huge disappointment by my side

Well , I have been using the phone for almost three months now.
I must say that Samsung Galaxy M30s is best in class phone with the prize band of below 13k.
I will start with the features that I like the most :
1. 6000 mAh battery gives a real boost to the phone. Even with the kind of decent usage I had, it was heartening to see that full 🔋 charge lasted for 48hrs
2. 6.4 inch display gives this phone an edge over others in the price band.
3. Camera quality is actually very impressive.
4. There isn't any lag that I have experienced so far.
If I pushed to corner to really mention one downside I would say that it is not the lightest one which is kind of understandable for a phone with 6000 mAh .
All in all it was a good buy for me. Bought 4GB/64GB version at an effective price of 11600 during Great India Amazon sale  ( after all applicable discounts and cashbacks ).
Phone was delivered within 2 days so I was delighted.
I am loving it.

It's really best for its price according to me it really best in camera,performamce I play pubg and it's really smooth (smooth and ultra) and it even run very good till hd but on hdrnit lags
Well I always play on smooth so it's best for me
It's 6gb ram and 128gb rom variant
Very nice camera and I love slow motion and live focus (bokeh) the edge detection is  amazing even on very fluffy hairs
Body is very nice curve on edge and very light even having 6000mah
Battery is very good, I play pubg continueous on 100% battery about 3.5 hours later it'd battery is still remain about 58 to 57% which is really nice

I really love this device thats perfect its like beast
Ill give overall 10/10

I am a regular iPhone user, very reluctant to switch. The biggest complaint I had with iPhone was its pathetic battery followed by suboptimal camera. I made a decision to switch to Android as getting an iPhone upgrade costs a fortune again. After some research Galaxy M30s seemed to meet my requirements. Been using it for a couple of weeks now. Very happy with it, especially battery that lasts 2 full days without charge and moderate use. Never felt so relieved. Bye bye power bank and welcome M30s! Very decent choice at an affordable price.

Good phone with amazing specs:
Got it for ₹11,600/- on great indian festival. I have been using it for past 10 days..
I couldn't find any problems yet..

Pros:
~Amazing display:
6.4"sAMOLED  FHD+ display, night mode, always on display,
~The weight distribution and inhand feeling are amazing:
 you won't feel that it weigh188g. I don't like phones which is bulkier and heavy.. my bro has redmi 7 pro.. even if its only ~184g it feels more heavier than this one due to its lack of good ergonomics.
~Good BATTERY backup:
 I heard it will last for 2 or even 3 days for light or normal uses.. but for me it will last for an entire day with heavy use. And for 1.5day (~30hrs) for my normal use.( For a better idea. It consumes 5% for 20mins of pubg)
~charging time for 1-100% is around 2.30-2.50hrs ( i.e 20% in 30mins)
~Camera: Camera is good.
But n ot as good as the 48MP cam in redmi 7 pro, realme 5 pro, etc coz it has  samsung's camera sensor+exynos processor not sony+snapdragon
~Face unlock is quick and the display light is enough to unlock with face in dark too.
~Sound is Loud and good quality.. not great though.
~One UI is user friendly.

Cons:-
×finger print sensor is slow
×camera could have been better
× I had issues with Proximity sensor. But it got fixed after turn the proximity sensor off and on again(Restart to apply changes).
×Built quality isn't so good.. especially the plastic back panel. It will make some 'tik' sound some times. (Hope it will get fixed by using a back cover).
× No gorilla glass or any other extra protection on screen.( But you will get 1yr screen replacement warranty on this item on great indian festival)
×No back pouch or screen guard is provided in the box.

Final verdict: its a great phone under 14K
Don't think twice if you would get it for 11,600 or 12,600 on special sales. But if you are looking for a good camera + better performance then go for realme 5 pro or any similar phones.. but then you will only get IPS LCD display.

Not good better to go with A series this is just like a scam
-They told u 48 mp camera nope its not even comparable with my J7 2016 model...
-They yold u fastest processor are u kidding me i feel no diff even sometimes apps respond late if you spend 14k then spend more 2 or 3k and go for another...
-Bettray is the only thing which is good but hey you can buy it from cyska...
-Fingerprint wrost if you put smallest drop of water it will not work then even shutter time is half a sec. So nope !!!!!
If you want that phone should  work perfectly for next 3 yrs nope this phone doesn't it will running behind morden tech you will expect only 1.5 yrs from this phone....

Pros
*display is really good
*finger print reader is fast but face unlock messes up sometimes
*dolby atmos sound on headset is really good
* good for gaming I'm getting high recommendation settings for most demand games
*camera is average but slow motion recordings is awesome ....front camera better than back one
*design is really good with the vibrant color
*call quality is above average, speaker sound is normal what you see in most smartphones but disordertion in high volumes
* I accidentally dropped it when taking a selfie,I'm tall so height was a bit high still phone survived with no scratches so good screen and back protection
*ui is user friendly

Cons
Battery is bad,6000mah doesn't meet expectations if I don't use phone much and just use internet rarely it last 14-16hr
On continuous usage just streaking watch vids and low end games it lasts only 8hrs continuously so really disappointed...
Charging slow why 15w charger on high battery phone
Face unlock sometimes slow

Delivery on time &amp; mobile also good but finger print sensor is on back site while it should be on front side due to amoled display.

I compared its camera with MI note 7 pro &amp; most of the modes are same but in few modes Mi camera is slightly better while both rear camera's are same .

Battery is not draining in a single day even entire day internet is ON due to office applications authentication but actually I use internet only 4-5 hours a day.

so summary is Mobile purchasing is worthy on Amazone &amp; Flipkart only in sale otherwise cost could be higher upto 5 to 6K...

Using Since Oct 12 2019,
First Impression:
Very premium looks (I took Pearl White), the best display ,the display is really very very good. Smooth back surface and light weight (even 6000mah).
Overall Details :-
1.Monstrous battery - used for a complete day and around 40%left at the end of the day , Every day i see youtube for 2-3hrs, some simulation games, net is on 24/7 and i do around 50-60 calls a day. It's taking around 2.5hrs for full charge from 0 - 100%.

2. Decent Processor : Especially in this price range we're getting really very good Processor, smooth for normal use and for games like pubg yes it'll work but not that much effective.

3.Camera : Camera is not up to mark, it's taking a bit time for capturing Especially in 48mp mode. Clarity is good ,but lots of bugs . If bugs are fixed ,then we can enjoy to the mark

4.Network : Wifi band is very good and Network signal is not showing full even at the best network available area. Signal stability is poor. Still speed is good.

5. Other features: It has lots of more features to be discovered
NOTE : OTG will work only if your pendrive is under FAT32 format.

Overall it's very good deal, especially for the brand value and trust on the brand and a bag full of features at a decent price.
Only small bugs in camera and some network issues , can be fixed by some updates.

Phone frame is a bit loose!!!

Like if you found helpful.

I bought this phone couple of months ago, I didn't like the for couple of reasons,  there is lag on the phone when you switch between the app, the seems to be slow compare other phone with the same spec, battery is horrible I won't even get full day charging... camera is also very bad only good thing about this phone screen resolution apart I am disappointed with all other features and performance... I would not recommend to buy this phone. For 10k you can a better phone... this is my honest comment.

Camera is not good at all so I wanted to write a review  on this mobile Samsung m30s but the Amazon customer care was locked to write  review  on this mobile  because  there was bigg billion  sale going on. These people are cheating and I can not return this mobile because of there is no problem with this mobile there are telling. Camera quality is provided based on the mobile price they are telling.

I have been using this handset for over a month now and here is my feedback
Pros:
1. Display 9/10
2. Battery 10/10 (easily last for 2 days). Please refer the image
3. Limited bloatware
4. No heating issue
5. Good front camera
6. Light weight (considering the 6000 mah battery)
7. Gaming not an issue
8. Power saver mode a very useful feature
Cons :
1. Back Camera quality is way too bad specially in Night and low light. Need to be fixed by Samsung with an update
2. Poly carbonate body is not scratch resistance. You better get a back cover
3. No screen protection in terms of Gorilla Glass. A tempered glass is a must

Overall a good budget phone

A brief review on the product after a month of usage .

In a word , A good phone that could be better.  The phone has several good features and one of the best phones from Samsung that could compete with the other rising smart phone competitors . However the phone has one major improvement that is required to sustain the competitive advantage.

Display : Clear , crisp , smooth,  great color reproduction . A good size and pleasant on the eyes . Value for money.  Scores a 5 out of 5.

UI :UI is smooth and nice . However I noticed that sometimes there is a lag which is visible and the phone seems to struggle when multiple applications run on the background.  This is something crucial to note because the phone is not yet loaded with multiple apps and has generous amount of storage space available. This can become a concern as the phone can become outdated quite easily as long as there are patched and updates that can keep the phone efficient. 4 out of 5

Form factor and feel , The phone feels light and easier to hold and access. Once you get the hang of it.  It is easier to use.  A 5 on this .

Camera : The shots taken at outdoors were a visual delight.  The wide angle lens is indeed making a mark whilst used in natural photography . However , The photos take a longer time to store and save once taken . The lag is quite evident and if you are someone who wants to take multiple shots in quick succession , You would be disappointed with the speed at which the camera would react and you might even miss the moment that you would wish to capture . So , despite the quality output that it might give . It may not be an ideal companion for shutterbugs . 4 out of 5 for quality of pictures. 2 out of 5 the responsiveness .

Battery : One of the most flaunted aspect of the phone is the battery. From the past one month of usage. I feel this is the biggest let down despite the tall claims on the 6000mAh. My previous MI Max 2 have been my companion for the past 2 years where the phone can last long on a usage of GPS for 3 hours with the bluetooth connected to the car with YouTube and mobile data and the rest of day with frequent use for calls and data and I could run without plugging the charger for a min of 2 days . With M30S , 6000mAH .I am disappointed to say that the phone cannot even match what the 5000mAH MI Max 2 could do.
The phone drains quite fast and especially if you are someone who would use multiple features you might as well run out of juice quite fast . For me this was important because,  I hate plugging my phone on socket on a daily basis for 2 hours for a mere less than 24 hours usage and my expectations were high due to the advertised Monstrous battery . Unless Samsung optimised the battery with some patch or upgrade .this is q huge let down . 2 out of 5 for the poor battery that does not live upto expectations.

Overall a nice phone with below average battery despite its tall claims.

Overall the phone is better than anyone with such specifications in this price range. Camera, sound and picture quality is superb. Nothing to worry about it's performance as Samsung is proving very good processor with its products. Smooth functioning and easy to operate. If u are already using samsung mobile phone , U'll definitely love it and if u r not using samsung mobile phone,  try it.

Flagship killer?? With the cost it definitely is the best in this segment.
To start with,  unboxing is easy.  Comes with preloaded 50% battery, which itself went for a day.
I put my old sim and it recognized easily.
The fingerprint sensor is better than Chinese mobiles in this range.
Face recognition is decent too. Not apple like though.
Battery: mammoth battery, goes for two days straight with full time 4G use and multiple calls. Though charging it takes more than 2 hours even with a fast charger from less than 10% to 100.
Canberra: mind blowing. The depth effect isn't the same as flagships but for the price, it IS the best.
Processor: ran multiple apps in there background on wifi and then played a couple of games. Pubg including.  Fantastic. There is some issues with the phoning hearing up though.

Super Amoled Display is awesome. 6/5
Sound is superb. 5/5
Battery is marathon 6/5
Camera Quality 4/5

UI is great. Night mode is wonderful. Always on display is my favourite.
My phone is white. I find this simple white colour classy than the competition using shining stickers. It has a class to it and will only appeal to classy people.
In the above aspects phone is far ahead of its competition.
Camera is not the best compared to competition 4/5. I am waiting for Samsung to fix it using software optimization soon, especially the front camera.
I haven't played any games yet. So can't comment on performance. Enjoying my durga puja right now with my new phone.
This is simply the best phone at this price. I really hope samsung improves the camera. I would be over the world then.

I am yung this phone for last shree moths. Deliberately took time to write. I don't use all functions like fingerprint lock etc. Also I don't download and keep too much apps in phone. My main use is of email and whatsapp/facebook. The battery is lasting for 40 hours with optimum use. With heavy use it lasts for 30 hours approximately.
I received a charger which do not mention of 15W Power. It takes more tha. 180 minutes for complete charging the phone. Slow charging. I selected this phone for 6000mAh battery and fast charging 15W charger. But seems to be received wrong charger.
Rest, the in built call record function is good.

The best thing about this phone is battery. It will last you for 1.5days normally. The display is amoled which is fantastic. You get android 10 update and will surely recieve Android 11 in the future. Dual sim + SD card slot all seperate which is a great conviniance. 6 gb of ram is good enough to get through any situation. Charging takes a but longer as it has a massive battery but 15W charger is not enough to charge the battery fast enough in this fast paced world. 30 W and it would have been perfect. Camera is great but don't expect DSLR quality pictures. It has 48mp, 8mp ultra wide and 5mp depth sensor which gives you good quality of pictures. 16 MP front camera in a year drop is also good enough for your daily task. It doesn't have conventional Snapdragon chipset but rather Samsung's inhouse exynos chip which is downside but there are no glitches whatsoever. It also comes with type c port so there is no hassle. The body is plastic and you'll need a good cover for the phone. The fingerprint sensor is rear mounted and it's fast. There is also face unlock feature. Software, the one ui is clean and easy to use. There are some preloaded app from Samsung which you can easily uninstall except the my galaxy app which you can disable so there is no issue of nonsense adds. This is after 4 months of use.

Everyone knows the Pros, so now I have to share some Cons.

1. Face unlock: totally dumb, its fast, but can be unlock with closed eyes and it dont work against low light.

2. Sound quality: Sound not so much loud, Samsung should improve this.

3. Camera: 48MP!!! But noises seen after zooming and no beauty mode in selfie cam...

4. Backcover missing: At least TPU back cover should be added inside of the box, cause backside plastic is too much thin and finger print magnet.

5. Screen Protection: Now its time for Gorilla glass protection. But the most essential thing is missing, screen is amoled, costly to repair, it should be protected well.

Lets try to rate the claimed and unclaimed #GoMonster features:-
1. Battery (min.5830mAh- max6000mAh)...5/5 (stays longer than u wd expect but yes DEPENDENT  on your usage)
2. Super AMOLED ... 5/5 (a display u can flaunt to ur peers... truly a MONSTER)
3. Performance 'Exynos 9611'...5/5... Lag free till now... Satisfactory  experience in simple tasks...(though am not a gamer)
4. Camera... NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT... I FOUND THE FRONT CAMERA SIMPLY  AWESOME  MUCH CONTRARY TO OTHER REVIEWS  (MAY BE AFTER THE FIRST OTA UPDATE)... BUT U WD SIMPLY LOVE IT... AND YES THE REAR CAMERA JUSTIFIES THE CLAIMED #MONSTER PICTURE QUALITY... IN 48MP ( PHOTO MODE... 3:4 RATIO)
5. Now THE UNCLAIMED / NOT THAT HYPED FEATURES...BUT U 'LL LOVE IT
--&gt; ONE UI... SIMPLY  AWESOME... (I HAVE USED MIUI AND MOTOROLA DEVICES BEFORE)
--&gt; THE SMART THINGS AND SMART VIEW FEATURES ARE VERY SIMPLE AND LOVED THE BUTTERY EXPERIENCE  FOR CASTING  AND SCREEN MIRRORING
--&gt; THE LOCK SCREEN / WALLPAPERS AND THEMES FROM GALAXY STORE... ARE ALSO GOOD ACTUALLY  VISUAL TREAT FOR ENJOYING THE SUPER AMOLED SCREEN CAPABILITIES...
--&gt; DEDICATED  MICRO SD CARD SLOT/ 3.5MM JACK AND USB TYPE C PORT CHARGING/ OTG SUPPORT WITH UFS 2.1 ...ARE ALSO NICE!!!
--&gt; THE DIALER APP HAS DIRECT VIDEO CALL BUTTON...IS THE LAST FEATURE  BUT NOT THE LEAST... STILL MANY TO EXPLORE!!!
So, from my side A MUST  BUY FOR ANYONE  LOOKING  FOR A BELOW 20K SMARTPHONE AT PRESENT  SCENARIO!!!

Mine variant was 4gb/32gb brought it at 11500 after Amazon cash back and bank offer.
Firstly camera is avg. Do not expect quality like redmi or realme phones. Autofocus hunts for focus all the time. But AI mode do better job in recognising scene although it is quit slow but never mind.
OneUI is damn slow even browsing apps in setting can show sluggishness. Try opening multiple apps and u will experience.
Battery life is definitely a plus point no doubt about that. It easily provides back up for 2 days for normal use and 1.5 day for heavy usage.
For budget range of 12k i will certainly recommend but for photography enthusiast can choose redmi 7/8 pro or realme or latest Motorola macro one

This is best suitable for day to day activities like browsing,gaming,watching movies and taking selfies,etc Battery life is excellent no comment on this. Stylish design and light weight... But I couldn't experienced a good quality shot as mentioned in the specifications. It never ever produced a picture quality of 48.MP camera. But camera clarity is not bad it can produce comparatively better picture in this price range. Selfie camera is good. Overall it is a good package for gamers and ladies.

I bought the Phone in November and writing the review in may, so it's almost 6 months now and right time to share feedback and observations of Samsung Galaxy M30 6+128GB 6000mah battery phone.
Okay, so far my usage
1.I have used it for duo and Whatsap video calling on an average of 30mins a day.
2. Game once in a while for 2 hours monthly.
3. Normal calls and SMS average 30mins a day.
4. Camera usage for videos and photos for 30mins a day. Yes I have captured more than 1.5lacs pics + videos from this Phone.
5. video playback and online streaming 1hr per day.
6. Data network swapping from SIM 1 to SIM 2.
7. 90% of the time connected to Wifi.
8. Average download of videos data 30mins a day with high speed Wifi or 4G.

Observations :
- Charging time from 0 to 100 ~ 3 hours . And lasts for one full day with 10 to 20% Battery left by end of the day.
- Camera quality has reduced as it can be noticed in the pics and videos captured in beginning and now.
- Even Battery life is bit reduced compared to earlier but it's not worst though.
- now a days display gets heated up for 5 mins video call on 4G data but looks fine over Wifi.
- haven't seen application or Phone hanging so far.

Over all rating is 3 off 5 and it's good rating after 6 months of usage when compared to my old redmi Phone which had to be charged for 2 to 3 times in a day for my usage.

i had heard lot of negatives about exynos processor, was skeptical while buying, but lot of other features attracted me, and moreover Samsung " a make in India product" and to some extent being a non-Chinese product added points to my selection.
i am a not a gamer, but for my usage with lots of calls, whatsapp, maps, and with gps running, bluetooth connected, all these has not drained the battery.
and no delays in app change-over, inspite of lot of screens open in background.
so i rate it excellent.
this phone has little curvature at the ends, adds on to its looks. camera is excellent, so its great.

Super Amoled Screen,
6000 mAh battery (Beast in category),
Samsung Branding,
Very good processor,
Comparatively lighter than any other mobile in this segment,
Unibody sturdy as well dual tone design,
Very quick face unlock,
Unmatched camera experience even if we compare its secondary 48 mp camera with 64 mp camera of other mobiles.

And many more...

There are many reasons to buy it but hardly any to refuse temapation to buy it.

Go for it brothers and sisters...

Phones have become all time companions of people and are aspiring to become all in one gadgets. With their ever expanding list of abilities and refinements, we, quite understandably, have started taking the basics for granted - like the ability of a phone to make and receieve calls and that is exactly what Samsung Galaxy M30s fails to deliver. I can go gaga over its battery life or have a wise critical debate on its camera quality over the price point, but all in vein. Its a beautiful handheld device which is just not intended to make or receive phone calls.

From a user experience perspective, while speaking over M30s, in almost every single phone call, there are pockets of few seconds where you cannot hear the person at the other end. These quiet pockets usually occur multiple times even in a short call (2 to 3 minutes) and can span a across 3 to 10 seconds, occassionally leading to call drops or more frequently, the person on the other end cutting the call realising something must have gone wrong with network. Also, if you go slightly outskirts of the city with marginally poor signal strength in the area, M30s does not pick up any signal at all, even when other phones show three to four bars.

From a technical perspective, in proper city area, where signal strength is excellent and phones show 5 bars, M30s show 2 to 4 bars, flactuating among these. I tried with 3 different SIM cards from 3 different providers - Airtel Vodafone and JIO in the same location (My living room!) on M30s and two older android phones of same segment - one from ASUS and another from Lenovo and found that for all three SIM cards, M30s' signal receptions were weakest (Airtel: Around -100 dBm Vodafone: Around -110 dBm JIO: Around -96 dBm), while the other two older phones give full 5 bar signals and the signal strengths are far higher.

Just to add, if you ditch LTE and connect the SIM to 3G/2G mode in M30s, the signal strength jumps to normal and at par with the other two phones connected to 4G LTE mode. Of course you cannot afford to keep doing that with the Internet connected to a painstakingly slow EDGE network.

I can indeed see quite a few people commenting on the issue, but most of the people have mentioned about the usual stuffs like camera or fingerprint reader or the screen. I wonder if they have not really faced the problem or are completely oblivious to the fact that their phones cannot make or take phone calls properly! In case of the earlier, I still may have a chance that the replacement phone (Once I ask for the replacement and the seller agrees, of course) would work. However, if its an inherent hardware manufacturing issue, I may have to escalate it through consumer forum and other legal procedures.

Phone camera takes too noisy pictures not at all impressive with 48 megapixel camera, the wide angle also has an issue the pictures on top corners go wierd can even check my upload low segment phones are better than this.

Battery life is ok, but the Super Amoled screen display is not all going to survive even a 3 feet fall and may go blank &amp; even gets cracks upon falling from heights.... !

Finger print is very responsive

Plastic body feels like a low segment phone in hands doesn't look premium.

Phone overall looks good ,wide screen...
camera quality is good for that price range. Face scan is plus for this range of phone.. finger print is good but It takes 4-5 seconds to unlock.
Camera options are pretty satisfying SLO-MO , ultra wide angle shot are impressing.
I’m happy with the colour I chose which is opal black.  The Live wallpaper/ Dynamic wallpaper  for lock screen Concept is amazing.
Battery life is very good.. comes for 3 days with medium usage. The phone battery is optimised, which is a very good feature.
Overall a good phone with that price.
This has many of the iPhone features.

NOTE: This phone box doesn’t include earphones and back case unlike A50 or anything other.

The product doesn't provide for any screen recorder or convert to PDF options (WP office can be downloaded on play store) which is the only plus point in Redmi Note 7 pro...so a request to provide for these options to Samsung in their future updates

Please think of wannabe Youtubers also

rest all the features including camera are excellent and outdo any of its competitor in the market....Gamers are going to enjoy the 6000 mAh battery 🔋

All the best for ur future endeavours 👍

It's a worst product...I have got it on Sunday October 6, 2019 and today I.e. october 9, 2019, battery has swollen and phone has opened from one side...not expected this kind of product from Samsung .

October 16, 2019 -  I am disappointed from your service level . I receive a call from Mr. Abhinav  on October 12, 2019 for replacement of the faulty phone. I had already handed over the phone to Samsung service centre for change of battery . As per his saying that Amazon is going to replace the phone, I got the phone back from Service Centre . On Monday, technician was assigned to check the phone .Technician came on MOnday and took the photographs and told that phone would replaced soon. Even Mr. Abhinav also said that phone would be replaced with 48 hours after visit of technician . Now Mr.Abhinav is not contacting any more and I spoke to Mr.Satyabrata . He is saying that replacement is not possible and refund would be done . Also, he says that I can order the same phone again . My question is  -  WHY IT WAS NOT CONVEYED IN FIRST INSTANCE ONLY THAT REPALCEMENT  IS NOT POSSIBLE ?  IF I CAN ORDER THE SAME MODEL AGAIN, THEN WHY REPLACEMENT IS NOT POSSIBLE ?  WHO IS GOING TO BEAR THE LOSS OF MY TIME/ FUEL TO GET BACK THE PHONE,  MONEY SPENT ON PHONE FOR SCREEN GUARD AND COVER AND ALSO THE INTEREST CHARGES ON  MY CARD ?

This is not a good service/ resolution provided by Amazon where all decisions are taken by the company and making a fool of customer .  If Aamzon is having a tie up with samsung, then it is your responsibilty to arrange a replacement of phone.

I am not at all interested in refund of money and want a replacement of phone . If you cannot arrange the black colour phone, I am fine with the blue one also with same configuration .

Hoping for a positive solution .

Mobile is very good. Weight distribution is perfect, so dont feel heavy in hand (but you can feel the wt. when mobile is in pocket). Battery with single sim is monstor, but with 2 volte sims much high. But 6000mah is more than sufficient. Charging is very quick. Photos good but there is scope for update. Signal strength slightly lower to chinese phones (but samsung phones are safer with low radiation).. screen too qualty, processor is also very good.BEST THING IS ONE UI, IT IS LIKE STOCK ANDROID. You can uninstall more app and even hide app which gives a absolutely clean look drawer.

Wish I had 10 stars rating for the battery back up &amp; the value for money proposition it gives with it's all new 9611 processor...
I'm happy to see Samsung fighting it out roughly with Chinese vendors and giving them a taste of their own medicine...
Go for it blindly if your seeking best camera best processor and the best battery life phone below 15k

Superb product. Totally happy with it. Bought it on Great Indian Sale and got cashback as well as instant discount. Its main attraction is its monsterous battery. It will last for 1 and a half day for mediam usages but for heavu usage it should last a day (12 to 14 hours). Camera quality is preety good. And the display is also very bright as well as colourful. Totally satisfied with it.
But it has some drawbacks as well, its fingerprint sensor is fast but not as fast as other phones in recent times. I should say its 3 out of 5. Another thing is its front camera. It is little bit soft as compare to its megapixels. It also struggle in low light conditions. Another important security drawback is that it didn't provide any private mode or private space for personal pictures and files. Although Samsung provides it on its other divices like A series phones but not in vase of  budget phones. Its an issue who have used it earlier. But samsung can easily fix it with an ota update.
Overall its a worth buying phone. You can go with it without any hesitations. I think 4+64 GB is worth buying option than 6+128. Both of them are same except the storage. I think the higher varient is rs. 1000 overpriced as compare to 4,64 gb varient.

I purchased this mobile because 6000MAH battery so don't need to buy power bank. First time use I charged 100% and tested. Unfortunately this mobile battery life is not  even 24 hours. I follow up my 30 customers around 2 hours.Updated Samsung software around 1 hour.I put sleep mode Samsung notified apps like whatsapp and uninstalled virus programs like movies,games,Ads which  don't  need middle class and poor people. That's all i used. I found out battery life is 20 hours for one time full charge. I will test again one more time after one month.Let see.

Nice promotion but difference between official paper specification with actual product.

Cons.
1. 48 Mega pixel camera is not upto the mark for still photography. Quality wise it is max 16MP.
2. 4GB RAM..... But it's system occupying more than 2 GB.
3. Photo quality seems very good while you see those in this phone but in computer it is really not good enough comparing with other same or low budget Samsung mobile.

Pros.
1. Nice look
2. Reasonable price.
3. Slow motion and Super Slow motion video recording.
4. 6000mHA battery.

At last, M30S it not good enough to consider for photography.

Battery: 10/10! After playing PUBG ( Smooth+Extreme FPS) For 2 Hrs , the battery came to 96% from 100%!
Camera: 9/10 The camera is actually better than the competition, Dont believe any youtuber about what they say bad for its camera!
Performance: Fluid User Interface, No stutters, Pubg at SMOOTH+EXTREME AND HDR+ULTRA
Design: A compromise but Acceptable!
Biometrics: Fingerprint sensor is Fast!
Face Unlock is not much Responsive as you get better response on Realme,Oppo and Vivo!
Overall the phone will satisfy you!

Trust me!! this is the best phone to buy in the market screen sharpness, super amoled display, battery, camera, style, all score a perfect 10. After using this for more than 2 weeks now I still cant find a constraint to mention here. I have been an iphone user for last 8 years and this is a refreshing change to android samsung device.
Battery can last easily 1.5 day
Nobody believes I paid only13k for a beautiful phone like this.
Big thanks to Amazon for perfect delivery

Those who are saying Camera is worst, why U didn't go with higher budget phone.
According to me a brand like Samsung providing all these amazing specs in this price range is great.

Display is beast, one ui with all those unique features is great. Super slow motion video os wonderful. Battery is pretty good. No heating issue, either while charging or using. And many more good things.

U can't expect DSLR like camera in a 14k phone. Everything running smooth and fine and according to my exception. It will never dissapoint in normal usage conditions.

One thing that feels little bit dissapointing is though it has 6000mah battery, it does feel like 5000mah in actual.

I got the phone(4+64) in 11,600 effective price(14000 - 1400 instant cashback - 1000 amazon pay balance), and I m really ammused to have this. Thank you Amazon and Samsung.

I lost my money and patience due to this phone with 6 GB RAM . I bought this phone with very high expectations, but camera was taking forever to save image captured through 48 MP. Also while sending those images it took somuch time that my old phone was faster than this... I took the same to Authorised service center where I was informed that the problem lies with all the handsets of this series i.eM30S. Totally disappointed. Camera quality is good but processing/saving time killed enthusiasm to click. Had to sell handset in second hand market with great loss.

Kudos to Amazon for the fast delivery. Got this phone in less than 24 hours. So I'm writing this review after 5 days of full heavy usage and I must say I'm impressed by what Samsung is doing to capture the sub ₹15000 market.

Displays is crisp and accurate colours are shwon because of amoled. Brightness get way too high when you fully enable it. No problem in outdoor reading.

Battery is really outstanding 2 days full heavy use and was left with 4% at the end of the day with YouTube Netflix streaming at full had with 70% brightness calls call of duty game listening songs etc with keep in mind my 4G always being on with volte.

Call quality is really good. But if there's a network issue in your area then there's nothing you can do.

Camera quality is great. When we click on 48 mp pro mode. Colours stand out. In portrait mode edge detection is also good. In the front facing dept I honestly think Samsung needs to work on getting the image crisp rather than a soft touch even after disabling the beauty mode. There's still a soft touch. Can't say because my note 9 and s10 does have this problem too. Ultra wide camera is also good but keep in mind it captures photo in a lil bit of fish eye's view.

Sound via headphone jack is like 8/10 Dolby Atmos works great but it could be further extended via an ota update in future just like the m20 has way too option to customise the Dolby Atmos setting like whether you want more instrument or more treble or bass. Sound via speaker is 7.5/10 could be a lil bit more louder compared to other phones in this price segment.

Weight distribution is really good. Doesn't feel heavy at all.

Samsung has really improved in the fingerprint and face unlock dept. It's now way to fast but a mere 0.20-0.30 delay because of typical  Samsung animation but it's fast. Face unlock is now accurate and fast but don't think like one plus level face unlock.

One UI has been really optimised by Samsung. No lags and all. No ads and all like miui or colour os. Just keep in mind when you set up your phone make sure to disable the market promotion both in galaxy store and in the wallpaper settings. Got the phone and already had a August patch update.

I got the 4/64 gB variant and sapphire blue colour for 11600. And I must say I'm really impressed. Great job! If you get the phone for this price. Just go for it without even thinking to buy any other phone.

The overall experience with this handset is very good. OS has very good features in terms of security and other features like themes.

Battery like is very good, getting almost for 2 days for my usage. And the fast charge is very good.

Though there are few cons also.
1. Speaker is little less powerful, but indoors it is managble.
2. Camera output is not very satisfying, though it claims 48MP.  Main reason is colors are unnatural.

Edit:
After two months of usage,
Overall performance of the phone is good, not very satisfied with camera quality.
Also, Google maps is not accurate. Response is slow (both mobile phones using same network) compared to other model mobile phone.

Thanks

I bought the phone through prime sale with one day delivery. When I got the phone the next day, I could see that the backside of the phone which was plastic, has been damaged. I immediately returned the product. Beware guys, the phone's build is really poor. Hardware is moderate but quality of body is really worse.

M30s is a game changer for samsung in mid range smartphone category. Unfortunatelý i received a defected product. but i am highly satisfied with the performance, especially samsung one UI interface.👍👍👍😊😊

After 2 weeks using this phone, i reduced my rating by one star only because of plastic body back.
Here is pro &amp; cons for this latest samsung brand new m series smartphone.
Pro -
1. Overall device performance is good. Battery back up, gaming performance, camera quality is really amazing.
2. Samsung one UI is really awsome. It gives premium experiance when you use this device. Hope new update One UI 2 will be pushed to this device also.

Cons -
1. Plastic body is the major isssue with this device. Side panels produces click sound when you hold device. And major issue with plasti body is , it can easily get scratch mark and finger marks on the back of device.
2. Low light image quality is not upto the mark if campared the other devices in this price segment. Other wise day light images are preety good and amazing.

Hope it will help customers who want to purchase this device.

2. Camera Quality is very good.
3. Battery Life is like Mammoth.
4. Superb Touch Screen.
5. Fingerprint sensor working very good.
6. Stable Android 9 "Pie" OS (box pack), now upgraded to Android 10 "Q".

Many thanks to amazon for producing this product at this price.In fact no words for amazon for presenting great india festival offer. In this purchase I have got 10% instant discount on sbi card, Rs.1000 cash back in amazon wallet and 1yr screen replacement guarentee of Rs.6000/-...what else we can expect from amazon😉...

As far as this mobile is concerned, i think this is the best mobile at this price in recent market.camera is awesome. live focus and wide angel effect is mindblowing, lots of options in camera. Compared to vivo, mi, oppo, this is the best camera i believe...few photos are given here. Battery life is huge, 1n hlf days in normal use.
Phone itself is very fast. Highly recommended and u can buy it without any doubt.

A massive battery easily ensures two and a half days of moderate usage. The camera gives sharp pictures in good lighting conditions. In the dark, the night mode without flash gives artistic images with shadows. However, the camera takes a long time for the exposure and one needs to keep the phone absolutely still. If we use the flash, the images are relatively clear. The sAMOLED display is a delight and easy on the eyes - one of the hallmarks of this smartphone. The Dolby Atmos sound works with earphones / headphones but not with the speakers. The opal black colour is also something I liked.
However, a major irritant is that the Galaxy Store apps get downloaded even if I don't need them. I keep deleting those apps and they keep getting downloaded.

I have received on 1st Oct, after being used for 10 days I am writing my review with pros and cons. Which may useful to decide to buy or not

Pros:
1. Display amazing
2. Watched a movie with Dolby sound it's really awesome. So music experience also good
3. Sound (ring tone) audible
4.Battery is 6000 mah but not powerful as m30 of 5000 mah, but ok serve purpose of 1.5 day.
5. Powerful processor, so far didn't observe lags may be need to load apps. After that I can edit this review.
6. Both the sim slots support VOLTE, so one can use JIO sims on both.

Cons:
1. Signal receiving very bad. I have honor 7x, placing side by side. This is worst in signal reciving. Due to this call drop happen almost every time even if you stand right behind call tower. I don't know it can be fixed later with patch. I feel this most important factor for mobile purchase. If it doesn't serve very basic need then it is waste of money. Rating 3 star.
3. Lot of bloatware which user doesn't not need. Most of apps doesn't have permission to delete.

I think Samsung needs to improve on Primary Network issues

The basic functionality of the phone is to speak. Its heating near ear speaker after few minutes of call. Really its hearts and loosing concentration in my meetings.

This is one worst I felt..

Coming to camera quality..
It's not worth to 48 mp camera..
All pics are with blurr in room light condition.

Battery life..
I have my old Mi note 5 pro with 4000 Mah battery. I didn't  notice any difference in M30s with 6000 mah. But it's ok.

Don't  think that M30s is having 6000 mah worth battery.

Screen quality is awesome as obviously it is with samoled screen.

SAR value is less when compared  to other phones..
This is another good thing I noticed..

The main problem is device is heating for 10 minutes browsing and for 2 mins call.

I am requesting  SAMSUNG please release software update to optimize heating the phone..

Better I would suggest go for other brands unless you are looking for good screen..

Thanks..

I bought Galaxy m30s on first day first sale and I won't regret it, Its best phone in all aspects  so far,
1. The phone battery is really  monster, and it refuse to die. I am watching NETFLIX AND listen to spotify  it comes two days for me.
2. Camera quality is good and photos are coming great in day light  and night mode u have to switch on flash
3. Coming to sAmoled display  no one can make display like Sasung .
4. Ignore the negative reviews and get the phone. You won't regret it.

Screen - 5☆ should be 6"
Camera - 3☆ 3 cameras don't make sense if they still capture blurry pics in artificial lighting, yet for my mom's point of view they perform well compared with Galaxy Quattro.
Software - 5☆ top notch, gives what matters, no ads unlike MI
Battery - 5☆ tremendous
Build Quality - 3☆ could be stronger
Overall - 4.5 ☆ Go for it!

In one word, using the Samsung M30s for anything, taking pics, whatsapping, emailing whatever, this smartphone oozes just one thing - Quality. Quite simply, I have higher end phones too, but this one is simply unmatchable, and for me personally Samsung gladdened my heart to unmeasurable levels by wedding a superb 128 GB phone with a 6000 MAH battery. With the kind of usage I am having of the phone, its battery is lasting me anywhere between 4 to 7 days. I noticed that some apps have been loaded from the factory, of which after I delete several that I do not have any use for, I am sure this phone's battery will last me a good 8-10 days.

I have been using the phone for the last 15 days and what I have noticed is that the network speed and stability of the network are very bad compared to other branded phones I used before. Usually, the LTE speed and coverage inside my house and On the balcony are pretty stable but when I changed to M30S the network will shuffle between E and H+ and from time to time, it goes to LTE with the low signal (Normally 2 out of 4 bars). When i go through the customer review on Amazon i get to know that it's not an isolated incident. A lot of customers are facing the same problem.
This phone is working very slow with WIFI netwrk and connection is also not stable.
Cause of this issue is :- M30s is powered with  Exynos , snapdragon powered SOC's( 675,710,712) support LTE category-15 with a download speed of 800 Mbps whereas the Exynos has category-12 with a downloading speed of 600 Mbs. This is the cardinal reason for the low data speed and network issue.

Too much OVERHEATING whenever calling, using camera or charging. Upon complaining, Amazon cust.care instructed to install BLANCCO which shows your handset is ok(which is specially designed to reject customers replacement claims). You can verify this by BLANCCO's review on Playstore. Don't waste your money on this risky device, which may create serious problems due to overheating.
Camera quality is AVERAGE. Like 20mp. Pictures appear opaque.
Think twice before buying, don't go by the advertisement.

Camera: The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots. Additional zoom-out features for both front and rear camera is nice to have.

Battery: I am really happy with battery backup as it lasts up to approx 2 days. Yes, approx 48 hours with medium usage including WiFi and GPS.

Design, Touch, Look &amp; Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light.

The face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock. The processing speed is good enough for heavy games without much heating effect.
Camera 5/5

Hi All,
I am writing review after 3 weeks of usage.

Looks like great improvement over M30 in terms of device specifications. But only performance is good as it have newest processor  Exynos 9611, camera improvement is not good. It is still ok camera.

Fingerprint unlock is good and reliable, not faced any issues yet. But you can add only 3 finger prints, hoping if new updates can make it at least 5, that would be good.
Placement is little up than expected at the back, it should be at the level where name SAMSUNG is printed.
Also it would be really great if it can be on screen scanner in upcoming phones of this series as perice is around 18k INR.

6000 mAh battery is good but does not last full two days with low usage also. Lasts only for 1 to 1.5 days. For gamers and heavy users, it won't last full day also.
My daily usage is 1-2 hours of games, 1-2 hours on chrome app. WhatsApp not in active use, but go through it once or twice in an hour. Google music 1-2 hours per day, sometimes watching movies 2-3 hours over wifi only.
Opening camera apps only when needed.
I am not using google assistant also.
Hoping for more battery optimization in upcoming updates.

Screen touch is good and screen is bright as well for me 20 to 40% brightness is enough.
When compared to height to width ratio, I feel phone is long than my old phone. I feel it would be better is the width also little bit more. No issues yet with long phone other that it is difficult to fit in shirt pocket.
The adaptive brightness is very sensitive, faced few issues while gaming moving from one room to other, even in same room sometimes.

I am very disappointed with the rear camera 48 MP. Expecting good performance with Samsung brand as I have seen best cameras from this brand in budget phones below 15k prices. The pictures are not very sharp when compared with my older moto x play 21 MP camera. Also on HDR mode, it takes 2 -3 seconds post processing time. Also observed heating near fingerprint scanner and camera area after recording 10-15 min video recording or playing games for over 1 hour on my device, not feeling heat on screen as in my moto x play while playing online games like pubg or clash of clans.
Observed good size differences of image files in heic format vs nornal jpeg format.
Front camera is good for video calls. Used for 8 to 10 calls. Average 10 to 15 mins calls.
Expecting front flash on upcoming M series phones in 2020.

Earphone speakers are loud and clear, but speakers can be louder as well. Felling less powerful when listening to music on speakers.
Bottom side 3.5 mm jack is new for me, it will take some time for adjust to that.

Rear panel is good in color. Mine is opal black version, the back is black with some dark green shade. Little slippery on flat surfaces like table top, kitchen counters, tea table. Not seens any scratches after 2 weeks, but decided to go for phone cover to protect back. Still using screen without screen protector, no scratches yet. Same as my moto x play, but it has gorilla glass 3 protection.this has none. Hoping to buy a screen guard also.

Not feeling very comfortable with the samsung keyboard, will disable it and switch back to gboard or google indic keyboard.

Free RAM available is 2 -2.8 GB only out of 6 GB installed. Gameplay is smooth for now. I play PUBG on balance graphics and high frame rate. Average of 10-12% battery drain per hour, not played till phone switching off but expect to have 9 to 10 hours gameplay life with these results. I have only 20 other apps installed from google play store. Disabled the motion themes, switched to plain wallpapers. Power mode is always active. Blue screenfiler and night mode are on only from 8 pm to 8 am IST. Display brightness is between 20-40% always. Adaptive brightness is always on.
I do not use always on display feature.

Antutu benchmarks score is low as compared to same price range phone by other brands.
Mine is showing 119355. HTML5 Tests shows value of 23039. Not ran any other benchmark apps.

Software updates I think Samsung is as slow as Lenovo in this regard. I received phone with August 2019 security patch. Not received new security patches yet.

Overall phone is good choice if you are looking for a decent battery backup and performance with Samsung brand name.
Camera app/performance needs to be revised and updated to meet cuatomer expectations.

That's all for now. Will try to update my review after some more time.

Nice phone and I purchased it for my Dad, the price was INR 12,999 when i buyed it. Long battery life and will get charged soon. No issues of battery draining or touch/swipe till now. Camera is a bit disappointing apart from that everything is fine under this price. And am writing this review after a month. Satisfied. Can go for it.

I have been using iPhone for few years and have been Samsung person since I got my first smartphone. I used Galaxy Grand, S6, Z3, Jmax before moving to iPhone. I am glad to come back to Samsung and the phone is outstanding. Touch is awesome, battery is powerful and camera is excellent at this price point. I don't see any reason to spend huge money on high end phone since we get everything in M30s. I have been advising my friends and colleagues to go for it if they want to switch.indact a friend already purchased and is a happy owner of M30s. Samsung has picked up again with innovative products at competitive price.....way to go for Samsung. Love you

This is very good phone for day to day use.

Camera- 9/10
Battery- 10/10
Display- 6/10 (colors are not as earlier super amoled- needs improvement)
Ram &amp; processor- 9/10
Hardware quality- 4/10 (needs a lot improvement in build quality, specially back cover, sim tray is not properly setting when SD card is inserted, build design issue)

Overall a descent package.

Samsung m30s is the best mid range phone i have been using. The fingerprint scanner is also really fast though you there is face detection which is way more faster. The 6gb and128gb variant is a giant device, which does not fills so easily. Last but not the least it has a beast of a battery which is 6000mah, this lasts upto 2 days in normal usage. Battery life is very good. As for the camera quality i have posted a picture taken from this phone without any gimble. I have recommended this device to many of my friends and will also recomment everyone looking to buy a mid range phone.

Best midrange mobile ever I have used. Far better than Realme and Redmi phones.
Display is better than anyone else even a flagship can't deliver such quality.
Camera is good and I haven't used much .
Battery which is its main highlight, its beast and no comparison which other in terms of battery and display.

The fingerprint reader does not stores the whole finger in its memory but only certain parts. Hence, the phone will unlock only when that part of finger is sensed by the sensor. My 4 years old Huawei P9 is way ahead than this. Face unlock is not disappointing but not even impressive, just satisfying. Camera is good in this range, if you expect more then you will have to shell out more. Battery is excellent, it goes 28-30 hours without charge in moderate usage. Screen is awesome and touch response it amazing.

After using it more than 2 months following points are there in my PERSONAL VIEW. Lets divide it in pros and cons.

PROS:

1) Rear Camera quality is superb. Even wide angle lens keeps proper depth of the photo. Remarkable.

2) Super Amoled display is marvellous. From any corner it gives proper color..

3) ONE UI is best in the market after stock Android. Far better than MIUI, Color OS etc.

4) Face unlock is pretty fast.

5) Superb weight distribution.

CONS:

1) The most hyped battery. It does not seem like 6000mah. Hardly like 4500-6000. After fully charged, on a moderate use it runs around 1 day or maximum 1.5 day. ( Moderate usage means, taking calls, sms, social sites, around 1 hr video streaming and on always on 4G network. I STRICTLY AM NOT A GAMER.)

2) Fingerprint sensor is slow compared to other phones available in market.

3) Polycarbonate back can get you scratch if you don't use TPU cases.

4) Most third class front camera. Make every photo whitish. Depth is completely missing in normal mode. But in portrait, it works slightly better.

And one thing to mention, I purchased this one after watching lot reviews in YouTube. I would suggest, don't trust reviewers in terms of batter back up. SAMSUNG HAS THE WORST BATTERY OPTIMIZATION.

But overall it's a decent one in 17k since I find nothing in purchasing any of the cinese branded phones investing this much money.

Cheers to all.

Superb monster future to make every customer fool. Also great amazing team for customer care. They only request 5 star for their communication with us. Otherwise they don't do anything about replacement of item or any other problems persist on your phone. "All problems inside the phone" this tag lines suitable for this. Also one amazing app is there for these problems that's "blancco". Superb app. This app it's self hanging, then it check the phone is correct or not. Wow. Camera is not a look like 48mp it's just like VGA camera. Very poor quality. Fast charging takes almost 5 hrs to 83% charging. Better stop this product.

WORST EVER PRODUCT IN SMART PHONES. THE GLASS DISPLAY DID NOT EVEN LASTED AN HOUR ..WHEN SLIPPED FROM JUST MEAGRE HALF A FEET IT BROKE. WORST MORE THING IS SAMSUNG ASKED 7400 RUPEES FOR DISPLAY IN A.S.RAO NAGAR SERVICE CENTRE. IF GLASS COSTS 5000 RUPEES THEN WHAT THE HELL OUT OF 14000 RUPEES THE REST OF THE PHONE GOES? SAMSUNG SHOULD EITHER TOUGHEST UNBREAKABLE GLASS DISPLAY OF REPLACEMENT CHEAPTER. IN MY LIFE TIME I WILL NEVER AGAIN BUY SAMSUNG  PHONES. THAT IS FOR SURE. 100% WORST PHONE.

I purchase this phone on 29 sept.i tell u some important features of this phone.
About camera.the camera of the phone is awesome lots of new option available in this product like super slow motion video capturing,beautiful emojis option,zooming facility,night mode everything was perfect.
Battery life. Its a jumbo battery life.you are using continuously 12 hours without any heating problem.phone was fully charged in 2.30 hours.
Finger print was awesome within a second phone was unlock.
Data speed was also good .
Super  amoled display gives you the best video quality.
A dolby atom sound option available.
But the company  can't give any head phone and any screen protection with this device.
Also the flash light colour was not so good.
Overall in this price this phone was awesome full value of money.

The best bit about the phone is that it neatly packs in a battery with some serious juice to last upto a day and a half and more with a single charge and while running quite a few applications for a few hours. Have experienced negligible lag in performance and operability. Audio output through phone speakers is decent. Audio quality and sound through earphones is good but can be better. Display is quite big but it doesn't feel big when you hold it. Very easy to transfer data from your old Galaxy phone to this one with the help of smart switch. Camera picture quality for daylight is decent however I'm not too sure about night mode as the picture quality is often grainy.

Absolute Value for money phone if you are looking for one that has a very long battery life with pretty decent specs.

Only downside is Samsung is not offering any option to upgrade to any paid storage plans for its Samsung cloud service. The phone or your Samsung account will come with a preset basic plan of 15 GB of cloud storage.

After using 8 days of M30S,I am writing  this review.
Pros
------
 1.Processor speed:
--------------------
If you  previously using Samsung then you know thay how mush slow was Samsung  mobile phone aftre using 6 months.
But in the last few years they improved.They using their own processor Exynos. And after google search I found that Exynos 9611 processor is good.

2.UI(User Interface):
-----------------------
Previously I am using Moto. They provided good user interface.Due to friend circle I was refred many othe company phone.But these phone user interface is not suitable for me.I already known Samsung also provide good interface.But I surprices when I open M30s.What a look of the theme,specialy Icon!!!! Amazing.I am big fan of dark mode.They also provide dark mode.It's amazing,look gorgeous.

3.Audio Quality:
-------------------
They provide Dolby Atmos sound.Which is also provide good sound quality.The sound is clear even when sound was full.

4.Battery:
-----------
They provide 6000 mAh huge bettey. This is also an advantage for a smartphone user.
After full charge,I was uses my mobile around 2 days(First charging),
then I was uses my mobile arond 30Hrs(2nd Charging),
then I was uees my mobile around 30Hrs(3rd charging).
I think if you using soo much your mobile then they lasting around 1 days.

5.Camera:
------------
I think under 15k they provide best camera.Because if you look any others company,they provide 64MP/48MP camera.But if you compare with m30s, m30s far far better than others company's camera.
And specaily I like Samsung camera beacuse I like those photo which are not using filter means they provide original photo and they provide it.If you using filter,you can use it,they provide this option seperatly.

Pros:
------
1.Camera:
-----------
Previously I told you the camera is best,that's right.
But in the my opinion they does not provide 48MP camera(like any other company).They just advertisement of there product's camera.
But in the prospect of money and other company's camera,m30s camere is far better.
2.Bettery:
------------
They advertisement they provide 6000mAh bettery,whis is longer 2 days,after heavy using.
But that's not true.Previously I told you,if you using heavy task playing PUBG,playing game or watching video,it is long around 24 hrs.please samsung stop this advertisement.

3.Weight:
-----------
The mobile weight is 186 gm.Which is a little bit of weight of a smartphone.

4.Interface:
-------------
Point of my view,the flash position is not at all correct.If the flash is arranged after 3 cameras,then that's a perfect arrangement for a smartphone.

If you think buy a mobile phone under 15k,then that's mobile phone is perfect.
The above all points is only my opinion.If you found any mistake or wrong,then please forgive me.

CAMERA IS NOT GOOD, 4 works only on rear camera not on front cam, no flash light,  in low light photos are enhanced by software which is not good at all, battrey with 6000 Mah is bad then previous A9 Pro which had 5000 Mah. Using fingerprint at back is not comfortable if you want to unlock while placing on table, screen display and it's colours are bad then previous Samsung phones of 2015 ,2016, having 3 camera is waste as old 1.3 megapixel Nokia phone used to click better quality when transferred to Pc and printouts

I was looking for a phone with the best battery performance, with easy to use UI, I am feeling very happy that, Samsung has provided best with this class. and Amazon is provided the best deal and product delivery. Thanks to both of these.
This is my first ever experience with SAMSUNG and Feeling best for the right choice
This phone not only giving a smooth daily task performance, even better camera quality.
before I bought this product, I had been to go through so many Youtubers reviews of all kinds.
Even After all this,  When I  use this phone, believe me It is awesome in this category.
I liked best with this phone are
Battery performance
The Super  AMOLED  screen experience is great in class, and providing  adequate brightness, best Night mode, blur light filter
One UI integration with best of android, easy to use and making daily life easy.
Even Best 3.5mm Jack is back, Cheers SAMSUNG lovers.
Like to add, User has to be more careful with this phone specially for the screen, and use of case cover and screen guard help you to protect this phone from damage. If Samsung provides case cover then, What is better than this!!!!
The expectation from SAMSUNG, I am eagerly waiting for Upgrade with ONE UI based on Android 10

Hats off to Amazon for delivering within 20 hours. Ordered on 28th Sep 2pm and got it on 10am 29th sep that too  on a Holy Occassion of DURGA POOJA.  I'm really happy.
This is my first Samsung Phone. Got it effectively at Rs 11600 after bank discount and cashback. And at 11600 Rs there's no other brand which offers such specs.
Switching from Redmi 3s Prime after 3 years.
I had a lot of confusion about whether I should buy Samsung galaxy m30s or Redmi Note 7 Pro or Realme 5 Pro or Poco F1.
After a lot of research on YouTube and Google I finally decided to go for this Monster because my priorities were Great Display and Battery Life in which no other device can beat this one.

Pros:
1. 6.4" FHD+ Super AMOLED display.😍😍
2. Whopping 6000 mah battery.😱😱😱
3. 48mp triple cam.😋
4. Exynos 9611 same as Samsung A50s which costs 23k.🤗
5. PUBG at HDR with Ultra settings😍😍
6. One UI which is almost close as stock android.😊
7. SAMSUNG brand value.💪💪💪

Cons.
1. Plastic body.
2. No glass protection on display.
3. Fast charging support at 15w only.

If you have a budget around 13k then don't look anywhere just go for this one.

Pros :
1. Colorful bright display
2. Exynos 9611 with 10 NM Superb.
2. Amazing battery backup
3. Great Cameras for outdoor clicks
4. Buttery smooth one UI
5. Does not feel heavier with 6000mAh battery
6. Looks amazing
7. Dedicated slot for micro sd
8. 15 Watts fast charging support. 100% charging 2 hours 30 minutes.very nice
9. Work Dual VoLTE standby.
10. MOBILE IS NOT GETTING HEAT.

CONS:
The camera is good but not looks like 48MP.
FRONT Camera is also OK Ok..

Overall In this Budget It Comes with Great Compact feature ..Thank you Flipkart.

First of lets talk about the key feature of this phone, which is the 6000 mAh battery. This lasts me easily 2 days on a full charge with still a decent 20% left over. I have seen 9 hours SOT (screen on time) in normal usage. This is awesome compared to all the other phones which I have used so far. Buy this phone if battery life is the deal breaker for you. Note that I dont play any intensive games or too many videos.

Camera - Wasn't too impressed with the 48mp feature which made the pictures pixelated. In other modes and in sunlight the pictures come out nicer.

Fingerprint scanner is usually responsive but on occasion I have found it doesn't work. Maybe its dirty fingers or the scanner itself got dirty. Will keep a watch over that.

AOD (always on display) feature is very handy, since this phone doesnt have any Notification LED. Notifications show up on the AOD.

Phone heats up a bit while using camera or charging. If you use a case or cover keep that in mind coz I noticed the heat causes my transparent case to fog up from inside.

Overall, am happy with the phone as its way better than the Samsung Galaxy J8, which I had earlier. That one didn't even have a gyro or compass sensor and this phone at least has that. Even the ambient light sensor works way better than the J8.

Good value for the money in my opinion.

Exceptional Battery Life ; the weight balance of mobile is very good .I never felt like handling a mobile with 6000mAh battery !!!!!
This is absolutely well done . Finger print is quite fast . Memory management is good and can be done through Device Care in built app ..There is no need of third party app. Also digital well being is built in . This allows to keep device fast and healthy.i browse and watch movies on mobile and I get full day and some time one and half day battery life .
The Rapid charger could have been better and not up to mark .Really takes longer times approx 2 hours and 30 minutes to fully charge .which is not appreciated for this kind of price range .How ever camera is just okay and it's not the best in this price bracket .
Low light and night is not really good .This mobile is value for money . The screen and touch sesntivity is up to SAMSUNG quality. Really good viewing experience .The audio is quite loud and overall gives good viewing experience of live TV and offline contents.

Within the price range of ~17,000 for 6GB,128GB model (and ~15000 for 4GB,64GB) this phone is a brilliant option to buy. And the 6000mAh battery, it really monstrous one within this price range. Adding to it is the camera (48Mp + 8Mp(ultrawide)+ 5MP depth sensor) is really an awesome feature of this phone. Although there are some bloatware present in this phone but that's minimal.
Being a huge data and battery using consumer myself, this phone is giving some really satisfactory results. Playing PUBG and Shadow Fight 3 at ultra graphics has very minute lags(all thanks to Samsung's new Exynos 9611 SoC) and the phone can easily sustain 1 whole day with continuous heavy usage with it's humongous 6000mAh battery.In addition to that Samsung's features like data saving, night mode, VPN on Samsung MAX, Ultra data saver and even triple slot SIM tray is like garnish on top of a delicious cuisine. And even the back finish is really best in class, personally I like opal black more than the blue counterpart.

All in all it's a must buy phone if you're looking for an awesome phone within ~15,000/~20,000 budget.

I purchased this phone for my sister and it is working perfectly. It is one of the biggest competitor to Redmi/realme in this price point. The battery life is insane with the huge 6000 mah battery. Also the phone is not much heavy inspite of that huge battery. Also the phone is pretty fast and snapy. The camera is also quite good however I think realme 5 pro might be better. The only con maybe is it doesn't have a ambient light sensor and uses the front camera for this purpose.
Overall a great device with insane battery life. Good service from Amazon.

Screen broke with a minor fall from bed side table (a height of around 1.5 feet). Repair cost is 4.5 k as per service center.Very fragile screen and the screen protection is also not mentioned. Came to know later from the reviews that it has dragontail glass and not Gorilla glass protection.
At the very minimum the screen protection should have been mentioned in the product details for this phone.

Been using it for 4 days now and I can safely say that the battery life is majestic! I also have a OnePlus 6 and I'm tired of it's battery life. This phone lasts more than twice what my OnePlus 6 lasts these days.

Let's start with the pros:

• Battery life - 10/10. I get around 6-8 hours of screen on time and about a day and a half of battery. On my OnePlus 6, I get around 2:30 hours of screen on time and about 12-14 hours of battery life. I am a power user.
• Screen - I was skeptical of the screen quality but I underestimated Samsung's display prowess. Except for the underwhelming viewing angles, this phone's display is more than good enough for its price. About the viewing angle, there is a very noticable color shift when you look at the screen at an angle. But that's about it.
• Samsung UI - I can't believe I'm saying this, but the Samsung One UI is amazing. Well thought out, keeping tall displays in mind. I was a staunch critic of the older Samsung UI. That UI had kept me off of Samsung devices for almost 8 years. One UI is such a far cry from that.
• Audio - The audio output is well beyond its price range. Yes, the headphones do get a bit quite but dolby atmos makes up for it in stereo separation.
• Video Recording - The super steady mode and super slow-mo are amazing. Just wow.

Cons :

• Performance - Yes it indeed is better than the M30 but there are still noticeable lags and stutters all around the UI. Specially multitasking UI and gestures. Which are horrible. Gaming performance is ok, but it's nowhere near Snapdragon 700 series performance. Not even 710.
• Still Camera - The only other reason other than battery for ke to buy this phone was the camera, specifically the wide angle camera. The entire camera array is a mixed bag. Main camera is ok in day light but terrible in low light. Even with night mode.
The wide angle camera captures a good range of view but has pretty much no detail. It's just so badly overprocessed that it starts to look like a painting when you zoom in.
• Fingerprint Reader - I had taken good fingerprint readers for granted being a OnePlus customer. The one on this phone is the worst fingerprint reader I have seen in a long time. Maybe the worst ever. It won't read fingerprints 5 out of 10 time, just won'r respond. The 5 times it does read it, it only successfully recognizes about 2 times. It's the worst thing about this phone.

But, the phone serves my purpose. To be the 2nd phone to my OnePlus 6 by having a teriffic battery life and a not so terrible wide angle camera which my OnePlus 6 lacks.

I ordered  this mobile yesterday at 11:55 am and was delivered 4 hrs later same day. Amazing Amazon.
Now for the mobile after researching  on with various mobiles of vivo, poco and xiaomi i selected this mobile. Particularly coz it has 6000 mah with fast charging supported. I am not much of a camera person but the selfies and wide angle are a delight with 48 megapixel camera .. alongside it has slow and super slow motion with the conventional panorama and new pro feature. In addition it has focus mode and other mode like food mode. The display is nice and finger printer is nice. It also has face recognizer however I found it is not able to recognize me . Display and sound are nice I am not much into gaming but do use mobile exhaustively with movies WhatsApp and telegram and can confirm did not find any issue with heating or anything . Lastly the battery ... it says fast charging but I think it took around 2.5 hrs to get fully charged from 12 percent. I charged it to full at 1:15 am in the night yesterday and the current battery left is 54 percent at 2:47 am which is around 25 hrs which is impressive and is the mobile usp.

Samsung has forgot a good amount of things....like there is no easy mode and accidental touch prevention option and the super slow motion is very confusing to use it has a massive 6000mah battery which is extremely great no complain there but it takes almost 2:30hrs to charge with that 15w included charger I think it should have supported at least 20 or above watt fast charging , camera is good but considering it's a 48mp lens it's not up to the mark super sturdy mode is extremely awesome.......also it doesn't have any haptic feedback.....overall it's a decent mid range product from Samsung......if your budget is around 14k and you want a branded smart phone with decent overall performance you can definitely go for this one

Unfortunately this phone has been stolen on 10 jan 20.  thank to God. I was not much satisfied with this phone. earlier i was using motorola phone which cost was quite lower but has feature equal to this mobile phone.
battery back was initially good but after three months it is behaving like other phone have low power battery. it takes too much time to charge ( around 3 hr) as compare to motorola ( takes 1-1.5 hr).
one more thing, the pictures were not in JPG format it is heic form
Thank God I lost this phone. Now I can purchase new phone

After using 2days
I"ll directly write pros and cons
Cons-
1- Earpiece sound is very bad, you'll hear echo and unclear sound on call.. as well as back side of the earpiece you will feel vibration from the sound coming from earpiece
2- Getting less network in m30s as compare to my other phone in same sim
3- Slow downloading speed from wifi as well as sim internet as compare to other phones.
4- Vibration motor is of very cheap quality.
5- power &amp; volume button are of very cheap quality they will sound like (chit chit) when you'll press it.Very annouing.
6- No app is running in background still 3.1gb memory consumed. Very bad memory management
7- Now the main point- 48mp camera is 48mp only on papers. In real life redmi note 4 can take better picures as compare to fake 48mp camera of m30s
8- super steady mode is zero use it will make your video super grainy and will give heavy jelly effect.. not at all uasable..
9- front camera is no less than a vga camera.. 3rd class
10- pubg is lagging in hdr mode
11- main speaker sounds like 1000rs chinq phone..
12- Some people will find ui pathetic.
13- its back looks cheap &amp; ugly

Pros-
1- battery is very nice
2- screen is too smooth and eye soothing

Don't  fall in the trap of YouTube, these youtubers are heavily paid by samsung to give positive and attactive reviews

I would suggest you to read this review if you are looking for a budget phone with good performance. Mine is 6GB ram with 128gb storage
 First good thing about this phone is the look and the finish.
The fingerprint sensor is on the back of the phone.
Coming to the camera, the triple camera works great .The photo clarity is awesome. The WIDE mode is great to shoot. I love the selfies taken from front camera.
BATTERY: Till now I have used only three phones (all of which is ONLY SAMSUNG) This is only because of their battery. I use almost all the social media throughout the day and the battery doesn't drain out quickly.
I am not a game person so not sure about the gaming experience.
I charge the phone once in a day and it has a quick charge option it's pretty much quick.

LOOK : 5/5
BATTERY : 5/5
CAMERA : 5/5 (For this range of phone)
SPEED : 4/5
OVERALL PERFORMANCE: 4.5/5

I am not a techie person so I may have missed out few details.
I have also posted pics taken from WIDE angle and live focus.

Reasons to Buy-
Pros-:
1.Looks and Apearance (4.8/5)- Lookwise its a good product in its range,Screen looks like curve which is held only in expensive sets,back cover is also so attractive.

2.RAM(4.5/5)- Better processing than M30 .

3.Storage(4.9/5)- Best  in class,as it gives more space for internal memory as other handsets,it provides upto 61 GB availability.

4.Operation( 4.5/5)- Smoother due to samsung chipset.
5.Touchpad (4.2/5)-  quick responding than others that i found previously use oppo and realme handsets.
6.Display(4.9/5)- As always good as Amoled screeen is provided its always better than IPS display.
7. Battary (5.0/5.0)- As high 6000Mh it performance is nice 1.5 day for 95%-10%.
8.Charging(4.8/5.0)- 15W fast chargingis also a good feature for this handset to be prefer.It take only 2.5-3 hrs to charge high rating battary.

Other Reasons (4.8/5.0)-- Low heating after continues use as compared to others.
Less head SAR value (.468)
Expensive look.
Cons-:

1. Camera(4.0/5)- As 48 MP primary camera ,its not so satisfying.
2.Weight(4.0/5)- Just a little bulky.

Overall Rating after 7 day use by me- (4.7/5.0)
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars

Camera: will show you 48 mp no doubt, but the image will pixelate when you zoom. Even normal picture quality (When 48mp is not selected) is also very average. The picture quality looks same just as any 6 year old Samsung phone, nothings changed. Just that its bit better in low light than them.
For the info, 'Pro mode' doesnt have any option to adjust shutter speed or focus distance. And ISO will go only between 100 to 800.

Slow UI: The User interface is disappointingly slow at some points, specially on dialing and ending calls.

Otherwise, the phone is fine and it feels nice to use it as the screen looks very nice.

I purchased this phone one month back. This are my observation afte 1month usage of M30s.
Pros: Long Battery Life. It will easily last 36hrs. Camera is good but not the best in the market at this price segment. Redmi Note 8 Pro has better picture quality. One UI experience is really good, no lag so far. Fingerprint and face regonition is decent.
Processor has been upgraded in this m30s version which really helps. Inspite of having 6000 mah battery, phone is not too heavy.
Super amoled display makes your viewing experience really good. If you are a person who loves binging online video content
.this is the best in these price segment
 With long battery...absolute value for money

Cons: Build quality especially the back panel is made up of plastic. There is certain pop sound near the cameras/fingerprint  reader on back panel. However if you use a back cover, it does the job. This issue is there across all m30s phones.
As i said earlier camera can be better.
Not recommended for hardcore gaming like pubg or call of duty.

Pros
Battrey
Display
Branding.

CONS. Only one problem i found is CAMERA.
CAMERA 48mp. Worst CAMERA from SAMSUNG. DIDNT EXPECTED this frm samsung. 48mp is JUST A GIMMICK. MY 2016 J7 produces far more better pics than this m30s.

Using this phn for 2 mnths... sbbse BEKAR 48MP at this PRICE SEGMENT. NIGHT MODE is WORST.

THIS is the GIMMICK OF 48MP. disappointed from SAMSUNG coz my whole family uses SAMSUNG from TV AC REFRIDGERATOR MOBILE. M30S in terms of CAMERA IS WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER USED.

Phone is great when it comes to performance, audio and colours of the screen, but i felt camera is quite underwhelming because of the following reasons:
1. In Manual mode there is no option to change shutter speed.
2. Max limit for shutter speed is 1/10 secs, which is a lot less than compared to other competitors. Though high speed photography is fine, but no such provision for light painting/slow shutter pictures.

There is one more issue, which is, pictures on my phone are not loaded (i.e. i am unable to view thumbnails after a few weeks).

Apart from above mentioned features, everything else is great. Speakers are loud enough, and produce quality audio. Camera quality is good, front camera is also good. Wide angle camera is quite wide, which helped me alot. Screen colours are absolutely amazing.

hey Guy's,

I ordered SAMSUNG M30s on 29 Sep and arrived next day. I couldn't use this Mobile 5 days after getting it due to I traveled to a village where I won't get any WiFi or network properly so, kept it in box and started using it after 5 days.

the below are issues which I have faced with in short span of time of usage.

1. The very 1st day mobile got hanged couple of seconds while installing apps and mobile is not responding quickly, waste of having 6GB of RAM.

2.When I was in call meanwhile got call from whatsapp then automatically speaker turned on and not able to turn it off and continued the call till end with speaker only, started talking in whatsapp after sometime only able to turned off the speaker.

I'm not a gamer and I don't take pics much, for normal usage purpose only I bought this mobile, previously I used redmi note 3 mobile only, so as I want a change in mobile bought this WORST one, now I'm regretting...REDMI is far better than SAMSUNG.

Waste of 6000MAh Battery, it is coming only 24hrs that to initial days of the mobile usage.

I bought this mobile because of brand only, now I don't have any confidence on SAMSUNG

Don't feel regret after buying it, better to buy any other one instead of wasting money on this scarp.

If there is negative rating I would have given -10 to it.
Totally disappointed with this product, now plan to talk to AMAZON to return it, as I've crossed no of days to return this product.

I have ordered this one for my wife. Overall a good package. But must have included atleast back case and screen protector. Considering it's a plastic built. The build quality was not that great. It's feeling clicky in bottom on both sides. Camera quality is good and not that great. Battery was awesome and descent weight too. Display quality is awesome too ,as it's Samsung super amoled. Ram management is good too. I have ordered 6 GB 128 GB one.Samsung One UI is descent enough. Lacks real time internet speed. Hope Samsung will add this one to the UI in future updates. I don't know how well is Samsung's future updates. Daylight photography is good but in low light scenario it's a different case. But considering the price point Ian ok with it Full charging will take 3 hours minimum from zero to hundred.

Just Superb...its a real Monster which you will love to live with. Recieved it in well packed condition well in time without any observation. Phone is having remarkable performance in almost every function n use conditions. It has a battery which will really shock you as everytime you will go to connect it for charging and you will find its reduced not even for one percent. Battery is the core Monster of this phone which hardly gets exhausted. Camera is very good not as compared to I phone etc, but still the best in its range. Some features of the camera are latest and unique. Speed is awesome with no other demerits such as heating etc. Rest all great. A very good phone which has the stuff as a phone costing beyond 30000 I believe. Value more than money spent...Must bye.

This is my First ever Samsung mobile and trust me when I say, I am in Love with this beast of a Mobile!!!
I am reviewing this phone after a few days of usage and I happen to be an Honest person so the review will also be the same...
Pros:
Battery Life- This happened for the first time, I charged the phone once and have been using it for more than 2 days after every charge!! The best part was, when battery reached 100, it remained 100 for a minimum of 2.5hrs even after continuous usage!!!
Display- Trust me, in this budget, the display provided is way beyond expectations... Watching Flash and Cricket Match on Hotstar was not the same as before, the experience was multiplied by 1000 times better!!!
Sound &amp; Music- Speaker of this phone is even better and watching films on Earphones is like cherry on the top!! Dolby Atmos truly works in this phone...
User Friendly- The looks, the weight, the UI and everything in this phone is very User Friendly... weight of this phone is very less even after having 6000 MAH battery!!
Android Features- Honestly, I have been a bit sceptical about Samsung before, but after experiencing this phone, it'd never be the same... Features provided by samsung on this phone are superb... Android 9 works alot better than Android One! Though, Basic UI of this phone is a bit old fashioned but when you explore this phone you will find ways to make is better...
Speed- There is no hint of slowing down in this phone yet, the processor speed works just fine and I hope it continues forever...
No heating issue- I have been using this phone continously for more than 5 days now and this phone hasn't heated up even for once... In fact, the very first day I had got Gorrilla Glass screen saver and on the corners there are a few air bubbles to which the shop owner said will go after charging coz phone heats up but even after 5 days, it is still the same 😂
Camera- Now let's talk about camera of this phone... I happen to be working in the field of Film Making and trust me people, the camera quality of this phone has pushed me for making my own short film with this phone... I will make it and upload on YouTube!!
Fingerprint reader and Face Unlock- No wastage of time at all... This phone unlocks as soon as it gets locked!!
Cons-
Network Coverage- This is the reason why I rated this phone 4 stars... I have airtel sim and wherever I go, the network always stays with me but not with this phone... when I am inside a House, the network goes to 2 points or 1 point but outside the house it is ofcourse 5 points always and that's cheerful!!
Well to be honest, I haven't faced any other cons yet, if and when I will, I will come back here to update this section...
Thanks alot Samsung for such a beautiful phone!!! 💘

The phone show's ageing symptoms which should not happen as it is a brand new phone..I bought it on dussehra festival day. The phone gets restart while opening some webpage or doing something  and this frequency is growing or happening in a day or two although I don't play any games on it ..while opening apps such as for e.g. while opening Amazon app the contents of the app takes time to show which should not happen..in the camera department they have given ultra wide angle plus slow motion but of what use..the camera quality is just average although the preset in the camera reduces the quality to 12 megapixel but the quality is not more than that of 8 mp...camera is a failure and  this frequency restarting of the mobile is very annoying..the build quality of the phone is really compromised I think..only the battery and display of the phone is good that's why 3 stars...samsung should give software updates for why the phone is restarting..at present I feel disappointed with the phone..

I have purchased 4gb/64gb opal black variant. After placing the order, got it delivered within 24 hours.
I wasn't expecting much from this device within this price range.

Design &amp; Body : Fibre body  but feels premium with amazing color and design.

Display : By default display doesn't look like superAmoled. User need to change the screen mode from Natural to Vivid, then it becomes feast to the eyes.

Battery : Even With the monstrous 6000mAh battery this device doesn't feel heavy and performs with it's full potential.
Camera: If you expect that camera will click super crisp and awesome images without any efforts then you will not appreciate the quality that M30s produces. Every hardware needs equally good software to produce good output. Same goes with the Samsung Galaxy M30s's camera. For better quality images you just need to learn how to use its camera app and it will never disappoint you.
Finger Print : Finger print sensor is very fast and responsive.
Processor: Exynos 9611 octa-core chipset based on a 10nm process gives smooth experience while playing games.
Final Conclusion : It's a value for money device with this price range. The only thing I was expecting was there must be screen guard and normal silicon back cover included inside the box.

Photo quality is worst. As an user of dslr, p&amp;s cameras, smart phones with good photography capability i understand this samsung phone camera hardware may be good, but the image processing software, algorithm etc are not good at all. Hence the final output is very very bad.
Samsung must look into this and release updated camera software. Otherwise it's going to be a strictly no go zone. People should not buy this phone.
Second bad thing is battery back up and battery management. They advertise with Arjun bajpai. I thought it will have good backup. However it is disappointing. Every alternate day i have to charge. I don't use any games or download many things. It's general phonecalls and net surfing and couple of photographs. However the phone charge do not last more than a day.
And the charger is incapable because the battery size is huge and charger charging power is less. Hence it takes about 6 hours to charge full. Every night i am leaving this on charge and morning it is ready to use. But by night battery drains out.
Is there any option to return this device since I am not satisfied with the performance of the phone?

This is my secondary phone (iphone is primary). Been using it for few days now. Very impressed with this AMOLED display, big battery and ease of use. Samsung UI is far superior to Redmi and Realme. Phone is a pleasure to hold, looks and feels nice even though back is plastic. Camera is average, no complaints. Response to gestures is fast. Battery charges fast and lasts long. Even has FM radio. Happy with this choice. Recommended for everyday use.

I m already using S9 PLUS 256GB model and recently got good offer while purchasing this M30s with exchanging old lenovo k6 power.
One thing I want to clear that this M30s phone is just superb.In such a budgetary phone features r comparable to even high end smartphones.
Many must be giving poor reviews based on camera but camera is also good.

It's a perfect deal dont believe in negative comments just buy it u won't regret.

Samsung smartphones r known for their super amoled screen which not even companies like apple can match and this phone is not an exception.

If u want any questions u can ask I will reply

Totally superior quality.  I had mi note 5 pro earlier and now when I ran a small test where i played same YouTube video on full brightness &amp; full volume  on both phones, this phone totally beats note 5 pro... video quality, sound quality is amazing.  Plus the battery, feels safe to carry it on long drives. Ine important thing to note is the BLACK in videos  m30s has true black.. whereas in note 5 pro, i could easily  see poor picture quality as black wasn't true black, it was opaquely black.. with a white tinge. Plus it has a memory card slot, great.. also dolby atmos surround for headphones.

Now move on to cons- i have heard the screen quality isn't great.. which is disappointing  as I'll now be extra cautious not to drop it . Second, the phone doesn't come with a back cover. Third- it should have a notification LED that will make things easier.

Performance - OK kind of, smooth interface
Camera - Not Satisfied, Night clicks pixels wash off, its 48MP just on papers
Battery - 1day only that too normal usage, even when i dont play games at all, dont know what 6000Mah does here.

Cons
Heating issue sometimes, dont know why ??

NOTE: Buy it like a normal phone, without expecting much, dont think like its a Monster that you will get in price range of 14000/-

So overall decent one by Samsung.

Pros:
Massive battery
Decent camera

Cons:
-Poor speaker
-Modem has an issue, network strength and call quality.This is due to Exynos 9611 processor. Snapdragon performs better
-Slow charging even though its a 2A/5V 10W charger
-No screen casting

In the same price range you have other phines that perform better than this. This was not worth the money spent.

It's a good device. The main USP is the massive battery. Value for money. Much better than the Realmes/Vivos/Oppos etc.
Pros:
1. Battery. Easily lasts 2 days.
2. Lightweight.
3. Runs most of the apps without much trouble.
4. UI is smooth.
Cons:
1. Camera is just average. Front camera is pathetic.
2. Pretty ordinary plastic body. Very much slippery.
3. Fingerprint reader is not very fast. It takes a while to detect the fingerprint.

When I just look at the better it's killer what a battery back up all performance good except body,
and fingerprint sensor body is polycarbonate and I'm my 6gb 128gb version i got scratch on back side in just 4 days of purchase fingerprint some times not work properly but in performance killer phone, if u want monster in battery life just go for it. But compromise with body, fringerprint sensor.

My mobile is gone dead after 14th day of purchase date. Samsung customer care is very poor. Samsung service center refused for replacement. I have registered number of compliant in Samsung customer care. Yet to receive response.

My advice, this product has been launched recently. It is having hardware issues. So dont buy this product.

Last two weeks without smartphone i am facing difficulties due to defective piece of Samsung M30s delivered to me.

First of the product is very solid in hand.
There were many complaning that the built quality is not good and some sort of sound is coming fron side panel and near the biometric senser but all that claim is seem to defame the brand as I had not noticed any such kind of sound in my device.

The display quality and brightness cannot be compared with any other devices in this price segment.

Camera rear quality is good and can be improved via updates.

Front camera is not upto the mark as it not abke to capture detail and make the photo some what blurry. Can be improved via updates as it is capable hardware to capture good selfie.

Battery life is good as it is huge.

No heating issue reported yet.

One UI software is very smooth and had good features. Excellent performance and very well optimised. Very good interface.

Very good from other Chinese brand devices.

Sound Quality is averag.

Network coverage is also good and call Quality is awesome.

At this price and considering brand value it is best device in this price segment.

Cons:
•pathetic camera quality.. didn't even feel 13MP with the 48MP camera..the camera of the lower variant M30 is superb and here they couldn't deliver that quality let alone better it.
•Late responsive finger-print scanner
•The UI is just not right.. small things can make or break things for user.. making a user friendly UI isn't something Samsung has done here. Eg:
&gt;&gt;The app search bar doesn't open with the keyboard automatically.. what's the use of it then
&gt;&gt;The multiple wallpaper option is for lock screen but not the phone wallpaper.. lol
&gt;&gt;You can't setup DPs for Apps like FB whatsapp from the photo gallery.. you can do it through the app only... Even way smaller brands like Mi and Honor have this. Maybe Oppo and Vivo eid have this
&gt;&gt; Etc, etc.
•the Gradient blue phone color is yuck!! Disgusting blue to sea-green Gradient could have been better

Neutrals:
•The phone is thicker and heavier than M30 considering the 6kMAH battery, I'm fine with it
•premium feel of the phone
•design and bezel less screen

Pros:
•honestly.. nothing special other than this being a SAMSUNG phone

I am using samsung android mobiles since long time, but this time i think i made a mistake that i purchased m30s.

While in same price i will get best mobiles from other companies i choose m30s which was irritating me from the first day of purchase. Samsung says this phone has 6000 mah mega battery with 15 watt fast charger but i have to spend more than 3 hours to get fully charged and after that when i start to use mobile the battery goes down very fast and after latest software update i am unable to use flash, ultrawide and beauty in 3:4 48MP mode.

I realised that i made a big mistake to choose samsung as most preffered brand for mobiles.

Amazing phone at an amazing price.

Most appropriate screen size which is large enough but does not hurt when kept in pocket. Tripple camera takes some amazing photos. I liked the selfie camera also with 16 mega pixel. Battery goes on and on even after very heavy uses.  It is working for more than two days on an average.

Tripple camera allows great time lapes ckverage. Phone is sleak compare to A70 or A50.  From feature and price points, it was an awesome deal.

Compare as per the price its the best you can have. I have purchase it on 28th Sept when the sale for prime members start

Pros
Battery life - if used in full power mode battery last for exactly 1 days and if used in medium power noder it last fot more than 1.5 days minimum in moderate use. Don't use super power saving its just waste until unless you use the phone ONLY FOR CALLING

Looks and screen - plastic back but feel and look is great and coming towards screen aspects if you are using the phone with SUPER AMOLED screen difference would be easily noticeable.

Interface - smooth and can be customized lag free till now

Cons
Camera - when used in outdoor condition it is very very good color and details are very good but when used in indoor it is below avg

Whom to buy - if you're looking for a phone which lasts the needs of parental needs it the best the you can go for BATTERY that matters most

I love this phone, mine one is a 6GB ram version Sapphire Blue. This is working like breeze, battery life is decent, charging is fast, no bloats, camera is satisfactory at this price range, screen is excellent, touch is super fast, user interface is awesome. I just love every aspect of this phone.
However, few of the things I did not like is that I have to download Samsung Max VPN from google and NO INTERNET CONNECTION WITHOUT VPN function is not allowed, few good fonts have been removed like ROSEMARY, COOL JAZZ, and CHOCO COOKY. Good fonts are only downloadable after paying. And some more options may have been given in Themes and Wallpapers.
But this can be rectified by samsung by allowing more compatible Themes, Wallpapers, AODs, and Fonts as free in Galaxy Themes App.

Product is offered at such price range due to competition in the segment but the reputation of such big brand should not have been compromised.poor camera quality for selfies, no earphones lead  provided ,charging lead length is so small not even 1meter, bad product and very unhappy with the same ,Amazon delivery was on time and good rest all is not upto mark except 6000 mh battery ,disappointed ,oppo f11, real me seems far much better.

Amazon and Samsung cheating customers by selling worst mobiles ever...
Even I'm unable to take single image getting, above error and mailny worst performance and bad quality...
  When I called to Amazon customer care to return this worst product they are not allowing me and explaining silly things like policy , basic troubleshooting.

Ive bought Sony, Nokia, Lenovo, and  Xiaomi in the past, so switching to Samsung brand was not that easy for me. In fact, this is my first ever choosing a Samsung smartphone. Really the first impression that caught my ey was the battery power.  Im reviewing this phone after using it for a week.
Pros:
1. Display is excellent crisp and clear. Watching movies in a dream come true display ( also there are two settings vivid and normal) although vivid is more bright but it will use more power. Secondly youve got to protect the screen using screen guard and use a back cover to protect from potential damage. This is an area Samsung can improve.

2. Sound: speaker sound is loud and clear. Also incoming and outgoing calls are handled easily and yes it has call recorder which is again excellent. My previous Xiaomi mi a2 phone did not have an inbuilt recorder plus even after installing recorder from playstore the audio was distorted.

3. Camera/Video: I dont agree over several underated reviews by people on camera/videos. Please dont follow them, hey are just doing it to promote other brands. Camera is again the best in in the class if yiu compare with mid segment phones. I do notice there was a warmth in color and image doesnt seem original, but thats because by default the beauty settings are switched on. Once its off, and maintain the settings both rear and front camera work excellent in all light conditions.. remember lowlight means yu need to give more exposure. Regardingvrear camera flash it looks a bit weak but still okay. Front camera has screen flash andvworks perfectly in capturing selfies in extreme lowlight conditions. Videos are captured perfectly, it has both slow motion and hyperlapse.

4. Fingerprint reader: works just fine. Although it takes a second or 2 sometimes to detect it.

5. Battery: best in its class, 6000 mah can carry the work throughout the day. Although keep a check on battery draining apps or settings to get max power. Keep sync off, use power saving mode and switch off location when not required.

6. Processor: never lags..not seen it so far, works like a breeze.

7. Network: again excellent reception

8. Handling: will cause a bit strain on the hand when using it single handedly

9. Keyboard: Samsung default keyboard is a bit laggy so I use Google keyboard which works perfectly

10. Ui one: user friendly and has option to change wallpaper, screensaver, always on display and several advanced features.

Cons: fingerprint reader lags, rear camera flash could be better and display and back could be stronger

Update my final review aftr a month. In the end I would like to thank Samsung for creating a Monster phone at a Mini price!!

Pro: Display, touch screen response.

Con: Everything else are cons. Call drop, heating, camera quality feels max 12mp only, battery feels like 4000mah only, built quality poor. If u r traveling, keep another phone to talk.

My 3 year old note 4 was much faster.

For now, I can only compare the M30s with the Asus Zenfone 5z and a OnePlus 3T, both of which 'were' flagships of the respective brands. In the past I have used Motorolas exclusively. I 'was' a big Motorola fan and consider stock android as the best user experience on a smartphone.

Pros
1. Display 5/5 – Big, Beautiful but more importantly a well-calibrated one. It's easily better than the Oppo and Vivo AMOLED implementations, simply because Samsung has taken the pains to somehow calibrate each unit.

2. Ergonomics 5/5 – You are unlikely to call this device bulky or cumbersome for one-handed use because of the 20:9 aspect ratio, excellent weight management and OneUI optimisations for one-handed use.

3. Battery Life 4/5 – 11-12hrs SoT for me i.e. 1.5days use. Frankly, it's a bit disappointing considering that my older Motorolas gave 6-8hrs on 13nm architecture SoCs, had 2,700-3,000 mah batteries and had less efficient LCD panels. At 6,000mah it should've given close to 14hr SoT, for my use-case.

4. Performance 5/5 – Very fast app opening speeds! Compares very well with the Snapdragon 821 powered and phenomenally well optimized OnePlus 3T. Falls short of the Asus 5z, which is a no-brainer. RAM management is decent too, of the 4GB RAM I tend to have 1.5GB free. 8-10 non-game apps are typically always in memory. UFS 2.1 is a Big leap for those of us upgrading from eMMC storage. This is particularly noticeable in both app opening speeds as well as in the gallery app where Images and Video thumbnails load instantly. Deleting is also super fast!

5. Touch Response 5/5 – Fast, precise, with low latency. Particularly noticeable on the keyboard, quick toggle menu, as well as when knocking off notifications or deleting feeds on say, the Chrome browser. Faster animations further this experience.

6. One UI 3.5/5 – It's difficult to rate it because I've ALWAYS used stock android. And although I enjoy the add-ons OneUI comes with I also miss the clean, fluid, conflict-free experience that stock android is known for. Mind you, this is FAR better than the Chinese ROMs that I tried out in offline stores; ColorOS, FuntouchOS, MIUI and even ZenUI. OneUI is less obtrusive, cleaner, has no ads and is easier to use one-handed. OneUI isn't flawless, I have experienced app crashes (Tata Sky and Palabre) on when I never faced any issues with them with my previous phones. It does ship with bloatware, asks for a LOT of permissions, has unrequired 'suggestions'. Though all of that can be shut down within 5mins. What you do have to put up with is – stutters. You see them from time to time. It may not be a deal breaker, but yes it's clearly a step-down from stock android. For me, if Stock android is 100... Oxygen OS gets a 100 too, One UI gets 85 and ZenUI gets 75. The other Chinese skins (MIUI, ColorOS, FuntouchOS) are definitely far more heavily modified and further away from the core experience android is known for.

7. Call Quality and Cellular Reception 5/5 – I actually placed calls from all the weak spots at home where signals drop to just 1 bar. Thankfully the M30s doesn't drop signals more than other phones that I've used in fact it's a shade better than the Motorolas I had previously. It's not a mind-blowing signal-catcher either, but yes I do get internet on my Jio sim where sometimes the other phones would struggle. Call quality was Good too, slightly better than the 5z but just short of the OnePlus 3T. Compared to 5z, the sound is sharper (but never sibilant) as opposed to being slightly more muffled and recessed in the upper frequencies.

8. Reliability/Peace of mind and a vast Service network.

Cons
1. Build quality 3/5 – Its a unibody plastic build but a rather flimsy grade of plastic has been used. You can feel and at times also hear the plastic flex next to the power button and the fingerprint scanner. The button themselves have a short travel and satisfactory tactility. Most Chinese phones (which I checked out at offline stores) offer a better build and have Gorilla Glass too, which is rated higher than Schott or Asahi's dragontail (used here), especially in terms of drop protection. For scratch resistance this should be ok, hopefully.

2. Charging performance 2/5 – 2hrs 30mins is very 2015 (6,000 mah, I know). Perhaps an 18w charger helps shave off 15mins or so?, I'll give an update on that. What's more irksome is that if you are using the phone while charging it significantly slows down charging speed (3.5hrs or so!), this is a difference you can't miss. It does not happen on the other devices I have at home, to this extent.

3. Cameras 2/5 – I've used SLRs/DSLRs for over 2 decades so I understand a thing or two. Which also means I don't expect phones, especially at this price point to do great. Even with toned down expectations the cameras are rather poor. The '48mp' Detail is absent, dynamic range mediocre and there's over sharpening/ringing too, though colours are thankfully more natural than I expected from Samsung. Frankly, the '48mp', '64mp', '108mp' number dropping these days is wayyy deep into gimmicky territory because these things at best may be a tad better than older 12/16mp modules, when implemented right. I can only say that it's nowhere near the 12mp primary camera on the Asus 5z (especially with gCam, at night). What's good is the Video Stability &amp; super slow motion feature. Stabilization is actually better than the other two, especially surprising if you know that both 5z &amp; 3t have OIS, this does not! I will update this section if/when I can compare it against its class.

4. LTE speeds over Jio 2.5/5 – A bit disappointing actually. Here it's more like the 6-series from 2018. Even with UFS 2.1, app downloading over Jio was very similar to the older phones I've used. Nowhere close to the 3t, leave alone 5z. Mind you, the Snapdragon 7-series is FAR closer to the 835/845 on this category.

5. Heapdhone quality 3/5 – I'm not a hardcore audiophile but I've spent a small fortune on audio over the years. The m30s has a lively presentation with good dynamics and respectable detail but the frequency response isn't flat. The bass is clearly boosted and the upper frequencies are muted. Its definitely a flavoured sound unlike my Moto G5 Plus which had phenomenally clean audio and superb stereo separation (price no bar!), with my Audio Technica ath-m50, Soundmagic e10c and Beyerdynamic Byron I never had a complaint. The M30s has better detail for sure but it's a more central ('in your head'), less neutral sound. The Hidizs Sonata HD is a good option if you want a solid upgrade for around 2-2.5k, if you want to go cheaper still try the pixel Type-C to 3.5mm dongle there's a lot of praise for it and it's available for just 1.3k or so.

6. Lack of XDA love – The XDA community showers tons of love to Snapdragon powered phones in making them cleaner/slicker/customizable with Custom ROMs because Exynos is locked out by Samsung :(

7. Speaker performance – Not bad but certainly nothing above mediocre. At least it's not that ear piercing, shrill sound that some models at this price point are plagued with and its loud too. OnePlus 3T has a significantly cleaner, tighter output. I won't even bother drawing a comparison with the 5z ;)

8. Android Update track record – I found that Samsung has one of the slowest update speeds, 6-10 months after official release (if you're lucky!). Which probably means no Android 10 until March 2020 :( May be things change in the OneUI era?

First impressions, a full 5/5.
I'll update with Long-term findings.

--- 7th October, 2019. 1-week update ---

One UI experience.
So I've begun to appreciate OneUI in its entirety. The stutters have reduced, I guess when the phone was new there was a lot happening in the background. Besides, some of the intrusive stuff was still running which I've since force stopped and disabled.

The features that I think are great additions over stock android...
1. Open in pop-up view – True multitasking! A huge plus in my book.
2. Always on display – A great feature to have on an AMOLED display and a 6,000mah battery.
3. The screenshot toolbar – it's well designed and the added functionality is much appreciated.
4. Gesture based quick app switcher – A neat and well implemented way of quickly moving through apps
5. 9-band Equaliser – The presets and the fully customizable graphic equaliser have system wide effect over audio, a very underrated feature.
6. Dark/Night mode – Android 10 will bring this at the system level. But it doesn't hurt to have it at some level already, even if its only for the system apps.

What I think are half-baked or unrequired features...
1. Aggressive auto brightness – The ambient light sensor almost always chooses a brighter than required output.
2. Assistive touch – 2 pages to swipe through is a good idea but most of it is of absolutely no use! And there's no option to customise it either.
3. Screenshot shortcuts – They've given 3 bad ways of doing it. And the award for the worst experience goes to... "Palm swipe"! Not only is it inconsistent but also senselessly cumbersome. 3-finger swipe on my Motorola worked flawlessly and was faster too. I tried the Assistive touch but that always-on-screen button soon became an eyesore. So I ended up with the Power button + Volume down key :(

All my other 'first impressions' remain unchanged.

A piece of advice for prospective buyers:
If the negative reviews confuse you, please understand this – The negative reviews are by people who have either...
1. Bought the device for the wrong reasons.
2. Or have unrealistic expectations from a device that was available under 12k, at launch.
3. Or have a genuine issue with a bad unit (a very small percentage).
4. Or are paid trolls!
Most of the negative reviews seem to fall in category 1. &amp; 2.

The USPs of this device are...
1. A Very Very good display – It's accurate, most cheap AMOLED sporting devices are not. Which is why you get unnatural skin tones and unrealistic greens/reds with some other mid-range phones (Mi A3, Realme XT, Vivo z1x etc.)
2. One UI – A FAR cleaner alternative to Chinese skins/ROMs
3. Excellent battery life – 11/12hrs of SoT!
4. Fast app opening speeds and RAM management
5. Reliability!

I ordered a case but it hasn't been delivered yet.
Despite that there's not one scratch on the display or the back!

You will be disappointed if you are buying this device particularly for...
1. Build quality
2. or Camera performance
3. or Charging speed
4. or Superfast updates
5. or for making NFC payments (via Google pay or Samsung pay). Though not many outlets accept this in India, at least not in Tier 2 cities, as of 2019.

Also remember that all other alternatives will come with their own set of drawbacks too.
Can't have it all, not in 2019 at least.

Rating unchanged, fully satisfied "for the price paid!"

Earlier I had defective piece which amazon replaced it , now this phone is working super smoothly,  and added to this is the clean look on Samsung One UI , both combined make the experience great . I nearly have 10-20 apps running in the background and none gets out of memory . 6000 mAh battery is more than enough and the fast charger comes in the box which charges this jumbo battery within 2 hrs . USB type c and ultra wide is really fun . Comes with AR emoji , I used it and it is great to have this in a mid ranger phone  . Digital welbeing is good to keep a check on yourself . software things can be improved with updates like in built screen recorder , Samsung Secure folder and built in app locker . But I am optimist about samsung and One UI.  And forgot to mention , but the screen quality is something with which you will fell in love , because color reproduction are great and outdoor visibility is too good . So it will be a good investment in this phone without any doubt .

This is my second mobile because I already replaced same mobile and I don't know  day by day Samsung company mobile is given patahatic features which showing something else and it's not working ......

  Phone is getting heat when charging and using on net,
Phone rear  camera quality is not like 48mp it's like 12mp,
Speaker is also not good on calling and vedios ,
Battery is not working as 6000Mh ..... I really thought Samsung is doing something to get back in the mid segment market with a quality product, but doesn't look like it. The only positive in this mobile is the battery, but it's too early to comment on it. Camera is not upto the mark, no gorila glass protection and more importantly this has sim detection issue especially Vodafone and idea. Bought this mobile but unable to use it.
I'm getting problem in network also with Vodafone , Airtel , jio and BSNL ......

Cons:
- Camera is of poor quality
  -  Portrait photos are much inferior than my previous phone MiA1, background blurring is not accurate and looks like done digitally
  -  48 or whatever megapixel it is, does not feel at all so

- Fingerprint reader is vertically oval, and not round. It makes difficult to read as our finger is generally at an angle to the fingerprint reader. Furthermore, it asks to cover entire region, which is not at all natural at the angle. Phone does not vibrate either, on sensing the finger.

- Face recognition unlocks even with eyes closed, which is very insecure.

Pros: Just the battery is good

I have used Samsung for more than 8 years but this model is very disappointing
Phone heats a lot
Software is very bad many features are missing as compared to other phones of same range. Like app permission, App Lock. Call recording starts anytime. Recording voice is not clear. Shows wrong internet usage. Dual sim support is very bad. Mobile network is bad with all the providers local or international. Camera quality is average. Battery Charging takes long time. Sensors misbehave, while call the screen is activated and sometimes phone goes on mute. Overall this model from Samsung is very disappointing.

Pros: 1. The battery back up is very good. I'm not a over user and with moderate usage, it's last 2days.
2. Front camera is good when compare to back though it's 48mp.
3. Screen size is big, good for movie watchers and game lovers.
4. Finger print reader is good. If u move finger fast, it cannot read.
Cons: phone is heavy. If u use any back cover it will become heavier.
My review is based on just 20days usage. I'm satisfied. Overall, I suggest go for it if u want a branded phone in 15k.

This Samsung M30s is a Monster.
CAMERA:
When everyone is complaining about the camera, I have no issues with it, Because you need to know basics to click the right click, and if you do every picture will be perfect.

BATTERY:
Approx 2hrs 22Mins if you invest to charge with15w fast charging from 0-100 with a Monster use you can take this to a overall 2 days Use.

Sound:
Excellent balance of sound and with Dolby atmos preloaded for headphone usage is actually like a cherry on cake.

Super Amoled screen:
The super Amoled screen will make everything go Live.

Overall a Phone you don't need to think before buying, just go and make a investment.

Cons: well, Samsung should have provided a back cover, I think with 6000 Mah power battery 18W charger should have been there, but battery backup is excellent so no issues.

#GoMonster. Thank you Amazon.

First thing the screen is amazing it's way better than oppo and realme or mi which I was using earlier, second I love the finger print lock it's flawless not a great fan of face lock so can't say,now what I wanna say most important  feature which lot of people don't talk is music ,its great in this phone I use sennheiser headphones  and they have dobly atmos for headphone which gives beautiful sound I think they have used great dac and all genres  of music sound great if you r music lover like me go for it .there are no lags though i don't play games a lot but normal3 task go effortlessly samsung has really made this phone great with premium features
 Of its flagship phone you can blindly buy this phone go for it avoid negative comments.

A perfect phone at perfect price

SuperAMOLED display is charming
When you open a blank black image in dark room , you can find absolute black ( pixels go off for black pixels , you can't even find where is your phone in dark room ) as SuperAMOLED displays don't have backlight  and it also saves battery power
Whereas in other phones with normal LCD displays you will see some light for black image

Performance of phone is superbbb
I have played PUBG , COD , Asphalt and many other games ... no heating issues

Fingerprint reader is very fast
I also use face recognition... sometimes it just unlocks by face detection even before i touch my fingers on the sensor

Camera is best at this price range
Nowadays all phones comes with 48 MP camera
But it will easily beat all it's competitors
4th image ( toy truck ) is taken in low light
Slow motion videos are great

And also it has good software features which makes it stand out of the crowd

Many features that are available only in this phones but not in competitors are :

1. Advanced features like Smart Stay , Smart alert ,Easy mute,  Lift to wake up , double tap to wake up , finger sensor gusteres ( search internet to know about these features in detail )

2. Ultra power saving mode
It can extend your battery charge for more than 10 days .. you will be able to use your phone like Basic phone while turning only few necessary apps of your choice

3. MS office comes along with device

4 . Beautiful interface ... thanks to One UI
One UI 2.0 with Android 10 is coming soon
You can hide the navigation bar as you have seen in Galaxy S10 ... so bigger screen

If you haven't used Samsung phone before you ll be definitely amused by the interface ( you should explore every settings to know ... there are lots of stuffs packed in )

5. Steady mode in video recording is extra ordinary

6. Scene optimizer in camera works superbb
Automatically detects what are you capturing and take shots perfectly suited for that ... you can also turn off if you don't want

7. You can customize how notifications of each app should behave
You can set different sounds,  vibrate on or off for each different app
I have only turned notifications for messages , inportant mails , whatsapp personal messages ( group notifications turned off )

8. Worth mentioning you don't have to install many apps ( utility softwares ) for user interface as it already comes with many good features One UI
It has device memory cleaner , storage booster , ultra data saving

9. It comes with security software powered by McAfee
Also you can install Knox which will give protection at chip ... even if your phone is lost no one can get your data if you ve installed Knox

10. Cons:
Don't expect so much from super slow motion 960 fps as it captures clip for very few seconds

A true competitor at this price range. Never believed Samsung will be competing successfully at this segment of mobiles. But, surely they have done a commendable job.
Pros
1 - Wide angle camera is gorgeous. True wide angle. Best in segment even under 30k category.
2- Battery is super.
3- Display is fluid. Blacks are perfect.
4 - Camera stabilization works like a charm.
5 - Updates are coming quick as of now. Pretty close behind flagship.

Cons
1 - Software improvements a definite need.
2 - A lot of bloatware.
3 - AI can still improve.

Overall a great offering by Samsung in below 15k segment. A winner for me. Happy with the purchase.  Great companion as a standby.  Actually more than that ...

I got samsung M30s on 1st October 2019. After 7 days usage my personal feedback of this mobile is writing here.
Bad:-
1. Unsatisfactory Build Quality. Not Sturdy back. Crackling sounds on sides bezels of back and back side. (Cannot be rectified by Samsung)

2. Some Lags and Hangs here and there while opening system apps and 3rd party apps. (Can be rectified by Samsung with an OTA update)

3. Heating issues while using for gaming. (Can be rectified by Samsung with an OTA update)

4. Battery Optimisation - Battery Draining Heavily While using out of box, heating while charging also. (Can be rectified by Samsung by giving an OTA update for Ram and Battery Optimisation)

5. Cameras are good, but should be improved low light Image Quality of Rear and Front cameras. Front camera clarity is like 5mp only. Camera image Quality and clarity must be Improved.
( can be rectified by Samsung via an OTA update )

Good:-

1. Samsung Galaxy M30s Display.
sAmoled Display with Full Hd+ Resolution.

(As we all know that Samsung Displays are best in market compared to other super Amoled displays used in Realme , vivo , Oppo)

2. Latest One Ui, Yes the One Ui from Samsung is better than Many other available in market like Color os , funtouch os, Miui , Emui, ofcourse miui is 2nd best ui.

3. 6000 Mah (5830 mAH) battery is a + for this device if and only if battery was optimised for the ui and software through an OTA update.

4. Good Processor for the price we pay, yes there are other rivals for this phone, providing the best Snapdragon 7 Series.
But processor also can be optimised by Samsung to give better performance.

5. Cameras , ufs 2.1 storage, lpddr4x ram, dual sim volte, expandable storage option.

* Samsung 48mp camera technology is ' pixel binning ' that we see on many phones now a days. Its 48mp Is also same, 4 × 12mp = 48mp* &amp;

* Except build Quality, Samsung can Rectify above Bad points through an OTA update, if this was done Quickly it's a Good Device for the price *

Tip:- For Good Protection of device use Hard case for back and Tempered glass for Front. * As it was Plastic body one small drop can damage entire device.

* The Business which Betrays the Customers never be stand or stay longer *

*After about a week update : poor battery life,  definitely not more than a regular 3500mah phone.  Also their fast charging is nothing longer the VOOC charging of oppo phones :-(
Had very big expectations from this phone but not up to mark..

I just got mine 2 days ago, so it's a bit too early to judge.  The camera both front and back are satisfactory and deliver good color reproduction as well. If you want a DSLR quality picture,  then better to go buy a DSLR itself,  but for any average user, the quality of picture from both cameras are more than satisfactory.  Even the low light photos are 100% better than my old iPhone 7 plus.

The phone's 6000mah battery adds to its overall weight, though it's considerably lighter than most models with similar display and half it's  battery size.  I was smitten by the light weight A series models but went for this one owing to its camera and battery specs.

The phone did not come with a ton of unwanted apps and most can be uninstalled.  There were some apps that got removed from the homescreen when I " uninstalled" it bit where showing up in the apps settings, but could be deleted again from there as well.

The settings panel though not as good as my oppo F9pro gets some time getting used to, but has most features available for customization.

Also the swipe feature for typing has been maintained even though I do not see controls for adjusting its speed/ lag which is a tad bit disappointing.

Processing speed for opening and loading apps is a bit slower than my oppo F9 pro with the same 6GB ram configuration, but not too irritatingly slow.  Had trouble loading Amazon app a few times but right now working perfectly well.

Next comes the "fast charging". Its faster than most normal C type cable ones, but doubtful if it's as fast as the VOOC charger of Oppo. But then again the battery capacity is almost double than in F9pro and may be that's why feeling that it's not fast enough.

Battery life and heating on continuous usage is yet to be seen. I've binged watched videos all day long in my oppo and had faced no hearing issues,  hoping that Samsung will also not disappoint me in that area.

Haven't installed any games yet so can't comment on its performance in real time processor intensive ones.

One thing I've noticed, that was pointed out by another reviewer as well is the signal strength.  I'm hardly getting 1-2 bars inside my home where I used to get 2-3 in my oppo easily. Yet to see how it's going to affect the battery life !

Overall it's not a bad buy,if you have good signal strength in your commute area,  battery should also last longer.

I am using this M30S for 45 days. I bought this as I wanted large battery capacity, this has 6000 mAh. The Camera does not seem to meet its expectations. Call functions and Screen are very good. But, Battery takes unusually very long time to attain full charge ( Of course 6000 mAh, even then the time taken is longer than it should be) So also battery does not last long enough. But because it is 6000 mAh it stretches, even with limited usage, the battery drains fast. Camera Quality is just average. But the Wide Angle feature is really good. And Slow video is also good. I bought the 128 GB version, hence, it has sufficient memory. Speed over all is not bad. Both face recognition and Finger Print Bio-metric recognition is not very fast and it also not consistent. Over all it is an average phone.

Overall it was a great deal within budget price for me , total I had to spend 11600 for this (1399 rs instant discount on sbi card and 1000 rs instant cashback on amazon pay )
Elegant finish, camera quality not up to the mark , battery life is average as it having 6000 mah capacity  , sound is too loud
Overall 2days experience is good

I am sharing my 2 day experience(with no sim inserted as it requires nano sim and mines is micro sim)

1) Charger cord is very small in length. You will need a table or chair always if your plug point is in height.
2)Camera quality is average.
3)Fingerprint reader is descent, though sometimes it takes 2-3 times for it to read my fingerprint. May be I am a 1st time user of finger print so may be facing this.
4) Battery is good, but need to use more to come to right conclusion as I have not inserted my sim card yet.
  I had charged it to 100% and after overnight on next day it still remained 100%.
  Previous day battery was at 49% and after overnight the next day it was 48%

Phone is slim and looks are good.  A descent phone to purchase. I will update again after some days.

I am not completely satisfied with amazon as they withdrew the offer of Rs.1000 amazon cashback within 2 days. This offer should have remained from 29th sep to 4th oct 2019(offer period). In this case there is no difference even if you buy this phone after the festive period as price remains the same. Though I am satisfied with the deal, if amazon pay cashback of Rs. 1000 would have remained I would have been more satisfied.

The battery life is excellent.
The camera has surpassed my expectations.
The fingerprint reader is a bit slow for my liking, and does'nt read my finger if there's even if there is a little sweat on it. The display is really good. The support of Dolby Atmos only makes the phone better. Normal charging for the phone takes a while to charge fully but the battery life makes up for it. Overall its a must buy for the price.

I bought the product on the very first day of great Indian sale ( 6GB variant).
To be honest the phone is awesome and it's worth for the money.
6000Mah battery is very good it lasts easily for 1.5 days if you are full time user..For Moderate user it will last definitely more than 2 days.

Look wise the phone is very sleek and premier..Even the back is plastic, it has some shiny finish that looks gr8 for this price range.
( Opal black vll be good choice )

Performance:
I am using this phone for last 2 days..Until now it performs very well ,very good ram management, no hanging issues or anything.
Very smooth performance..

Camera:
Picture quality doesn't look like 48mp but it shot very good snaps.
Most of the people saying poor camera blah blah..Don't mind them...
What we pay is what we get..It is definitely worth for the money we paid.

Overall
This is one of the best phone with such a huge battery in mid range segment.
Battery backup is really good.Also don't compare with realme , Redmi etc. Whatever specs those people give,  Samsung stands out..
Because brand name always matters.

Super amoled screen , 6000mah battery , Triple camera , Super slow motion ...Just Wow

Just go for it without thinking

My major reason for purchasing the phone was the battery life. I already own an s8 plus and wanted a 2nd phone as backup in case my main phone's battery dies. I will break the review in 3 parts
Camera:
I tested this phone's camera against s8 plus and the day light pictures are comparable. But the night mode in m30s phone I didn't find of much value as the images were pixelated. Also the pro mode doesn't have option for change in aperture mode which makes the pro mode of little value. The wide angle camera though gives a reason to use this phone for photography against s8 plus.

Screen:
Screen is as bright as s8 plus

Battery:
I had fully charged the phone to 100 percent at 2200 hrs yesterday and my current battery is showing as 75 percent at 2203 hrs.

I was confused between this phone and Nokia 8.1 but went ahead with this because of past experience with Samsung. I would surely recommend this phone to anyone buying this phone for normal usage and daylight photography.

Hope this review might help you.

Edit 1
This phone takes good pictures subject to using the camera in 3:4 mode. I am attaching the samples. One in daylight and other during night.

I would like to divide this review in Pros and Cons first, then I will discuss more in details.
Pros:
1. Battery Life
2. Screen Quality
3. Software (One UI)
Cons:
1. Camera (will explain later)
2. Fingerprint Sensor
3. Build quality

Now, coming to the detailed review, first I would like to clarify something, that neither the cons are unacceptable defects or something like that, nor the pros are so good that they can beat iPhone 11 pro. So, whatever I am writing here is totally according to my perspective and your point of view/experience may vary.
Coming to the 'pros', the battery in this device is very good. At least for me, where I am coming from iPhone SE, which had terrible battery life. It lasts for 1 day, with at least 30-40% left with moderate usages. I don't play games, what I use it for is e-mail and lots of YouTube streaming. The Screen quality in this device is also very good! it's bright and vivid. Lastly, the UI of Samsung is also very good. I used to be a stock Android guy, then I used iOS for a couple of years, and now after switching to Android again, I find One UI from Samsung very familiar and easy to navigate. Stock Android has become more unpolished and complicated that what it used to be (my opinion).
Now, the cons of this phone need some detailed discussion. First, the camera on this phone is average at max. It doesn't feel like a 42 MP sensor. The pictures it takes do not have the sharpness that you'd expect. The post-processing is aggressive, and the dynamic range it applies to the shot is too much for me. The wide-angle lens is a great feature to have, even though its quality is compromised, I am using the wide mode more often than the normal lens. The shots produced by the wide lens is soft and the dynamic range is very poor in relatively low light conditions. Coming to the depth sensor, I don't use this 'BG Blur' feature at all;  so I am not the right person to say anything about it. What I know is, till date, no matter how good the live focus is, it can't replace a prime lens of a DSLR. They look too artificial for me to use. The front camera is average as well. The photo it takes is softer than I expected and the beautification is horrible. People need to turn it off as soon as possible. the wide mode in selfie camera is useful though. One thing I would like to mention; don't ever use the super steady mode in video. It's too soft and unusable.
Coming to the build quality, the phone is heavy. The weight is well distributed though. The back is plastic and lacks a good finish. It feels cheap. And the fingerprint sensor, which is located on the back is responsive but a bit slow. It also fails to recognise my finger some times.

The processor on this phone is good I guess. I don't play games and for day to day usages, it feels snappy. I have experienced some lags, but I think this much lag is inherent in every android device irrespective of its configuration.

Overall, the phone is good. It's definitely the best Samsung in this price range, and you can't really complain considering its price. I will prefer Samsung over any Chinese brands because I don't like their UI and also do not trust their policies. So, if you got 15K in your hand and you need a phone, you can definitely buy it.

The phone is amazing. The amoled screen is the best part. Battery is superb, runs 13-14 hours screen time with regular Internet activity. The camera is a let down, especially the front camera. Back camera is good but front camera is pathetic. The selfies are cartoon like with low quality. One feature that's missing is there's no option of dual apps, except WhatsApp and Facebook messenger. A good phone with great screen and battery life but camera is a let down.

I am not that happy with samsung galaxy m30s...the camera quality isnt that great for a 48 mega pixel cam and the front cam is worse than any regular smart phone...honestly i had a lot of expectations and i was very excited about the camera which is said to be 48mega pixels but i am very dissapointed....the body is made of plastic..not metal and i m someone clumsy whose mobile kisses the floor almost everytime and i did not know this information so its my fault for not researching about it...but the touch quality and fingerprint sensors are not that great either u need to try 2 times before the fringer print option works...i miss my vivo phone already...it had best feather touch and finger print quality.
I wudnt recomend this mobile to anyone...we can get better mobiles at same rate...very dissapointed in samsung. There is a picture attached taken from m30s which if u zoom enough u can see its not clear even tho i have focused on it. Only good thing about this is battery life its good and the design is great to look.

Best phone in the segment.(for the price)
Let's  break it down.
1)Display
The phone's display is the best in the segment.You get an amoled full HD display which looks super stunning with different screen calibration modes to suit your needs.
2)screen
The screen is of 6.4 inches with minimal bezels at the top and bottom. You also a get a notch at the top which is now standard for most of the phone's.
3) performance
This phone comes with a exynos 9611 1.7hz octa core processor  and 4/6GB of ram with 64gb/128gb of storage.
I have the 64 GB variant and for day to day usage the phone performs well.I did try some games which also run smoothly on this device with minor frame drops here and there.So as of right now I haven't  faced any issues as far as the performance goes.
4) battery
The battery on this phone is a mammoth  6000mah which is the best thing about this device! You can easily get a day out with this device even with a medium to heavy usage.
5) software
This phones comes with the Samsung's  new one ui which is also really good for big phones like this. You can use your phone phone with one hand because of one ui. You do get some bloatware  but you can remove almost all of it easily.
6) camera
This phone comes with a triple camera setup where one is a regular camera which is of 48 megapixels which is a nice thing to have plus you have a wide angle lens(which is again super good to have) and lastly  a depth sensor for portrait.
As far as the photos are concerned  they come out pretty well in normal lighting  conditions and even in home lights.
The wide angle camera is again a plus point.
The front camera is also okay!

Also you get a HEADPHONE JACK!
______
Lastly I would say that this phone is killer deal for the price.Also it's samsung so you don't have to worry about the after sales service!

So far the phone is working great and I am really looking forward to see how this performs!

After a lengthy use.. no heating( after 5 hrs continues use- surfing, calls, video, games and charging), no lag, fast processing, feels premium, 1.9gb ram available, 50 gb storage available, fast charging, feels light weight, sound output is good, music output to BT device is good.
Display- seems yellowish which is with all brands phone (but good for eyes).. and colors saturated not natural which i don't like. Youtube i need to adjust the video view pixels all the time.
Camera- 48mp is for natural setting like u will get good pics but need to have a good and bright light.. then the pics are sharp and justified the camera( flash is auto).. for low light conditions downgrade to lower settings with flash a must..and it satisfy the feel. Slow motion works good and video too.
Using Sennheiser CX 180 and it feels good as music output.

Its a really great phone at this price but the camera is lacking in quality of photos. Low light photos and night mode are good. Gorilla glass is missing so a screen guard is must. Battery is great and there is absolutely no performance lag so far in my use.
If you are ok with an average camera, this is a great phone at this price range.

Update: Reduced the rating. After using the phone for few months, there was a regular auto update which i tried. The phone has hung up ever since at the start up samsung logo indefinitely. Not able to use it. For such a otherwise great phone, its not at all reliable. Thankfully I had not yet disposed of my previous cellphone. As the issue happened just before the lockdown, its been two months that i havent been able to use it. Called samsung support but they are saying that it needs to be physically checked at the service center. Can't believe a regular and simple thing as an auto update can wreck a phone. Hence reduced rating. If it doesn't even start up, what good are all the features !!

I am not happy at all as the battery is not at all giving any backup  as promise. 6000mah sounds good but it lasts only a day..and I dont have any heavy game and run only fb, YouTube and Instagram. I even tried optimizing yet the backup is not more than a day. Wrong promise from Samsung. Camera is good, with 8GB ram performance of the device is not at all that good. I have used this mobile for 2 months now..and for the price the performance is bad..

Writing the review after a couple of weeks of usage. The camera quality is okay-ish, super slow-mo &amp; slow-mo flickers in artificial light. Fingerprint reader &amp; face recognition is average. I'd a huge expectation from the battery backup but it turned out it ain't that great, barely lasts for 1½ days after continuous usage (which in my case is mostly watching movies on different applications which involves internet usage). A 15W charger for this huge battery takes up almost 2hours to get it fully charged. No complain about the display.

First of all,thanks to Samsung  to bring such a phone equipped with monster battery with a good price tag.
Every phone has some pros and cons  and so on same with the M30s.
promising points:-
# BATTERY is the catching point while buying this phone,everyone wants their phone last long with heavy usage as well
#FHD plus display unquestionably best in the market
# camera is descent
Need improvements factor:-
#personally I am not happy with the speaker output,while listening  online songs...its more disappointing so sound is must improving factor
#fingerprint reader also not accurate all the time,response time is not quick
#camera could be more better,the portrait mode or live focus makes photo over saturate so there is missing of natural effect or true color effect.
Verdict:-
Overall it's good value for money phone and could be better with improved camera ,sound and fingerprint  reader quality may be with near future software updates can resolve  the issue if Samsung takes it seriously

It's a good smartphone afterall but the only things which concerns me is the build quality and camera, the phone back is awful like its just like bloated plastic and  jesus the ugly camera area, it doesn't look good from back and camera i thought it was going to be good as they told us but it's mediocre  and but performance wise it's a monster no doubt  but end of the day you are paying 13999(12999) i got 1000₹ cashback so i guess it does worth that much of money

☆Fingerprint Sensor- It is accurate and can be used for scrolling the notification panel as well
☆Display- Awesome! Just Love it!
☆Looks- Sharp &amp; Classy! The color and edges are great. The blue and green combination on the back is classy
☆Performance- Have not played any games as yet. But for daily use the RAM is good and no lags seen uptill now
☆Feels really good in the hand while using

▪︎Battery- It is not as good as 6000mAh. Feels more like 4000mAh.
▪︎Camera- Quality does not look like 48MP but, the photos clicked are really nice. Ultra wide mode covers lot more than expected.

OverallI would say it is a great buy at 15k (with discount)

For first time I am using Samsung Mobile and it is awesome. I have used Lenovo, HTC, Nokia,  Redmi, Realme, Vivo. But in this price category it is the smoothest mobile I have ever used. Camera is just awesome as I have to capture photos of big ledgers books, it takes the photo easily. Picture quality is very good. The AI mode is also better than other phones.
Battery backup is awesome, if I close auto syn, GPS and use the power saver mode then only 10 to 15% battery consumed, in office hours(9am to 7pm). I make like 10 calls. Played like 1hour and with Facebook, WhatsApp, use hotspot for 4 to 5 hours, with always on display.
Built quality awesome.
It lack in sound quality but no complain as today we all use the bluetooth speaker or headphone.
Screen touch is very good I have played many high quality games in all the other mobiles I brought but the smoothness is best in this mobile.
Processor quality is very good, I don't understand why everyone says Exynox is lagging behind Qualcomm.
I don't know how other reviewers get the framerate in a game, but I played COD yesterday it's very good than the other mobile  I have been with.
And last the SAmoled screen is awesome.  As it not reflect any light when I using dark mode. The black is totally black no lights. And the full brightness we can look at the mobile under sunlight, other mobile have that feature but not that good.
But it lags in signal quality. The fingerprint unlock is slow due to animation but it is now thing of past after update recently.
And the face unlock is also slow due to animation. But it is good to have slow face unlock, if I have to watch the time it doesn't unlock as today we don't use watch anymore.
I can't compare it to other mobiles who were more pricey and have large storage. But 64 GB is more than enough.
In this price range I am sure that it's best anyone can get.
And guys who are still buying old iPhones buy this one you never regret. It is way faster and bigger and smoother than i6 or i7 series mobile.

It is not up to the mark. Bar and quality  is poor. Battery also getting  dead. Battery rated one as it's not allowing  to submit review without  star rating. Forcefully need to rate to submit  feedback. Amazon is not helping  customer.  They are only guiding with troubleshooting and terms and conditions.  This was not expected from Amazon. Now onwards won't buy any electronics and Mobile products from amazon. I stopped  using another well known  site due to same reason and switched  to amazon. But here also same issue. It's better to go for offline  buy. No headset no screen guard. Offer is not beneficial.  In offline  purchase we can have all this things. Very disappointed  with this phone
Samsung Galaxy M30s (Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage).
Worst quality of phone and no cooperation from amazon. Star rating worst worst worst !!!

I am skeptic student with little more than average usage and was confused between realme 5 pro and this. I won't use this device for moderate gaming but little over general use. Ultimetely I ordered Black 4+64 variant because it was the best I could get for 11600(amzn cashback 1k+sbi 1.6k). I got this product from STPL seller on 2-oct.. It's been 26 days since I am using this(without cover or screen protector because I am lazy thay way :P.)
I would go from cons to pros-
C1:The people who only look at body colour will be  disappointed because its not all flashing like the chinese counterparts.
C2:The back is little cheaped, plastic body..And yes there is a problem of clicking sound(which is when u press the edges.(observed in almost all veriants). The back got hair scratches(despite my extreme care) and are visible when viewed in an angle with direct light. There is a thin hair gap between the unibody and screen
C3: For UI: The Double tap to wake is little slow. Someone who is switching from stock android may take some time to get used to Camera app,, Using, Editing home screen, Samsung's device management app.
C4: After watching phone throwing reviews on youtube....the display will die from 3 ft. fall even if tempered is used( as the screen won't shatter but panel beneath it will)
C5:The speaker volume changes massively between 80 to 100%(feels like a change from 60 to 100%)..possibly an update will fix that
C6:This may depend on user to user, but, the keyboard needs a little update on touch mapping....even google keyboard is short hieghted.
....I won't call these a Cons or Pros but
A)wont expect a case, tempered or long usb cable.
B)while playing PUBG(the only game I tested) in Smooth, Ultra FPS., it performed great but got pretty hot in the top region so i dialed it back to medium after few sessions..Played for 4 hours straight from 78% to 30%. The ping on jio was 60 to 80 while playing..
Besides Exynos 9611 goes on par with Snap.712 on paper... I felt 9611 on a little lower side.
C)The sim tray is difficult to remove(it is stiff). Won't recommended for people switching sim cards regularly.
For pros i have
P1: The USP: The battery can't be compared to anything(and i include my speaker, earphones and even lapy)....I charge it till 80 in the morning, and return with 50+ in the evening..given I don't game but Cell signals fluctuate between 0 to 80% signal, have average use and exploit college WiFi :D.
P2: All of my friends lauded the display. And it is really good..despite the low price...
P3: Samsung UI is not at all annoying..despite stock is the best...got used to it within 3 days...And I just love the Dark(A.K.A. Night) Mode.....Using it since first day. The gestures work nicely.
P4:Despite massive battery the phone did not felt thick or bulky on the first touch and is not annoying in pant pockets.
P5:Despite criticism on Exynos budget lineup...9611 does a great job...till now..no hangs, crashes(in any app) or any anomaly observed...the screen transitions from home to apps or vice versa is good, and home button works instantly.

-Won't describe camera quality as youtubers have done pretty good job..

Note: While looking for a phone I was only looking for a good processor, atleast 64 gb storage, display(atleast 1080),3.5mm jack and no frills(mainly adware) android...
And i wouldn't care if the phone did not had back or selfie camera(i mean literally if they did not exist), average battery capacity, attractive colours..

Bottomline- For 11600 I got a great phone.. And this phone would be perfect for all non or light gamers/parents....The build quality restricts it from little careless users...The stock UI features are good for almost all people (excluding users who would root and/or install custom ROMs and probably don't care about the stock UI :P)

Pros: At the cost i bought the phones(exchange+ cashback+discount), i guess I got myself a steal deal. Could not have asked for more than this.

1. Nice camera ( its better than average for sure but that superior). The wide angle is amazing and so are the slow mo and super slow mo. Camera also comes with AR emotions. ( I know nobody really cares on details but i love the camera with different mode options)
2. Nice Built and Sturdy
3. 6000 battery is nice and cool thing to have.
4. Phone is fast no laggs.
5. I did a game spree for 4 hours. No heating issues no laggs and battery was still at more than 50%

Cons:
1. I feel the phone is heavy. Could be due to battery but is heavy.
2. Fast charger is there but still needs around 1+hr to charge.
3. Samsung new UI and them ( i personally  do not like the new UI. similar colour and icon makes it confusing)
4. No headphone in the box and no back cover.

Been usjng it from past 3 months. Device feels a bit heavy(due to 6000mah battery),screen quality and resolution is awesome,audio quality is also very good. I get an average of 7 hours screen on time in 1 full charge. You get a fast charger as well. There are no lags or frame drops(haven't used for gaming). One UI feels much lighter and simple to use. Though there are few pre-installed apps, they can be uninstalled. 6gb ram is more than enough to handle day to day tasks. Overall there is nothing to complain about the product for its asking price. Worth every penny..its a beast in its own terms..!!!

I expected much from this mobile. Got Android Pie with One UI 1.5 along with adaptive fast charging adaptor out of the box. Let me share with you my experience;

PROS;
✓✓ Display is Super AMOLED, outdoor display brightness is better than M30,
✓✓ Ultra-wide camera is improved and captures 123 degree
✓✓ Battery is bigger enough to be compared with a battery of MacBook Pro,
✓✓ Phone is lightweight as 188gm while holding a bigger battery with capacity of 6000mAh,
✓✓ Triple camera setup includes a 48mp Samsung GM1 sensor, an 8mp ultra wide angle lens and a 5mp depth. Front camera is also 16mp,
✓✓ It does not have EIS but Super Steady mode is impressive. It can record 4K videos, Super Slow-Mo and Hyper lapse,
✓✓ Type-C port along with a 3.5mm headphone jack provided,
✓✓ Exynos 9611 octa-core chipset based on a 10nm process. Same processor has been used on Samsung A50S which is being sold at higher price by same brand. Performance is smooth and competent for playing games because Exynos 9611 is better than the Snapdragon 665 as per my experience,

CONS;
✓✓ Body is made of plastic which makes it quality inferior and does not give it a premium look like other Samsung phones,
✓✓ Front screen and Back glass are not protected like Corning Gorrila Glass so beware of losing it. (If you have enrolled for Amazon 1 year screen replacement program then fine otherwise AMOLED display replacement can cost you minimum Rs.6k)
✓✓ Processor is power consuming and Battery performance is not upto expectation, even its same almost like M30 as I compared with my brothers phone,
✓✓ 15W fast charging is slow for this giant battery,
✓✓ Small size apertures (48mp cam with an f/2.0 aperture, 5mp with an f/2.2 and 8mp with f/2.2.) capture less light through it. Result average night mode and less blurred bokeh,
✓✓ Front cam selfie lack detailing and seems smoother and Super steady mode does not work on it,
✓✓ No inscreen fingerprint sensor like Mi A3 which is earlier launched in lower range,
✓✓ NFC is no future technology and missing it in a latest phone does make it lack at some point
✓✓ Face unlock is not faster and effective
✓✓ Slo-mo video Flickers in artificial lightening

Final verdict;
As per my experience if you want to stuck with Samsung then you can go for Samsung M30 which will give you better battery backup with lighter weight and less mAh and better image quality in lesser megapixels and bigger Aperture.
And if you can go with another brand then get Mi nore 8 pro with slomo at 960fps, 64mp quadcam and Built in Alexa.

Review after 10 day use

Call Quality:
Call quality is good. No call drops till now even where signal is poor.

Screen:
Screen quality is awesome. Always on display also looks good.

Built Quality:
Built quality could have been better. Over all not too big, even though it houses a big screen. Feels comfortable in hand.
Not very heavy. An extra front and back protection is advisable.

UI:
Loving the pop up view for apps.
One UI is great.Did not experience any lags. But the phone does take some time to boot up.
Users can find all needed settings easily. Less required settings are nicely tucked at the bottom of every section.
Black mode looks great on this screen. Few third party applications can be un-installed and others do not have that option.
Would have been better if Internet speed gets displayed on the top of the screen. Not able to know if any application is consuming data in the background. Will check further if any such option is available.

Camera:
Great within the price segment.
If photo is taken in live focus mode, then you can change the background effect after the photo has been taken.
Live focus mode works if subject is within 1.5 meter.
Photo taken using Night mode look good but on slight zooming pixels show up. Night mode does not work for wide angle photos.
Front camera can shoot in pitch darkness. The screen acts as the flash.
Have checked all photos in phone display. Need to check after transfering to the computer.

Gaming:
Works fine. No hiccups till now. GAme launcher can have some features like screen recording which is missing.

Media:
Music is great. Dolby Atmos is great but works only when headphones are plugged in.
Videos look great. The notch does not obstruct your view. The video can be scaled up to fill the complete screen, but then certain section of the video might get cropped. Tested with only Youtube. Will check other applications as well.

Thanks to the 6000mah battery, used the phone for 1.5 days and still had 30% battery left.

This is my review of the phone after 4 days of continuous usage. Samsung phones are always reliable. And when I saw the 6000 mAH Battery, just then i decided to buy the monster as battery is what I required the most. I am too lazy to keep charging the phone again and again.  So guys here are the list of pros and cons for you to get an honest overview of the phone..

1. Battery- I fully charged my phone on 30th September for the first time in the night at 8:00 PM. It takes around 2 hours to fully charge from 5% to 100%. After that I put my phone for charging again on 02nd October at 2:00 PM.  I watched 05 episodes of Troy on netflix, played games and browsed the Internet. So it gave a solid battery backup of 42 hours on moderate usage.

2. Display-Display is awesome and watching videos and pictures is so amazing on this phone as you can hide the navigation bar and enjoy full screen videos.

Camera: There have been various picture modes and video modes which allow you to capture moments very EASILY and with variety of effects. Also, the night mode is really amazing. I like the selfie cam more than the rear one.

4. Back cover- Although its slippery and made up of plastic, if you are going to use a transparent back cover, people are going to be jealous of your phone. Its quite beautiful and the camera's are aligned beautifully and amplify the beauty of phone.

I would rate the phone 9 out of 10. In its price range, the phone does not disappoints.

As a complete package its definately one good deal which you cant skip
Battery - lasts nearly 2 days on normal usage. Charging is fast but it is advisable not to charge over 80 percent.
Camera= all good with 48 mp cam sensor however if we compare with sony imx 586 sensor the sony wins by a small margin, that said the cam is good, video shooting is good in day light however true potential lies in pro mode, and id possible get the Gcam app if possible.
Screen= great screen, samsung makes beautiful screens and at this price you sure get the best
Processor= its very good however honestly i have not played any games here as i strictly use this device for office use and snapping pics and those pics end up in my web page and advertisemnts.
Charging= modern USB C charging, plug it in without having to worry about wrong side going in.
Drop test= i have accidentally deopped this device twice from waist hight and nothing happend , what a relief and i guess its Corning gorilla 3 here.
Samsung= has a very nice RAM management under Digital welbeing in the system menue.
OS is android 9 out of the box. Good. Slightly heavy mask as compared to stock android. Samsung please make the OS skin lighter or near stock and please give GCam app option.
Keyboard = cant figure how to get google keyboard , only seeing samsung keyboard. Need google hindi keyboard. Cant figure how to increase spacing between keys.
Scanner= at the back of the phone and way better than screen scanner.
Face scanner is cool. No complains here.

Missing stuff
No ear phones in the box, however earphone jack is still there so thats a positive
Expectations=
Samsung please get one handset with stock android. Just one. And waiting for 64Mp isocell sensors in this budget for next year

I have been using this mobile for more than 5 days , I'll give my honest review
CAMERA :The company claims it to be 48 MP but my brothers realme 3 pro's images are better.
BATTERY : Guys don't be fooled by thinking it has a massive 6000 MAH battery , the backup is not up to the mark , and it takes 2.45 - 3.15 hours to charge
DISPLAY : Maybe the only great thing in this phone
GAMING : plays PUBG in HD , HIGH , not not as smooth as a phone with Snapdragon 710
CALL QUALITY : I don't know why many YouTube reviewers mention it, it appears to be the same in mostly all new devices , but there is one issue on this device guys , as the mobile heats up or ( background downloading , picking up a call in a middle of a game ) it becomes almost impossible to keep the mobile near the ear as the heat is very high .
.
My advice , buy this mobile if u want a mobile with good brand value or else please save your money.

Great mobile
Battery is awesome
Camera Quality is also great
Fingerprint is Decent
Display is just awesome
Pubg runs Great with smooth + extrene
Also supports Hdr settings but I think we need to play pubg in HD  for higher graphics and lag free experience

I'm going to review it after 20 days,so I capture everything in this review, hope it will help you to find best one

6000mah
battery really a giant because before this phone I was user of IPHONE5S so I used to carry a power bank with me anywhere but when I got this phone,Trust me not even a single day I used my power bank but camera is an average.

Samsung state that they are giving 48MP rear camera but genuinely you can get far better picture in 8MP camera of an iPhone.Rear camera is good

Speed of this phone is also impressive because 6GB ram is enough to go for the super speed and this phone is perfect.

Shape of the phone is same as previous M30 and many s series.Little more heavier than mi phone and iPhones. I don't like the design of Samsung bcz thick sides are not look good.

Touch and sounds are amazing,you can feel the smoothness

In this price it's a best option  but you have to compromise with camera.

I attached some clicks, so please see for more clarity about camera.I used pro mode,Wide angle and normal angle.

Fully satisfied with M30S. Based on my usage of 3 days, I would like to review as below.

Pro : -
10/10 Excellent Display
10/10 Outstanding Battery backup - truly Monster
10/10 Smooth operating experience. No lags in One-UI.
10/10 No heating even after continuous YouTube of 5Hrs.
10/10 Variety of  functionalities given. Thumbs up for it.
10/10 Good Look and decent hand grip...
8/10 Build quality is ok.
8/10 Camera performance is ok . Not up to 48 MP. But ok. Good features given in camera especially for video.
10/10 Face unlock, finger print scanner works excellent.

Cons: (can be because of my view)
No cover provided in box.
No handsfree.
Build quality seems weak due to plastic build. But all these can be avoided when we see Samsung Brand and discount offers on Amazon.

Worst camera result
Onpaper samsung says 48MP but actual camera result is like nokia's 5PM camera
Poor display quality
Battery backup is like 3000mah
Heating problem
Network IC of this device is very poor.
Totally cheating by Samsung
Please Don't buy this product
Both camera are very very very poor

AMAZON sent it in two days.  128GB opal black . Looks  really  nice. But feels cheap. Samsung is a well known OEM. I never use samsung before. As they febricate their own processor, memory, display etc, I thought it will be better. The proven disappointment are in below.
Pros:
6000mAh battery (though it's not real) and 15 watt 'fast charger' charge my phone from 10% to 100% in 2Hr40min.

Cons:
1. camera works average in sunny day(my redmi note 4 took better photos.), useless wide angle (better to use panorama). Super useless  night mode (again redmi note 4 with g-cam took  way better  photos  in night). Color correction  in daylight  is somewhat good but at artificial  lighting  conditions it sucks.
2. Gaming.  Expected disappointment as usual from Samsung.
3. Slow finger print sensor. Some time it don't work.
4. Yellowish screen. The white tone changes when  u see the screen  from side angle.
5. Low speaker output. And bad speaker  sounds quality during call.
6. Small data cable.. and cheap quality.
7. At least  a pre-applied screen  protector  should be there or a silicon case.
8. Draws 7% power in one hour in ideal mode when the data is active with no app in app drawer.
9. Problem with adaptive brightness control.
10. Buggy compass sensor, need frequent calibration during navigation.
11. Low signal reception.

For better phone in same price go for realme xt or 5 pro or poco f1,

or wait  for redmi note  8pro.

Samsung is fooling customers by selling 48mp camera. Camera has worst performance. Details are not captured, on 48mp mode after you zoom a little bit it's all grain and distorted. I think this lens 48mp lens is not of sony. Just to sell there product samsung is fooling people. Not expected from such big brand. I feel trapped now by spending another 2k I could have bought 8pro, or xt or realme5pro. Samsung is clear cheat. Guys plz comment if u agree or no.

Its great.. obviously it have the features it says.. but it does have some cons.. :
*Camera Not Upto The Mark. Front camera is not that good...
*Processor not that good for high graphic games. it lags sometimes..
Like PUBG and CallOfDuty
*Have a greater chance of getting its screen damaged... coz of its Dimensions.
#This is it... that's all I found until now.. the rest is awesome #

Been using for a few weeks, and loving the phone so far.

Pros:
1) Excellent display - love the edgeless screen design.
2) Slim &amp; comfortable to handle / type one-handed (I use a Swype keyboard).
3) Camera does very well in varying light conditions. Auto setting &amp; smart shot guide will get you great pictures 9 of 10 times. Image quality isn't too bad even at high zoom.
4) BATTERY LIFE! Best I've ever seen. Phone still has 5-10% charge after full day (10-12 hours) of constant use, including having GPS, WiFi, hotspot, or Bluetooth on for long stretches, plus playing audio or videos, plus constant browsing &amp; texts. Really lives up to the advertising here. (Also, the "fast charging" is really fast. 50% to 90%+ in an hour.)
5. Inbuilt ability to set up dual accounts (e.g. on WhatsApp) is great for a dual SIM phone. Had struggled to get this to work on earlier Android models. Totally smooth &amp; easy here.

Cons:
1. Sound quality is so-so. Not bad, but you're much better off pairing with a good set of headphones or a Bluetooth speaker for anything beyond basic calling.
2. Touchscreen sensitivity suffers if you're using a screen protector. There is a setting to enhance this, but still a bit slow at times.
3. No "knock to unlock" feature. Have to use the lock/power button each time.
4. With volume &amp; power buttons on the same side, it's hard to take a screenshot one-handed.

Overall 4.5 stars. Battery life makes it totally worth the price.

I have purchased Samsung Galaxy M30S a month before.There are some pros and cons points in this phone .
1.Slow motion and ultra slow motion video you can make in this phone
2.Good battery back up
3.Video display quality is good
4.super touch screen
5.Fast charging features also good,u don't feel for 6000mAH battery

Cons:
1.One day i received a call at that time I search the contacts list and it was hanged.Further I opened the contacts the name shows like in floating window screen. After restart the phone,it worked.
2.Battery consumption is little bit high using camera, capturing continuous pictures.
3.Immediate auto sensor for screen brightness not working.
4.Plastic body there may be chance of damage screen, so cover should always provide.

Overall best phone in the mid range users, efficiently use and take the advantage.😘✌

Samsung best mobile phone under 15k price.
6000mAh battery will last for around 2 days or at least 1 and half day.

It has a sAMOLED display so definitely you cannot find any flaw in display quality there.

Samsung's one UI is awesome, I haven't used the one UI before this but now a fan of it. Feels better than the stock android.

Been using this constantly and till now haven't recieved any heating issue , ya it does get heated a bit while on charging but every mobile that has a fast charging support gets heated up and it's not a flaw.

Face unlock is fast it detects your face even in the dark. And fingerprint is also very fast.

Not really tested the camera yet but yes whatever I've noticed with that i can say that it's not so good when it comes to making videos in indoor lighting in outdoor lighting camera really performs well.

Overall a good product in mid range.

If you want to forget when you last charged your phone then this is for you.
Pros-
Good battery backup around 2 and half days
Gaming-you can play almost any game without any lag issues
Top Features at no cost- fingerprint sensor, 4 GB ram, dual 4g sim, face unlock, display, big battery

Cons-
fingerprint sensor sometimes forgets to recognize the fingers
Plastic back gets discolored in couple of months,better use back cover
Camera- although with triple camera the phone doesn't take that good quality pictures
Sound quality- somehow I feel that the music quality on the phone is not good enough

Purchased this phone on great Indian sale.I got this WITH 11600 INR.

MY OBSERVATIONS:
1. BATTERY LIFE is EXCELLENT.
2. CAMERA IS WELL NORMALLY ,BUT THIS CAMERA SHOWS REMOTE OBJECTS IN MUCH MORE ZOOMED OUT MODE DUE TO WHICH
WHEN U ZOOM JN LITTLE IT BURSTS OUT AND PICTURE QUALITY TURNS BAD. FOR OBJECTS NEARBY THE CAMERA IS GOOD.
3. HEATING ISSUE IS OBSERVED WHILE CALLING.
4. WHEN YOU TALK WITH SOMEONE, IT'S AUDIBLE TO EVERYONE NEAR YOU....THIS IS DEFINITELY A NEGATIVE POINT......IN REDMI PHONES U WON'T FIND SUCH ISSUE.MAY BE DUE TO METAL COVER IN REDMI SOUND NEVER LEAKS OUT TO FROM BACK SIDE.
5. PERFORMANCE IS WELL AND GOOD...... BUT I HV EXPERIENCED CRASH IN DIFFERENT APP FOR THE SAME BUILDS WORKING PROPERLY IN OTHER PHONES.
6. THE PART OF THIS PHONE IS AMOLED SCREEN...... THIS IS TRUELY AMAZING.ALSO THE BATTERY.
7. AND MUST USE A HARD CASE AS SAMSUNG'S PHONE/SCREEN BREAKS EASILY.
8 Samsung special ui is also great.

OVERALL I WOULD RECOMMEND TO PURCHASE THE 6 GB VERSION FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE.

It's not a long durable device as it's started hanging within few week.....This is my personal observation.

Thank you.

I am using since last two months, it's little slow comparing to mi series phones. Fingerprint sensor is slow. Phone hangs up frequently. When video calling rear camera is completely hazy. In still photography also lens adjustment takes a long time than usual and accuracy is not there. In coming calls displays late rings fast at least 2-3 seconds. Only limited dual apps. Earlier I was using mi note three with 4000 mah battery,  it seems to me that 4000 mah battery is more capable than this 6000mah. No screenshot option in drop down. You have to press side keys and that is problematic. Clear voice quality, display also nice. I switched on this phone half an hour ago  after full charge and now it is 92%. The discharging rate is too fast. Overall a moderate phone.

Amazing phone..... Am writing this review after using it for 4 months... Am not an technical guy... I'll just write from my prospective.
Pros
1- Battery battery and battery.... 6000mah huge battery easily comes full day for me with just one charge
2- super amoled display.... One of the best displays... Amazing
3- SAR between 0.3 to 0.4.... This was the most important thing to me.... It's one of the phone with lowest radiation level(if u wanna stay away from some diseases and keep ur sperm count better then better go with this phone😁😁)

Cons
1 - Sometimes, very rarely call gets hanged on receiving (Don't know it's my network or phones prob)
2- camera not that great especially in night mode

This is all I could think off... Thank you.

I am a person who believes that  phones costing more than 15k aren't going to give you a good ROI ever. With the pace of technological advancements any phone older than 2yrs is outdated and is no fun to use anymore. I wasn't a Samsung fan earlier, also because I think there wasn't a very good phone in that space.
M30s is a phone which offers everything needed from a good smart phone. Amazing  camera performance, a very good selfie camera as well. Battery capacity is the most important factor when looking for a good phone, and this phone outperforms  every other in this category. The processor is also very fast, I felt the apps performance  very fast compared to other devices. The screen resolution is also brilliant.

There's a feeling of contentment when you hold the phone, coz you've got all in one at this price point. The touch is just spot on. Fingers glide so effortlessly. Its like skin. And might I say about the sAMOLED screen, the graphics looks so divine,the colours, sharpness...its a feast for the eyes. The screen size and built, despite being a plastic back, looks premium. No hangups, faster loading and hassle free performance. Therez just so more to discover in it's features. This was my upgrade from my Moto E3 power. So I could definitely feel the difference.....plus I don't have to carry my charger to the office anymore. In addition...the Camera pics are sharp and colorful.

I received the phone yesterday. It is a review after 24 hrs. I didn't  use it from 9.30 PM to 9.30 am.
Pros;
  Excellent display,
  Excellent UI
  Good processor ( never experienced a lag)
  Good  camera  ( though it struggles  in
  low light.)
  Good call reception
  Nice audio experience on earphone, when
  Dolby atmos is on.
  Low SAR value.
Cons,
  Battery life (without playing  any game,
  I got one day of life
  from 100 percentage
  charged one.)
  Mobile signal  reception  is average.
The phone's overall performance is good. It is nice to use. I glad to recommend this for someone.

I just picked Samsung M30s and I'm so far  happy with this call.First of all am in love with the sapphire blue look....
Talking about this phone, this comes with great battery life and I can strem all my favourite songs,videos and play games without worrying that it may go off. The camera is very good, captures great pics both in day and night. The storage capacity is not a worry either, thanks to the 128GB varient.
The display is really very good. Everything so bright and nice. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I'm loving it! :)

Can't go wrong when it comes to picking Samsung. You get a great phone. Nothing to complain in terms of features except that, despite being 48 MP, the camera is decent. The camera of previous models is much better.
What I was disappointed with is the packaging. Poor material quality (box, charger and cable - not the kind of quality you generally get with Samsung). They are promoting the idea of Make In India so I'm assuming that is why the quality is low. Had the same phone been manufactured in Vietnam/China (as usual) there would be far better quality offered. I know that it's a budget phone but competitor brands offer way better packaging and accessory quality at the same price range.
The cable charging is normal, no different from previous generations of Samsung phones.

It is worse mobile as it heats continuously and creating pain in head during call. When consulted Samsung, they said to check in safe mode. It was persisting in safe mode too. When I tried returning the item, Amazon denied saying it cannot be returned but only replaced with similar item after am having some test through blancco app. The app measures temp as 35 deg max but believe me it is very hot and emanates radiation while calling. I am a sufferer and nobody is listening.
This phone is a big disappointment for those who crave for aesthetics!
Its a bulky phone and very thick and not so comfortable in hand...and a bit heavier too!! I wish it were sleek and lighter.😢

Features are out of the world.. as display, battery, camera and RAM+Storage is incomparably superb. Another lacuna is type C charging cable as it is not universal. Charging is also not so fast. Took more than 2 hours to get 100% charged.

Very nice mobile with superb battery backup. I charged 100% On heavy use of Facebook, Insta, what's app and browsing it comes to 18% after 44hrs. So I think its gr8 battery backup. Photo quality is also good and will not disappoint you. Build quality is good easy to handle, type with a single hand. Fast processing. Its took time for me  to understand the features. charging time 0-100% takes 2 hrs. Over all superb phone. I will recommend this phone with 6GB ram.

As per my experience worst phone in my life. It's network signals are very poor, and it will getting heat while charging and also using games of half an hour.  And samsung not accepting easily to get back the product. Samsung m 30s is worst phone. Where other phone like honored mi phones accessible signals are working properly their samsung m 30s was very very poor. Please think before ones to before purchase this product.

Although I used it for 2 days, overally it is a good purchase, GOOD DISPLAY AND PERFORMANCE, But I COULDN'T RECOGNISE THE 6000 MH BATTERY. It seems to be not more than 5000 Mh Battery. Becuse it lasts little more than 1 day with usual tasks.
better review can come after 1 month use.

Like:
Finger print sensor is super fast, even better then one plus 7. My wife have one plus 7.
3.5 mm audio Jack, I don't know why premium phones are removing this.
Performance is ok, I didn't feel any lag or so. I don't play games.
Dislike:
Camera is biggest disappointment, there is no clarity at all. Don't go with specifications.
Screen resolution is also not good.
This phone is too heavy.
Battery life is normal. I was expecting with monster backup with monster battery. But its almost around 36 hours. That is of one plus 7 too with just 3700mh.

My view: the phone is quite average,  it don't justify specifications.

The best decision  of my life to buy this phone.
Absolute monster in every aspect of day to day life.
1.The best part of the phone is its screen , as we know nowadays says screens are the things which we see most times in our day , so it must be great,
The super amoled screen on this device is the best screen in any phone of this process segment and definitely same as the other samsung flagships.
2.The battery. It works like charm and definitely feels like monster. As I travel daily to my college and it is considerably far, it takes 1.5 hours to reach , I listened  to music and continuously using social media apps and some lite games , my battery drained from 100% to 96% during the journey,  So a huge thumbs up for that.
3.The performance. The most important  thing is brilliant ram management of the phone. The best in the segment . And I played pubg mobile and the newly launched call of duty , I played both in high graphic settings and the performance I was getting was awesome and the frame rates were high all the time.
4.Camera  . The photos were crisp and clear and the ultra wide and the portrait shots look great
BUT the low light images should be improved
5.As a lot of people will be considerate  about the charging time of a massive 6000mah battery, I like to tell you that as a fast 15W charger comes out of the box,i took me 1 hour 50 min to charge the device from 22% to 100% . The normal time a 4000mah phone takes to charge with a 10W charger.
According to my experience of 4 days of usability , I should blindly suggest you to buy this phone.
Now I came to know why samsung is the global leader .
P.S. Huge shoutout to amazon for 12 hour delivery.

Writing this review after one week of usage.

Positives
1.PRICE! This is probably the first time I have seen samsung give so many features at such a low price.
2.6000mah battery! Samsung strikes technical front here with a much needed upgrade since most samsung phones drain out in quick time.
3.Amoled display is top notch.Feels more realistic and you know its samsung by just a glimpse of its display!
4.Camera! I'm a professional photographer and I own a good DSLR.So phone cameras and pixel bindings are not something that can impress me.But trust me ,this one did!Yet again samsung proves what it is capable of when it comes to camera.
4.I have bought a 6,128G variant.Memory management is quite good.
5.UI is the best! Most technically advanced and user friendly interface is to be appreciated and here is where it wins over most android phones in market!

Negatives:
1.2hrs+ charging is always pain when you are in an emergency.Although it reads fast charging on the adapter ,it feels more sarcastic.I can understand ..bigger battery,bigger responsibilities of charging.But after such a technically strong platform this is a slight letdown.
3.Personally I felt the battery still drains faster and even 6000mah is not enough for me.I still need to figure out what's consuming so much of my battery but not satisfied with battery time.

Conclusion: With all the realmes ,redmis,Oppos and Vivos people would definitely have a confusion between Realme XT and M30s.I was really fortunate to use a Realme XT which was one my frnds even before buying M30s.Frankly speaking 64MP camera is great ,better than the m30s but the OS! No ,not upto the mark.If you ask me ,this is phone will probably turn out to be the best device in market in the coming days.I believe in quality and samsung has provided me that! Thanks for showing some patience  and reading this review,hope this helps!

I just got my product on 9th of October 2019 and the product is awesome, except build in cover and camera quality, there is a sound whenever i press kinda hard on the screen and  back of the phone, same happened in brothers mobile phone when he ordered few weeks earlier than me when the phone was just realised

Cons:
●The build in quality is not good.
●Camera pixels get distroyed when you zoom in on a picture and the photo is not that qood.
●The finger should be placed at the correct place to open fingerprint
● battery dies quickly depending on games you play if the games are of 1 gb or more the battery gets drained up quickly

Pros:
•The screen is really good.
• the processing happenes fast and downloading is quick
•the games you download are amazing
To play here.

Overall it is a great phone, worth of product, worth of money and should buy.

I was going for pocco f1 'cause of the price and the things given in the price but the reviews said the phone heats up and all that and samsung is good company i have been using samsung product over a decade now so I choose to buy m30s and only INDIAN SIM card is allowed to put in that means if you are going abroad you cant put any sims

Here are some of the following things that you must know before buying the product:

1.)DISPLAY- The display is fabulous.  Other phones are also providing super amoled but this phone gives extra brightness too making it eye catching.
*use tempered guard and back cover coz the amoled displays are delicate*.

2.)CAMERA- You are just listening about its not 48 MP its just on the papers , its not just like that. See it gives little blurry and grainy image when shot in artificial lighting like in home but when you shot in natural lighting it just gives amazing picks with the great dynamic range. Same with the front camera but it gives little soft and less details when you zoom 3x. I think this problem can be solved by upcoming software updates.

3.) BATTERY- i) If you are a gamer then 18-20 hours of  battery backup.
ii) If you are a normal user then 1.5-2 days  of  battery backup.

4.) PERFORMANCE- amazing performance by Samsung. If you are thinking that Samsung is a hanger company, then you are wrong. Current Samsung mid range phones doesn't hang and it gives a much better user experience than other phones. App just opens in 1-2 seconds in general.

If you are a gamer and want to enjoy heavy games like pubg you have to face some heating issues and minor lags within 10 to 15 minutes.

5.) LOOKS - Doesn't Matter when applying back cover. Rest is upto you.
Overall build quality is good.

If you  are not a heavy gamer i will strongly recommend M30s. It will not disappoint you!!!!

Good phone at this budget. Using this from last 12days
I got the phone 6GB, 128GB for 11k after exchange and other offers
Rear camera quality is good with 48mp and other options also  but saving photo takes 3_4sec in 48mp mode.
Front camera is really good compared other brand 16mp front cameras
Battery life also good , giving around 36hrs on moderate usage with continuous data ON And without gaming .
(But I expected little more battery life)
There is no hanging problem
Night mode is good
Blue light filtration also works good.
Samsung would have gone for on screen fingerprint sensor,  which will definitely add much worth to this phone

Will update after few months

Within a buget of 14k it's one of the best phone one can grab. Battery is good. Camera is also good. Amoled display adds advantage to it against its competitor. I am not a gamer so can't review for gaming purpose. Overall the phone is too smooth. Black one is classy. You might face some porblem in getting screen guard or covers from local market as it's launched very recently. Now lets have a detailed review.

Camera: Though 48 mega pixel is somehow vague for me as the dslr cameras also porvide around 24 mega pixel. But the photo quality if the camera is very good. Low light photos that you get is also good within this budget. Front camera is equally good. Front camera also provides you a little bit of wide angle view.

Battery: It's a jumbo. 6000 mah stands for around 1.5 days with medium usage like little bit of gaming, 18-20 hrs of internet connection tunrned on, social media browsing, bit of a video playback for around 40 mins.

It comes with android pie with both samsungs own ui and prosessor. I felt the processor to be good. It runs quite smoothly. It has night mode dispaly option for lower stress on eyes. Speaker quality is also good and one additional thing u get is the dolby output for earphones. Its a huge advantage and it really makes a difference in output.

Ordered this phone on the day of launch seeing the Specs on paper and without any research on the reviews.. The display is good and so is the battery with fast charging.. Fingerprint and Face unlock are quick.. the biggest let down of this phone is Camera.. the camera even with 3 of them and one of them being 48 Pixels is of no use in indoor photos.. The camera takes you back probably 10 years.. I wanted to return and buy an One Plus, however no returns are allowed.. Stay away from this phone if you are looking for a good camera phone in this price range as there are better options like Redmi Note 7 Pro

6000 mah battery the usp of this mobile is lived up to the expectations. I don't play games. So no idea about battery performance wen u play games like pubg or other high graphics games. For normal usage with calls and with mobile data on for whole time  and frequent wats app check and other social media use. Watching videos for 3 hrs in a day setting. The full charge lasted for two days for me.
Camera - decent and good quality picture for this price range. Low light photography with night mode is above average. Day light photographs are very good and live focus works too good. Other video options like super slowmotion and slow motion steady cam all found very good.u can create pwm emoji ar stickers and other add on which is common in all mobile now days.

Build- plastic body mine was white, yes high chance getting stains of used with out cover or case. Used for two days with out case shiny finish in the back got little dull. So bought case to avoid further damage. So its recommended to buy case. Display very good adaptive brightness helps lot.

Finally you are getting Samsung in this price point with good spec and very good functionality  mobile u should not miss.

Please not I'm using 6GB 118 GB mobile.

Mobile is okay for the price being.
Two major issues:
1. Front camera is very pathetic, acts like 2MP camera.
2. Battery does not act like 6000 mAh or even 5830 mAh as Samsung mentioned as its minimum output.  I don't know whether it is a battery draining issue or marketing gimmick.

I would request Samsung to fix these asap through updates, if detected any software related.

  Thanks.

The phone is an absolute beast in terms of most performance aspects. I will state a few of them.

Battery life is amazing. The 6000 mAh battery  gives it almost a life of 1.5+ days of usage. I have the use my phone frequently for work as well as for entertainment so I am happy with the backup.

Once you switch to the 48 MP lens, the world you see through your phone is different altogether.  I took the snap when I was at least 80-100 meters from the tiger and the clarity  speaks for itself. Of course it takes a few moments to save the photo because of the size.

The performance is great in terms of gaming or streaming. I ran PUBG just for testing and it picked up High graphics settings by default.

The sound quality could have been a bit better. Just compared to my last phone (Moto Onr Power) the sound could have been a bit better. It's not bad though. It's good. I just wish it could have been great.

The screen is very responsive and the wide angle photography is a major asset.

I'm using this phone since the last few days and till now my experience has been amazing.

1. Battery : Battery life is the best in it's segment. If you're a casual user, it'll easily last you 3 days. If you watch a lot of Netflix shows, you can finish a season in a full charge.😃

2. Charging : 15 watt fast charger takes about 2 hours 15 minutes to charge it from 0 to 100 percent.

3. Processor : Exynos 9611 coupled with 4 gb ram handles day to day activities smoothly.
It can also handle casual gaming in medium settings easily.

4. Display : The super amoled screen is amazing. Colours are punchy and the blacks are really black. Viewing angles are very good.
Also the always on display feature is really helpful.

5. Sound Quality : Speaker sound quality is pretty good but the audio quality of the headphone jack is amazing. If you connect your headphones, dolby atmos gets automatically activated and you can also use bit upscaling to enhance the audio.

6. Camera : The pictures comes out really good under natural light. The wide angle lens can take very wide shots. The colours are natural and not over saturated.
Also the video stabilization is very good.

Despite the phone having a massive battery, it feels very comfortable to hold.
One UI is packed with features and user friendly.
The fingerprint sensor is well placed and is pretty fast.
The face unlock works pretty good at night by increasing the brightness of the screen.

Some not so good points :

1. I'm not saying that the screen protection on this phone is bad but gorilla glass 5 would have been perfect.

2. If you're a heavy gamer then this phone is not for you.

I hope my review helps.

The best smartphone in this price range. Samsumg has unbeatable screen and i am loving it. All the features are up to the mark. Screen, camera and battery life are the best features of the phone. The phone does not feel heavy or too large. I will recommend the pearl white color because white looks most "classy". It certainly gives you the premium feel when you use it.
Only competitor of this phone right now is realme XT but first it is more costly and secondly it is a new brand which is constantly competing with its own phones with every phone new month. You will not fell like having a new phone after another release which a felt with my old xiomi. Above all Samsung branding does gives the phone a mid range look like realme and xiomi.
The only flaw which i feel is the UI which is good but not like the stock android. Some features of samusung ONE UI are not well developed or optimized but also some features are great also. But is like the same with other competetors also so no option.

Fingerprint reader has is placed at the back..would have preferred for an on screen fingerprint sensor since i have to pick the phone up everytime to unlock.
Battery life is the best..it goes on for 2 days straight if you are a normal kind of user else it goes for 1.5 days if you use it rigorously too.
Camera comes with ultra wide lens which is good and also the 4k video recording is stable while taking a video. I have attached some ultra wide cam photos for help.
There bo problem with storage and Ram as it has plenty of it.
I would have wished for a phone cover in the box but it's fine as you can get it at other places too.
The gradient color combination gives a very different look to the phone.
I got this phone in offer at the price of 14k..128gb rom variant.
In such less price it's a good investment is what i feel.

Overall it's good, Camera quality is Good. ( It depends on which product you are comparing. )
Hardware information is missing. ( Do not know whether Samsung hide purposely or not )
All kind of application works fine.
The screen is really good.
Sound Quality Fair.
Call Quality Good. ( No / less high-frequency noise observed during call-in open area)
Samsung automatically uninstalls few necessary applications: GPay, Quick Ride and many more which I used as a daily bases.
Unzip didn't worked.

I'm writing review after 01 month usage
Fingerprint scanner lagging
Auto bright never work
48MP camera; quality is very low
Camera performance not good, is only name with high pixel
WiFi with 5G &amp; 2.4G band very weak in signal gauging.
The phone never works in low network bandwidth with 02 points.
Notification disable functions not works properly. It turns ON byitself.
Finger scan i can rate 1 out of 5.
Faceunlock not able to recognise and every time requires unlock password.

Only one point is good with battery life.

I could see few people give bad review not sure may be they felt it.
But I would suggest to buy this M30s. Its main trump card is its battery , super amoled display. Generally the samsung batteries run for long time bcz i have one samsung phone from last 7 years still baterry keeps backup 1/2 day. So this battery will also run for long as compared to other Chinese phones.

At the budget range ,Samsung always TOTALLY fails. The product looks so cheap and plasticky that u don't want to even to go into the features. The amoled screen looks unimpressive. I feel xiaomi is a much better buy in this range and looks very premium. Pls don't waste money on this product.

Phone performance was satisfactory for couple of months. Now even after full day plugged, battery never gets charged beyond 70% on fast mode. Similarly battery discharges within four or five hours completely. In the beginning, used to charge once in two days and battery used to be fully charged within couple of hours. I don't play games, or make calls frequently. Inspite of sparingly used, battery is not charging fully and discharges fast. It is not even six months old and I don't know how to go about to get rectified.

After a long time gap i bought samsung phone.  My first android phone was also of samsung.
I have used this phone for almost a week and i have found out following :
*Its 6000 mah battery is one of the amazing feature of this phone . Even if my phone is 45 % charged ,i can go all the day without charging.
*Camera is very amazing. Triple camera enhances the photo quality and enables with multiple camera features . Slow motion works undoubtedly well.
*Screen size enables to get perfect view of videos
*Fingerprint sensor works well
*Face recognition feature of this phone works perfectly outstanding.
*No lag

One feature which distuinguishes it from MI phone:-
There is no heating issue .MI phones heats and this issue is constant with its new models.

CONS-I have noticed just one cons of it that is phone is bit heavy than other devices ,this mah be justified that it has 6000mah battery

Good phone for normal use. Not so great in terms of battery and Camera quality. Battery is comparable to any other phone having 4000 mAh capacity.

Headphones slot should have been made upside. So many unnecessary apps. Not required.

Same features are available in other brands in the range of 8-10K. Samsung is charging 14K for the brand value, nothing else.

Delivery is pathetic. It took 2 days to deliver them within 20 km of Bangalore. Didn't expect.

Everything mentioned is upto the mark.
But I personally feel camera quality and  hardware quality of mobile back cover (white background) are not up to the mark.

Performance, display, storage &amp; battery are the best.

Mobile is little heavy in terms of weight..

Overall,
In terms of internal features (Ram, storage, battery) with low price go for M series.
But In terms of features + premium hardware quality (lookwise) go for A series.

I had a bad delivery experience this time with Amazon. Very late delivery.

<div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R1TWS1FOZKSHTS"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81RCH8x1sdS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91KAaE5EV6S.png"/> So this is my phone upgrade after three years after my Leeco Le2 started showing it age
(Reason to upgrade is lack of dual volte, unreliable roms, battery drain)

BATTERY: hmm... what can I say it's a real monster in battery management and sure. I don't panic with this device about battery which makes the device experience so much better.

Gaming: My usage with Samsung M30s is very satisfying which consist of light to medium gaming(call of duty) heating not much and game play is smooth and also played in high graphics and high frame rate didn't get any issues with the normal gameplay the display is great so I find it very engaging to play. Recommended for Occasional entertainment.

Camera: Samsung stock Camera and its ui usage is good no lags or issues.
M30s shines when it has the correct lighting which presents with natural colours photos. What I like most is the eis and super steady mode really impressive for this price and using it really makes a good difference.
Super slowmo is also quite good and sharp.
What I feel can be better is night mode because images taken are washed out with colours. Hope this will be fixable in software update. Maybe will try Google camera later.

Display: summarized in these words "Super amoled by Samsung"

Sound: inbuilt speakers are loud enough and crisp and clear.
Headphone jack 3.5mm is a gold feature.
I will suggest people consider phones with this amazing feature above your priority list because going without a headphone jack for three years was really painful on my pocket and experience. Because I brought three bluetooth headphones and many ctype to 3.5mm adapters all becomes cumbersome to use in a daily basis even though I brought an expensive bluetooth headphones(expensive than my phone! though audio quality is good but charging to hear a audio every 8hrs and then after a year of use battery backup of bluetooth  headphones gets low. I don't think it's a solution for a good audiophile and for making the world a better place)

ONE UI: quite close to stock with good features list and one more reason to like this phone and no ads. Smooth like a butter.

Summarize the initial impression
A perfect allrounder. if you like to bench watch your favorite movie or a YouTube content then this is for you. With a 3.5mm jack it's a icing on the cake
A monster from Samsung's lineup that is not so monsters in our wallet!

Will keep you guys updated with more usage.

Thank you for reading an experience.

It has 6000mAh but doesn't think you can play games for more hours compared to 4000mAh equipped phones.

This phone has amazing AMOLED display, reasonably good fingerprint scanner, 6000mAh but it will long depend upon your usage.

It has 3 cameras but it can take good pictures at good lighting conditions. Even though it has dedicated night mode you can't take good pics at low lights, unlike the similarly priced smartphones. And you can't install Gcam.

You can play games but performance is not smooth as Snapdragon 7xx series.

I have heard that if you're a frequent user of Google maps or compass then go for other smartphones. Because it's not working properly.

So for whom it is good?
Who watches more multimedia content, then the Super AMOLED display with 6000mAh will be great.
You can't see any lag in the day to day usage
You can run any apps.
And Android 10 will come in 2020 for this phone.
Samsung Brand value
Lower SAR value.

If you're looking for Camera or great gaming experience then go with other smartphones.

Battery life though it has been said as monster but gits don't expect too much thing is not worst batteryif you keep mobile screen always on and then it life leads to 1.5 days else the battery will be atleast minimum two days .

Camera quality is awesome if you have samsung m30s and don't like camera its then because of you didnt change the aspect ratio

Gaming was too God I played pubg carom cod and all online game . No lagging I felt

Battery drop very bless while night time and also while playing game ..
Screen auto adjustment is really awesome

I asked many of then review and I saw some worst review also but genuinely speaking it's good device go doe it ...

NFC IR blast are the thin not available then from finger print apart from that all is well

If you are actually looking for a phone between above range then go for it.
-&gt;Battery life is very good. I charge once in two days. I mainly use for outlook/skype calls/social media/calls/songs etc and not much into gaming. So this phone(4GB RAM) is more than ok for me.
-&gt;Though not much satisfied with camera (I look so fake in my pics on this phone) display is awesome!
-&gt; Audio is awesome
-&gt; Charging is super fast
-&gt; Havent seen any hang issue with apps yet
-&gt; Fingerprint sensor is instantaneous

Except for the camera..
The mobile is a worst purchase...exynos doesn't meet up to expectations compared to snapdragon processors. Display and touch are the worst. Fingerprint sensor is waste. It wont recognize you at many instances.. calls cant be attended or disconnected as required. The phone decides when you cut a call or when you pick it up. Need to swipe 6 to 7 times just to attend a call. Had been using redmi 4 . This was my upgrade and i feel sorry for myself. Could have sticked with redmi 4 itself.

I was using redmi 6 pro, before Samsung M30s.
Pros. Camera is good 4/5
Battery life is good 4/5
Display 4.5/5
Sound 4/5
Its processor is equivalent /slightly better than SD 665

Cons.
1. 3.5mm Jack headphone connector is at the bottom which is difficult to handle phone sometimes.
2. RAM optimization is not good.
Eventhough it have 4GB ram it seems only 1 GB ram is left even without games.( several banking apps, irctc, etc only using)

Note: If you are purchasing this on an offer then it's value for money.
Also SAR value (Radiation level) of this phone is very less when compared to other high end phones.

This is a  smart, slim, powerful, contemporary phone, at a reasonable price point. I think similar (almost) specs are available from Redmi and others at a lower price point, but Samsung is worth a bit of a premium.
Features which I like include the dedicated micro sd card, great battery good enough for 2 days, quick charge, good audio. Yet to try the camera fully. After using it for a few month, I see only one slight problem : several apps don't install on this phone, reporting an error in unzipping the app files. While I am puzzled by this, it has not been a serious  limitation for me as of now.

This product is not upto my expectation front camera is 16mp but quality is not like that....no advance features like vivo and MI .....since last 5 years i am using vivo that is far far far better then this model......no phonecover is there .

Its take 2 hours 17 minutes to charge this phone...whtsapp and hike kind of basic apps are hanging....samsung model is hanging from 1st weak of using itself...i get nothing from this cellphone ....waste of money i feel that.....

I like this mobile.
Highlight features - display &amp; battery
Offers Best quality display at below Rs. 15k price. I heard about the superiority of sAMOLED display over ips display very often while watching YouTube reviews of Samsung phones. But I didn't realize that when I have a brief hands on a50 phone of my colleague. I came to experience the real quality of led display after purchasing this mobile while watching  movies on Amazon prime especially while looking at blacks. It shows us how dark should  be the black. Wide color gamut it can produce gives us better viewing experience.
6000 mAh battery gave me 10 hours backup in 30 hour mid - heavy range usage. This is the best among the all phones I have used till now. Redmi note 6 pro comes at second with 8 hours backup.
Build quality may not be as great as redmi note 7 pro. But it is good.
You might find better mobiles for gaming. But for regular usage it is more than enough.
Camera is good in daylight. But low light photography is not satisfying.
Over all it is worthy phone. If you watch movies a lot and you hate to charge the phone regularly this phone is highly recommended.

I am written this review after 18 days of use.
I have purchased 6 GB RAM white colour
Mobile is getting heat the heat temperature is so high that you need to switch off your mobile. Camera quality se good even battery is also working fine. About performance it looks like we are using 3 GB RAM system is acquiring near about 3.4 GB of RAM so you will be getting only 2.6 GB RAM for use. PUBG GAME is also not working not value for money. If we are listening to song at that time mobile is also getting heat. Never expect this from SAMSUNG
Please don't bye it

Good Phone for day today use. Camera is good under bright light but needs improvement for low light photography.  Battery back up is good compared to other phones,but need a bit of improvement in battery life when considering the 6000 mAh capacity! Build quality is good, only downside is with the back panel, it attracts scratches very easily and back cover is must. The phone heats up when continuous gamming due to which game starts lagging and frame rate drops considerably.This is the only major consequence !

I bought M30s as i am using mostly samsung phone. The overall phone is good. But i found fast charger is not actually charging fast. It take 1.30hrs to got fully charge. The batterybackup of phone is good but as the battery is of 6000mah i aspect more. With video watching  normal calling and normal brightness battery just runs more than 24 hrs but less than 36 hrs. The body of phone is of plastic. It not looks premium at all. Overall m30s phone is good and its value for money.

Must say the promise made by the phone stands fulfilled! The handset was worth the wait as I had wanted to get my hands on this since the time the details first came out. I had opted out of some phones offering similar configuration for the quality offered by Samsung. Got the phone at a discounted price on the first day of the sale itself exchanging my older phone. The phone offers solid performance on all fronts be it battery life...camera...speed...thumbs up to Samsung for creating such a masterpiece..

Great deal for great price... best feature is Camera with wide angle view and steady feature, only not problem is that some feature are not available in every mode...but common modes. Battery backup is superb.... I used it for straight 38 hours without charging with regular youtube and music stuff but still 15 %was available at the end of the day.
Other great feature  is battery backup, i have using now my phone with charging for 1.5 days and still is 38% and youtube, and other video apps are all working in continuation...

2 weeks and going smooth. Rest if any will update again🙂

1. Display - Excellent quality amoled, super fine touch, need screen protection as no Gorilla glass
give 4star for display
2. Build quality- Handi, but back panel is made of plastic, again have to useback cover to avoid scratch
4 star
3. Camera - Some good features like emoji, live focus, food are like others. 48mp camera is not upto the point but is still good in this price range. Slow motion video also good, somefeatures added. Super slow motion is of very short duration, disappointed as i cant shoot long duration
Will give 4 star
4. Battery- Excellent quality, very long lasting, after watching video, using roughly in day time and in high uses it lasts for more than 12 hours and some good features like power mode which saves your battery in less uses time.
Will give 5 star for battery
5. Network - Excellent quality again, in less network coverage area works fine than other mobiles. In good coverage net works very fast than other mobiles
Dual 4G is also good, both sim on 4G
So will give 4.5 star
6. Call quality - Very good, no voice disturbances, as it depends upon the service provider but from mobile side it is very good.
Some good feature like call recording, video calling button are good
Will give 4.5 star
7. Charger - It is fast charger of 2 A, not rapid charger, so takes around 1.8 to 2 hours to get charge from 20% to 98% charge
so will give 4 star.
8. Headphones - Not provided, disappointed
1 star for that
9. Sound quality - Dolby mode only be used with headphones and takes 2-3 seconds to get the effect. Sound quality, offcourse due to dolby is super. With Speakers is awesome.
will give 4 star, some improvement needs in update
10. Memory/speed - 4/64 good combination, exynos 9611 processor, super speed, for average users is good speed.
4 star

**** Some other features like fingerprint sensor, Some software changes are Excellent

Overall a good product in this price range. Main thing samsung has increased their quality in samll price ranges.
Final 4  ***** stars

It's good but not the best,

  Phone does not work and does not show any notification when a WhatsApp call arrives.

  As perr this price, the camera is also good.

  The battery is awesome.

  The face lock is a bit slow.

  Overall this phone is average, but if we mark the brand, this mobile is pretty good with this price.

I Believe we all bought this mobile due camera features also and we never ever believe that SAMSUNG will disappointe there customers, we all go through brand value too, but now Samsung brand value goes down.Samsung company has to do market research to there product because in INDIA 90% people buying smart phones on camera quality.50% people know what is megapixels in camera and Samsung cheated us if company don't having capacity to fit such genuine specification in m30s then why they selling there product in such low budget rate, they have to give us genuine feature with there actual range as desire for there brand value.I will not stop here, will do something on Samsung, I lose my money in 'GHATIYA' brand.

It's a nice mid budget phone or I must say the best in budget phone compared to other brands like Xiomi or Realms.Since Samsung's unmatched quality is assured in this phone along with all the necessary features.
The camera is even good and I don't see any flaws in it but truly speaking, the camera as compared to Samsung's heavy budget phones is not that good and cameras of OnePlus .
No chance of contradiction or criticism regarding battery life of M30s, it's just incomparable with any other smartphone.But yes we can say that there is a slight chance of 15 W fast charging is not that satisfactory in today's market of 18 W fast charging.Then too it's good.
Fingerprint sensor seems a bit improved in the low budget phone and the fibre body could have been made up of some other glossy or shiny material like that of OnePlus or Note 10.But it may lead to increase in cost so it's better to compromise on quality of back case.

Using the Samsung M30s for one month and here are my experiences with it:
bad points:
If compared to the MI phones of the same price range, the camera quality is poor, especially the front camera is very poor.
The processor performance is average. In a similar price range, you can get better processors than this.
The phone gets warm when kept in a pocket, this generally happens when there is "Always on display" feature ON.
The audio of the phone is very simple. Neither does it have much loudness nor sound quality
I was using an honor phone before this and I observed the network reception and call quality in Samsung m30s are worse as compared to honor.
phone in hand is not eyecatching, it looks like an average phone.

Good points:
The battery is good. Once fully charged, it gives backup of about 2 to 3 days
The display of the phone is good as it is Super AMOLED.
charging speed is OK, don't have to charge much as the battery is big.
Even having a 6000 mAh battery, the phone is not heavy and very comfortable to use.
Samsung branding can also be considered as an admirable point.

Don't buy this phone if you trust me.
Buy another if you want only from Samsung, this phone has very major issue, I never thought about it from samsung, after 3 month of uses my experience is here.
1) network issues more than expectation ,even I din't have time to review but I do it anyhow. Sometimes I am not able to make any call ,,but after restarted I can do it.net speed is too slow.
2) battery , nothing to say about battery, it is  said that it has monster battery, but sometimes I got 26-27% discharge, betweetn (6-7 hour in night)but sometimes only 1-2% even data is off.
3) camera , camera is of good quality ,but it takes more time to click one pic,sometimes it say that camera is not responding.
4 ) rest part is good I think, display is very good no doubt about  it
.
5) finally I am very disheartened from Samsung,  I never thought that Samsung will do it , because I trust Samsung,  but this phone is not to buy

My findings:
1.One word,Camera is not good.
Y to give 3 cameras,if theywork like this.
Give 1 and give good
2.processor is very avg,phone hangs
3.fingerprint sensor not working well
Even low cost android phones,this feature is good but not on this phone.
4.Face recognition is ok ok,not like iphones.

The goods are the display,sound,battery.

Last word,disappointed.

The phone price should be 7-8k max.
If u r buying this buy some other android which will give same specs at 6k

Honest review.
1. Both Camera front and rear is not upto the mark. Wide angle is very helpfull. Ultra slow motion is superb.
2. Battery back up lasts for one and half day on continuous use.
3. Very smooth and Super screen display.
4. No earphone provided :(
5. Phone becomes too hot after playing average graphic game. :(
6. Phone charges bit slow (takes 2-3hrs. for full charge). whould have provided higher amp. Output charger.
7. Length of USB cable is short.
8. Thickness of phone becomes more when you put back cover.
9. Auto Screen rotation bit slow.
Rest seems better under 17k it a worth one.

I had previously been using a MIA1(android one)
It was time for an upgrade. Chose m30s over mia3.
Was it a good choice.🤔?

Good things about the phone.
Amazing fullHD AMOLED display.
Cameras are good too.
Network connectivity is acceptable (used with jio &amp; bsnl)

Bad part of the phone.

Battery life i managed to get about 1.5 days (100% to 20%) for my below average usage even after having a 6000mah battery.

Takes about 2+ hours to charge from 20% to 100% with the included 15W fast charger.

In reference to my mia1(3000mah with lcd display)  i was still getting a battery life of 1.5 days for my regular usage.

May be the issue might get sorted with the upcoming update, but at the time of writing this review the battery life is pathetic for the mammoth battery.

I am not sure if the Exynos 9611 is any better than snapdragon 600 series available on mia3.

It's for sure snapdragon processors are more energy efficient than the Exynos.

One of the amazing plus about this product is battery. for those who extensively use the mobile this is best bit. Case is very strong. i didnt even put the cover and dropped it many times nothing happens , rock solid body. Overall there is lot of problem in this phone, the softwares are not very stable. after 6 month usage phone is showing the results of quality going down.  Battery no issue , speed no issue. unable to hear the opposite side voice and speaker is not effective after 6 month usage. i am now returning to Warrenty center to check it. Not sure everyone faces this problem. But i beleive this phone is not for more than one year considering the issues i have faced.

This is a poorly made phone. Within 4 months of buying I have had to visit the service center 3 times. Sometimes with motherboard issue(twice) and battery issue. Battery will work well for first 1-2 months but after that it will discharge very fast and charging will take approx. 4-5 hours. What kind of fast charging is that. The catch is that the phone will work well for the first 1-2 months and the buyers may be happy during that period. But after that this phone starts showing its true poor quality. I should have bought a Realme or Redmi instead. Feeling stuck with this phone.

Well, I was worried if this Samsung product will be the same as the initial day's galaxy series phones.
But no. This is totally different. The UI - one UI , is very nice and user friendly. Though I was a stock android user earlier, this seems even better.
The battery lives upto expectations, but drains fast if you have poor cellular signals...
Camera is good at this price range, that said, you will have all the camera features which the high end phones have.
Overall, at this budget, this is a wonderful phone. I hope of Samsung keeps updating the OS regularly to keep the phone fresh for quiet a time...

Good All round mobile.but having some issues like network reception is not good other phones having better signal even m20 is better,camera is not sharp it definitely needs a update and focus is too slow ,battery is good but I used m20 and m30 comparing that it is using much power maybe due to the new processor I think the draining is almost same in both m30 and m30s(a bit longer) but m30s has 6000 mah battery that can optimise better and It has only 15w charger it makes it charge bit longer.fingerprint  print scanner is super good it is easily recognizing but sometimes  has delay but that is not that noticeable,Facelock is very good even it is opening in low light or in dark and the speed is good as well.Slow motion,super motion and wide angle camera is decent(dont expect as clarity as rear camera) video recording is nice 1080@30fps has super steady mode and it actually works well.Display is in awesome clarity but it seems to be little warm coloured I choose  it to cool but still seems to be a warm colour.It has pretty decent sound output.For gaming it is good enough low graphics games are working well very well and for graphics games  it is good but you can see some framedrops and lags some often(it can even run HDR mode on pubg but having some framedrops).One UI is very nice it is super  smooth and I personally like the dark mode.If it is optimized well then it one of the best budget phone ever produced by samsung(just software issues) we can expect the issues resolved  in future updates from the samsung software team,I hope these are the most common pros and cons that a common user can notice,Thank you

Apart from all the known specs , what i liked most about this phone is the HUGE battery life which last 2.5 days in normal usage, for example i charge this phone on Monday and then i charge it on Wednesday , isnt it cool !

But what i feel is they should have provided a better fast charge technology, it takes 2 hours to charge phone from 10% to 100% , as its battery size is really large.
They give 15V charger ,instead they should have provided 25V or 35V

But ok that's not a big issue
Overall it's a good phone

Product looking wise is good and i will tell about other features- front camera quality  is very bad not a click single clear picture  and no more option available for front camera
2. Phone processor  to slow and more time taking for open simple applications  and in settings  normal option
3 . Network signals quality are too poor in normal time lost network  of phone .
4. Amazon  representatives  no one replaces item he will told them that downloads  our app and check it if there not found any issue then will not replaced  phone .
So totally  I give this phone rating 0 and amazon response service  are too poor so I suggest  you guys don't purchase Samsung m30s phone . Go and find other phone in same price range  .

I grab it for just 11,599😱 with SBI debit card+AMAZON1000 rs cash back offer.REVIEW after 90 days.
1.DISPLAY- (9/10)....display is really stunning just awesome...it's super amoled of samsung...+ FHD+😍
2.BUILT QUALITY-( 5/10)....8.9 mm thick u have to compromise beacuse of it's 6000mah battery....but the weight distribution is awesome(188g only)....great job samsung😍.....but back is plastic/low quality glossy polycarbonate and the plastic is loosely attached . Initially I thougt that I had got the defective piece but that not the case it is the problem of every item because of the battery...😢...side pannel is also loosely attached looks like u pressed the button like some thing.Not premium like glass like RN 8PRO/REALME XT.
3.CAMERA (REAR)-7/10...48 MP is not that great. 48MP camera senseor probably it's Samsung's GM2...but not that great like SONY IMX586...so disappointed...8mp wide angle is good it's 123°.
And depth sensor is 5mp just ok...like
CAMERA (SELFIE)-(5/10)...it's 16 MP...Very bad and soft and not capturing more detail like realme XT.
BATTERY- 9/10😱.....battery backup is awesome lite use...2day and heavy usage...1day..
FULL CHARGEING TIME-2.30 hr...which is ok for CHARGEING 6000mah battery(5830mah)
Game- I am not a game lover like you guys
But you can play pubg or asphalt 9 on it but it is heated after 30-40min...
😂I think samsung phones are not for gamming like pub g or else...but the processor is EXYNOS 9611...based on 10 nm ....it has 4 arm cortex A73 cores+4 arm cortex A53...and gpu is MALI g72mp 3 i think so...but not that great....So if you are a game lover just go for REDMI NOTE 8 PRO OR REALME X2.
PERFORMANCE-(7/10)....EXYNOS 9611 is a 7 series processor compared with Snapdragon 665 or little better than it.It is power efficient chip obviously.
NFC NOT SUPPORTED NO SECURE FOLDER APP AND GOOD LOCK APP SUPPORT...REMEMBER IT..AND UI IS ONE UI 1.5 AND IT IS IN CORE VERSION BUT ONE UI IS VERY GOOD I LIKE IT.
AND IN THE END SAMSUNG DID A GOOD JOB .WHAT CAN WE EXPECT MORE THAN IT FROM SAMSUNG....
Hope it will help u guys...😁

I will review this phone on the basis of practical usuage.
1) Battery : On normal usuage which means watching content online aprrox 3 hours,usual surfing for 4-5 hours, listening songs about an hour, the phone holds to about 25-30 hours after fully charges.
It takes about 135 mins to fully charge from about 15-20% battery
2) camera : Front camera is ordinary, i was using oppo and it came better pics
Rear camera is good , but takes time to click pics and adjust effect .
3) Multiapplication usuage: It smoothly runs multiple app very happy with that.
4) screen: Its the best part , optimum use of space of mobile and very clear , its like holding a mini tv on palm.

Writing this after 2 weeks of usage.
Cons
It doesn't have sensor to sense light. Uses camera instead of that. So, it takes time to get the mobile locked when we are in call and getting the mobile closer to ear. Adaptive brightness also facing same issue.
Taking more time for charging.
Pros
Battery life is excellent.
Camera is good.
Charger cable is short. It will help us to avoid using mobile when it is charging. Don't buy a lenghty cable 😊

Its my bestie's gift. It should be best.

Hey guys, I bought it for my sister.It is looking amazing .After observation of one month, I am pretty clear about this mobile.whenever it comes battery with 6000 mAh it is just awesome but it feels like 5000 mAh battery which I didnt like it.It comes with super AMOLED ( water drop notch ) as like all samsung mobiles which is common.The processor exynos 9611 which is launched by samsung recently.when it comes processor I will give 2 out of 5 because of too much lag.It is taking too much time to load photos on gallery.camera is very nice for this price segment.i often see processing problem on samsung low range mobiles. I will not recommend for this mobile.you can go with poco f1 with the same price range which much more better than M30s.

Random heating in around makes this a crap product. Random heating is prone to human hazard. Reported in return window but all customer care people of Aamzon only fooled me and everyone of them were only  refering me to service centre which I am sure was just to hide their failre at higest level. I am sure I am not the only one facing this software issue of return window.

It is a good phone from Samsung. If you got small hands you will find it difficult to operate with one hand.
PROS:
Screen quality is top notch.
Battery lasts around 1.5 days for normal usage (even if it is 6000 MAH).
Overall features rich phone.
Call quality is good.

CONS:
Camera quality is pathetic. Takes soft pictures. Both front and rear cameras are average quality.
Little bit big in size.

If you are looking to get a decent phone with AMOLED screen and good battery life, go for it. Not to be bought if you are buying for Camera.

The  pros of phone : till date samsung best midbuget smartphone to buy with SAmoled display , biggest battery with 6000 mah it's best to hold and its light weight makes more comfortable,  the way the back panel shines its beautiful , the processor is good for day to day work and gaming too , and the new samsung UI 1.5 makes it more smoother
No cons till date  as I am using it around 5 days its smooth

Galaxy M30s is not your average smartphone. It can easily beat flagship phones in terms of display, battery and UI. Detailed review is as follows:

1. Battery: 6000mah is monster. Excellent battery backup. Even powerbank cannot fully charge this phone. 1.5 days of usage comes very easily. Charging speed is also very fast thanks to 5amp charger and type C port system.

2. Cameras: Camera quality is alright. The colors are almost true to source but images lack sharpness, which can be solved with software update. Can record 4K videos,  superslows and support steady mode even in wide angle on. Selfie camera is ok. Not too good but not too bad. It gets the job done.

3. Display: sAmoled display looks so good. Darks are dark and whites are white. It also supports auto brightness and always on display (which is a feature you see in premium smartphones).

4. Build quality: Its the part where Samsung has cut corners. Samsung has used plastic panel with dual tone kind of finish. It looks great but it's not that durable. A back cover is a MUST. I dropped my phone from 1 feet and the top right edge has got some edges. I used Zenfone max pro m1 before that and that phone was absolute brick. Though the phone is not very heavy to used, considering its big battery, the weight distribution is well done.

5. UI/OS: One UI is very well optimized. There're no lags in day to day usage and interface is very fluid. But it's personal preference.

6. Hardware: Exynos 9611 is a very good chipset. Its new and quite capable of handling the load. But i would say the phone is not for gaming purposes, you can play heavy resource games on medium settings for enjoyable playtime.
RAM and storage are fast and OneUI is does good job in RAM management. Most of the basic sensors are available and the fingerprint reader is accurate and fast but not the fastest in the market.

7. Sound: Loudspeaker is good. It's crisp and clear but not the loudest one. The headphone audio output is outstanding. It's gold. The output is very clear and you have Dolby atmos feature too.

If you find the review helpful then like it.

Samsung Galaxy M30 series is surely a cut above. It's like getting gold in silver's price. It's working good till date and hope so it lasts. The fingerprint reader was a little problematic in the beginning but soon we got used to it or rather it got used to us. The camera quality is a cut above in this price range. The true bang for the buck is in the battery life of the phone. The fast charging combined with the long lasting battery makes it good as a traveling accompaniment.

Bought it for camera, 48+8+5 is just on paper, picture quality is just 5 MP, even a 2500 phone clicks better than this...front camera is super pathetic, it's 2mp.

Don't buy this item guys. Go for other options.

It's a worst choice. Wastage of money.

PROs-

Just one Pro ie 6000 mAh battery, but for that Battery backup You will not throw away Your hard earn 14000 rupees.

CONs-

1) CAMERA quality is big draw back. In 14k You will get Redmi Note 7pro, RealMe X,Xt with better camera quality than this.

2) Panel is of low quality plastic which is giving crackling sound. Which is annoying and worrisome

Waste of money please don't buy Samsung M30S Camera clarity was not satisfied it's not a 48Mp camera look's like 8MP 😠😠😠feeling bad about Samsung m30S....
Please don't buy it🙏🙏🙏

I have been a Mi fan for a long time and used quite a few Mi phones. However, I got lured by the specs, particularly the huge 6000 mah battery to change team and buy a Samsung instead.
And, I am throughly disappointed. Firstly, I got the 6gb RAM variant. Despite this, the phone feels quite slow. I mean really slow compared to the specs. Just try to search for something within settings (eg battery settings) and see how much time it takes. Or, see how much time it takes to install / update any app. While the gile is downloaded fast due to wifi, it takes a long time to update. It serms to me that Samsung probably throttled the processor to match the price.
Secondly, I missed the beautiful small tweaks of MIUI, which is a thousand times better, particularly as I couple it with Google now launcher or nowadays Nova launcher with nova Google companion. I missed the utilities like 'dual apps'. While Samsung restricts dual apps to only WhatsApp / Facebook ; MIUI lets any app to be converted like paytm / future pay/ etc. Also, the in system 'app lock' of MIUI was sorely missed.
MIUI still provides 'battery saving' mode of location overriding Google restrictions which was lacking.
I never thought that I would miss the IR blaster (remote control) so much as I did.
The Samsung software seems half cooked, that too carelessly. For instance, in balanced battery mode, it defaults the gmail app to sleep. It gave me quite a scare when no email notifications were coming, until I could Google the solution of manually disabling sleep for gmail.
The biggest selling point, the battery is strictly average compared to the specification. If you like to read a lot like me(screen awake), it will last you a day and a half and not more.
Also, the fingerprint scanner is slightly slower and less accurate than what I used before.
The camera is good along expected lines, but again nothing extraordinary compared to the specs. Though the slow motion / super slow motion seems great for those who can use it. Also, the screen is quite bright and good. These two are the only saving graces.

I have never used an iPhone and wondered how could seemingly not dumb folks become 'fanboys' while Android phones with better specs in a fraction of a price are available. Now, after dumping the MIUI(albeit with Google now launcher), I feel their fascination, at least to some extent.
I am sorry, if it sounds like a hagiography of MIUI. Of course the bloatwares and irritating advertisements of MIUI are not here. But you could always disable them in MIUI.
Overall, despite great specs on paper, the M30s feels quite underpowered even during daily usage. Specs are not everything.
If you can accept a slightly lesser camera, Redmi note 8 pro will be a  much much better choice in terms of performance as well as other features, just uninstall the bloatwares first and maybe add a custom launcher like Nova.

1) Operation is very smooth
2) Display is as not good as competitors
3) Bhid Quality as not good as similar budget phone
4) Battery and software is a class in others similar budget phone
5) 48 MP camera is very pathetic, night mode is not up to the mark
6) Phone heats on near front camera and ear pieces
7) Multitasking is not up to the mark
8) Touch sensitivity is class leading
9) AI experience is not up to the mark
10) Game turbo function is good
11) RAM management is very good

Hence keep in mind all the pros and cons you may consider this phone only for long battery use and business use ...

You cannot consider it as multimedia prior phone ..

I had given it 4 star as of now with one+ month use

There is no good thing about this phone. Phone has 6 gb ram, works like 2 gb ram phone. Phone has 6000 mah battery and drains below 1 day even without using it. Camera is like 48mp, works like 12mp and images are of bad quality. Cannot take calls with loud speaker and call drops every time even with full signal. Had to place a replacement due to phone's malfunction, which Amazon failed to replace and now asking us to return and take refund, bad experience with Amazon and build quality is poor.

Well m30s is a perfect  package at this price from a well reputed brand .i would like to share my honest opinion about this smartphone.

Pros
1.screen quality  is superb  as it comes with superamoled display.
2.battery is massive so you dont need to worry about  battery life.
3.its UI is very smooth and attractive. Nearly  stock android  experience with some extra features.
4.sound quality  is good as it comes with dolby atmos.
5.camera quality is good .

Cons
1. Display doesn't come with any protection like gorilla glass, so you need to apply tempered glass in order to protect  display.
2.network reception  is not good as of now..may be it will be improved  via ota if possible.
3.design is weak as the quality  of plastic is not good.

I hope these points will help those who wants to buy this smartphone

I am not very happy to purchase it but I am satisfied with it . I purchased it in big billions days sale and after all discounts  it was worth of Rs 11600. Let's see some pros and cons I noticed till now.
Pros:
1. good battery backup (last upto 1.5 days with optimal usage and 2 days with minimal usage)
2. Notch style and amoled display (looks good)
3. It came with 1 year aco warranty for screen
Cons:
1. camera is not up to the mark
2. Finger print sensor is slow
3. Phone doesn't feel premium quality phone (I was using moto g5 s plus and it was great)
4. Some sensor functions missing like shake phone to on torch light etc (given in my previous phone)
5. Handsfree Jack is given in bottom side which is giving issues while putting phone in pocket while handsfree is connected.
Overall it's a good phone if you're looking for good battery backup and you are an average camera user.

Very balanced phone. Purchaged it for around ₹14,300. A great product from Samsung. As advertised, it has a very impressive battery life. It can easily last for 2 days. Good back camera but lacks the quality of sony sensor. Quality of front camera is not up to the mark. Display is amazing. One UI is very easy to use. Have not witnessed any heating or lag issue whatsoever. Dolby Atmos presence greatly enhances your music and movies experience. Overall a great budget phone with Samsung branding. Can't ask for more at this price range. Welcome back Samsung. Highly satisfied.

I had more expectations with camera and fingerprint... We have to select 48mp every time to have clear photography... 4k videography is simply awesome... Screen display and processor speed is wonderfull.. battery backup is 2day after playing 4hr pubg game per day without charging. Charging 0-100 in 3hrs. Phone is not at all heating up while charging. Back of the phone looking quite trendy... Phone is light weight as per 6000mah battery. It is lighter than my vivo V17pro... Best for personal use and gifting to loved Ones. I make u sure that they will surely like it very much.

First thing first, I have given 3 Star coz the packing quality was not as it should be for the safety of phone.
Device Review :
Battery life is good but it should last long as it is 6000 mAh. Camera quality is good but not as per 48 MP with triple camera. Fingerprint sensor is really disappointing as there is latency. Best thing about this phone is Display as per my opinion. Sound quality while using earphones is awesome as it comes with Dolby sound. It could be still improved in terms of quality and performance as promised by the company in their advertisement. Processor is quite good. At the last you should consider how you wanna you use your phone which means what are the main features you are looking for.

Samsung yet again proved that its the leader in mobile technology in the world with this model Galaxy M30s.The sheer battery power and the tough screen are a proof in itself.Though there are many new entrants ,samsung chose to launch this brilliant piece of art at the right time .Customers are the kings,so Samsung the King leading the bunch with this new amazing model.In the last few years this is the best model. Kudos

It's too early to say but mobile if awesome in terms of screen, photo &amp; battery.
Sometimes it's shows washed out colors &amp; sometime it's capture a good click so it's totally depends on condition you are in.
But I say it's complete package in its price segment.
I got is at effective price of ₹8,549 after applying all offers so on personal basis a good deal.
Its 2 weeks till now no heating, good camera, fluid OS &amp; the sound is amazing. SuperAmoled screen is awesome.

Honest review of 15 days used. Overall mobile is Ok in this price range. Good Display. Camera is not excellent but better then other in this range,No pure whiteness. You can take pictures like actual one. Fingerprint and Face Unlock sensor is not better but good. I am very unhappy with its battery it's 6000mAh battery but not looks that.After full charge you can used upto 24 hours in normal use. It takes 2 and Half hours to full charge after Samsung providing Fast charging charger. There is no App Lock facilities, so you have to download third party app for App lock. No internet speed meter. If you wants to buy Samsung Brand smartphone then go for it in this price range. Overall performance is good.

Display is amazing
Performance acceptable
Battery life is commendable
Camera also on par.... if not amazing
Overall look and feel is good
Comfortable to use with one hand.
Feels light in hand.
Overall we feel like having a premium phone in our hand.
For 12999 (1000 rupees cashback) it's the best now.
One issue compared to my MI NOTE 5 PRO is that the network reception is poor. When MI clocks 3mbps download speed, this one catches only 1.4mbps. I tried to return the product,  but Amazon says phone has no problem.  So am keeping it. But no more Samsung phone ever. My next phone is MI K20 for sure.  Previous one was MI note 5 pro and previous to that was again MI Max 2. As you can see MI is more superior than Samsung.  Beware Samsung....
ADDITION : -- I was wrong about Amazon. They are just great. GREAT... They replaced my handset with new one after having their technician visited me at my house to check the problem. Actually the handset has no probs, but the chipset has lower power setting to pick signals. As a result the new phone also could not give good reception at my area. Amazon took the second handset back and refund me in full.
What a great shopping experience. My purchase become useless for me but Amazon saved me. Thanks Amzon. You just earned a happy customer for life.

This mobile is monstrous. Compared to the price at which it comes this mobile is a steal deal. Definitely one of the best mobile phones in the budget range available now in the market. Samsung has given really tough competition to the market by bringing this mobile.

Pros:

1) The super-amoled screen is really amazing. A whopping 6.4-inch FHD+ capacitive touchscreen with 2340 x 1080 pixels resolution. The mobile gives a really good view even in bright lights.

2)The monstrous 6000mAH lithium-ion battery with fast charging,15W Type-C fast charger is provided which is amazing. The battery life is really great although it takes a lot of time to get charged due to massive battery size.

3)Android v9.0 Pie operating system provides a hassle-free experience. It is definitely very user-friendly.

Cons:

1) 48MP + 8MP + 5MP triple rear camera | 16MP front-facing camera is provided, although the picture quality is not that great when compared with other mobiles in the same segment. Clarity is missing.

2) The finger-touch sensor is very bad. It takes several attempts to get unlocked which is very annoying.

3) 2.3GHz + 1.7GHz Exynos 9611 octa-core processor is present but the mobile lags a lot when several apps are opened. It gets heated up after sometimes.

Overall I will give this mobile a rating of 4 stars. Although it has lots of cons still I think the pros triumphs. So people can totally buy it for normal day-to-day work. But steer clear of this if u want for great photography or for gaming.

Awesome phone at the given price
I was never really a fan of Samsung ever and always thought that if your budget is below 30k, you should not choose samsung.
But Galaxy M30S has changed my mind.
Frankly, I was hesitant to go for Samsung and was having doubt to go for Realme or Redmi.
But seeing the features, I couldn't resist and believe me I am so happy now after using the phone for last 3 days.
Awesome display, battery, touch is super smooth, camera is decent enough - everything you expect and you get it on this phone.
Only missing feature - they should have given gorilla glass 5 instead of gorilla glass 3.
But definitely this big brand is making some noise with this awesome phone at this budget.

Unsurprisingly M30S is super impressive.. Sub15k segment competition is truely demolished by Samsung.. further a cashback of 1000 on Amazon pay is cherry on cake. So net price is 12,999.
At this price ; Super amoled FHD display of 6.4 " + 6000 mAh battery + 48 mp triple rear camera + Samsung Ui is a Big Win Win.
Rare to complain about anything at this product considering its price.

# Samsung has finally nailed it's price setting. (Unlike A50s 🤨😉)

The camera's overall performance is fine and except night shots. The fingerprint reader is not that bad when compared to the on-screen fingerprint scanner available in other Samsung models. Regarding the technical aspect of the camera, battery power sustainability, etc.. Will be reviewed by the expertise and as a user, I have noticed the quality of the outer shell of the handset has been compromised especially the frame and the back cover. The back cover was wrapped with a transparent protection sheet along with the sealed box. I used the phone with a protection sheet until I received the protection cover which I ordered through Amazon. To my surprise, I observed a lot of scratch marks found on the back cover made by the transparent protection sheet provided by the Samsung box pack. The quality of back cover plastic is par below then the quality of the first generation Samsung Galaxy S i9000 series. I would suggest the new customers remove the OEM plastic wrapper and use it until you fix a protection cover. Otherwise, the OEM protection sheet itself will damage the back cover due to friction caused by rubbing against each other.

Review after usage for 4 months: The phone is an excellent device, charges pretty quick and has a good camera, which lacks, as I mentioned earlier, only in night shots. Its display is exceptional, as expected from Samsung and can get very dim as well as a brightness that is clearly visible in sunlight. The display is very vibrant and has a wide color gamut. The OLED display displays true blacks, and so the display is the best part of this phone. The battery is ENORMOUS and can last 2 days straight(based on my usage) without the need to charge. If it weren't for the back easily scratching even with careful use, this phone would get a five-star rating from me. I'd highly recommend this phone and advise you to get a case ASAP.

the overall phone is good but this is not as much performing as other phones does. I think it is because of its processor. The battery is only big thing in this phone that's it.
fingerprint leader always stuck, it is not as fast as compared to other smartphones in this range. the battery performance is quite ok. if you are a very heavy user means you always use to use your phone for WhatsApp Instagram YouTube and the gaming for 1 to 2 hour this phone with give you one day battery backup. now it depends on you how use it. camera quality is not so impressive. I do not like the front camera which is of16 megapixel. NDS the main issue with Samsung galaxy m30 s is its network problem.

First thanks to Amazon for superfast Delivery within 24 hours. And superb 3 in one deal. 10% discount. 1000 cashback and one year screen replacement. Is se better aur kya chahiye wali jabardast feeling.

Lets talk about my new phone.
Superb power packed smartphone, beyond the expectations in today's digital life.
Great battery, not only on paper, it's just challenge me till about 48 hours with a single charge.
Battery is the first USP.
But with a huge battery it's not heavy weight or bulky handling. Also comes with fast charging c type . . Fast charger also include in the box.

Build quality is not great but not very poor. Material is ok but colors are nice.
In this budget its comes with super amoled display . . Screen quality is superb. 411 PPI.

Excellent triple rear camera combination 48+8+5 . . Brilliant detailing, sharp clristal clear photo. Also 16 megapixel camera for selfie lovers.

It is much more ahead than the M30.

Last but not the least . . The surprisable price tag . . . 13999 and 16999.

After 4 Days use . . . I just loved it. Its blast launching from samsung . . Tough competitor for all budget smartphone.

Camera is pathetic. At this range never expected cheating from such a brand. Feeling annoyed.
The camera automatically Zooms in to the face in Selfie mode and there's no option to take at normal angles. Also the picture is very dull and blurry. Back camera is also poor

Overall phone is good
Cons as per me are colour on the back panel and rear camera as it's something like 12mp only
Pros as per me are Display simply awesome, 🔋 is amazing
Bad thing about amazon is that i didn't receive Amazon pay cashback of 1000₹.....😭😭😭

For Rs.11500(including offer during great Indian sale) this is the best phone one can get.  Powerful processor and battery. Display is brilliant. Eventhough camera doesn't feels like 48 mp, it is  still good enough which allows you to click great pictures under day light. Low light photography could have been better. Eventhough the body is plastic, it has got some classy look. There is no over heating problems. Batterty requires around 2.5 hrs for full charge. But it is acceptable considering the massive 6000 mah. Fingerprint sensor is working fine. Overall it is really good phone. Even without offers, it is worth the price.

Hello friends,

I am using this mobile from last 3 days. My overall impression is mobile is very good considering the price range. Let me give the detailed review step by step:

1. Display: Samsung's sAmoled  displays are best in the market. I just love it.
2. Sound: The sound is quite loud and clear. It also has Dolby atoms which is a good feature to have.
3.Battery: The battery is whooping 6000 mah which can last up to 2 days with moderate usage. On heavy usage though it can last up to 1 day.
4. Perfomance: It has exynos 9611 processor with 6 GB ram which works really well if you are into gaming. Pubg works in high settings with no legs at all.
5.Design: The phone is little bulky but considering its 6000 mah battery that's good actually. Design could have been better though.
6. Camera: The camera is good but it could have been great. The images don't look punchier. I think software update should fix this.
7. User interface: Its awesome as always.

Overall a great phone at this price but camera could be improved in next software update.
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars

No doubt best in this price. Battery backup super. Camera quality good. Display and touch are very super. Phone appearance should be improved. Few software updates are to be added. Hope Samsung will do it in future. Whatever may be price range, but back cover should be given to use the phone once it delivered.
Now only Samsung started to competite with Chinese phones. Ofcourse it's late, but healthy  competitor

Camera quality is very poor not at all a 48MP quality. Image blurs out when zoomed in even 2x. The only reason I have liked this phone is because of its monster battery. Extensive usage of watching video online still the phone manages to run for 1.5days without charging. Regular use  battery life is easily 2days

For the price, Samsung has offered a lot !
I got the pearl white variant and it looks great
The phone is overall smooth.

The camera pictures are okay ( not the best in class ) but for the price it's worth it.
The super steady mode is amazing but lacks quality and it is a little grainy but not bad.
The performance is great.
There are several new features compared to the older Samsung phones ( A series and M series )
For example there is "Lift to wake" which is a feature I personally love.
The build is okay.
The display is the best part of the phone because of the super amoled screen.

To conclude :
It is totally worth the buy !

This phone is magic, massive 6000mah battery and weight management is awesome for such a huge battery.
Pros
6.4inch super amoled picture quality no competition
6000mah battery last for 2days
Exynos 9611 best in class.
Good gaming performance
Good camera in outdoor condition and indoor condition in day
Good ram management
Best budget smartphone
You may think there are other brands with more specs but samsung is reliable, robust.

Cons
Camera could have been better in indoor  condition. Stability needed in video recording.

Samsung UI over rides the Android features causing duplication of apps. Eg. Google Keyboard has to be installed and if one doesnt want to use the Samsung Keyboard, Google Contacts has to be installed and then Samsung Contacts have to be synced with Google etc.

I bought this primarily because it has AMOLED screen. The TV shows are fantastic on this phone. Also, the brand value of Samsung automatically means a very high quality product. I have always owned Samsung phones. I am a Samsung loyalist and when I saw that it has AMOLED screen I immediately put in the order.

If you play a lot of games, go for some other phone. It has low ram and processor. But for watching videos and movies, at this price range, it is a fantastic phone.

Review Edit after ~20 days: Fingerprint sensor seems bad now. Does not recognize my finger properly anymore. Tried to re-register with same results. Only have 10% success rate. Might need to get it checked from warranty claim.
:(

END EDIT.

Nice phone. I wish the fingerprint sensor was a more leveled because it is difficult to detect it properly on first try.
But it is very worth it at the net price of 11,600.

I was looking for a good phone within the budget for quite some time. I was amazed with this offer.  Now-a-days everyone looks for the longest battery life, since most of us use our phones much more than the laptop and Samsung has done their best !!  Samsung always stands out for the improvisation of their products. A perfect phone in every aspect, with the maximum options and reasonably priced. Thanks to the Amazon team for thinking from the customer point of view and making it affordable to every common man..  Well done !

After using one week i can say it's camara is not of 48 MP Quality  camera quality is not up to the mark my Asus zenfone Max Pro 1 has better camera then this mobile company claims of 48 megapixels but it's only 12 megapixels and sometime camera  takes longer time duration to catch picture even processor speed is too slow and because of that you cannot load more pictures in any application only battery life is better I think if you have better option please don't go for it

Dont fall for china mobiles with high radiation... Very nice mobile..13999 selling price, got 1400 discount with SBI card, received 1000 Rs Amazon balance, booked rice cooker for my mother.  So effective price for my mobile was 11600 at NO COST EMI.

PROS
Brand value...will get good after sales service
Battery life
Screen quality
Look and feel.
Good weight distribution.
Night mode.
Fast face unlock and fingerprint

Cons
I bought black color and finger prints are easily visible after few hours of usage.  Need to use a case as many of us do....Case is must to protect the camera module also.

Nothing much to criticize, just go for it..Finally I don't play games on mobile, so can't give my verdict on it.. It is a paisa vasool deal for me... forget about features and all.. just super amoled screen is enough..

After two months review:

Lucky to wait for this mobile.. Monster.

The phone looks good and in this price bracket, gives you the best Brand presence compared to others...
Everything seems okay, just that I feel the fingerprint sensor could have been faster like my previous Honor 9i phone...
Screen response time is higher and a little sluggish at times...
I have to press off button at least 2 times to turn off/Disconnect a call... some people tells me its a software glitch that all Android phones are facing these days...
Well then someone should work on it, because it is very irritating...
Battery life is amazing... 5 stars to that...
Connectivity is great.
Sound quality is the best so far I had come across.
Camera is also good and feels adequate for daily use... Very Quick and no lags at all.
I was expecting 6GB to be superfast, but it works like any other normal phone.
No hang ups or software issues faced so far...
Definitely a good buy in this price bracket and definitely feels more upmarket than any popular chinese brand...

1. Battery backup is awesome. More than 30 hours of usage with continuous internet operation.
2. Fast charging is not available despite having an option. It takes more than 2.30 hours to completely charge the battery fully.
3. Display quality is awesome with the AMOLED screen.
4. The phone is fast enough to play big size games.
5. With the available price, the camera quality is OK. It can be better.
6.  The phone is not getting heated after continuous usage.
7. Good and stylish look. It feels awesome to use this mobile without any back cover.
8. Very fast response os biometrics and security like face recognition, fingerprint etc.

First thanks to Amazon for its fast delivery.. and phone is awesome... From samsung at this price. With 6000 mah battery it is feels light. One thing to note that its charging cable is too short and lower quality. Camera quality is good not best.One ui is great but some features is missing like app lock, s bike mode . Overall it is a value for money smartphone.

Thanks Samsung for launching such a nice version of mobile. Really feel good to use M30S as its give feeling of using Samsung note 8, note 10 experience. Camera is one of the best megapixels and far better in comparison to oppo and  mi phone. I hope current processor will last longer and it will not hang the mobile. Overall satisfied with look and quality of product and that is also only at 17k price.
I recommend every one to buy M30s and save money by not buying costlier mobile and become tension free.
One change I will suggest to keep volume button on left side as it's always more convenient to use.
Anyway I can able to give 99 Mark's out of 100 based on current position and brand name of Samsung in market.
Wish you all the best and thanks for launching such a great product.

Giving a rating first time in my lifetime, so hopefully you cam imagine my disappointment..
1. Camera quality. Config. 43 MP, it does not even come closer compared to 12 MP of other standard mobiles
2. Battery life/charging duration : Interestingly, being 6K MAH capacity, it takes minimum of 4 hours to charge even with fast charge option &amp; also it drains out in 12 hours of usage
3. Screen experience is not up-to the mark, does not work smoothly
4. It heats up like a burning coal even with a 45 minute usage of web based/internet based applications
5. From plays store most of the times it gets stuck to download any application (even most commonly used applications such as BMS, Cricbuzz,Paytm,etc)

Nothing more to say..it's up to you to go for it or not..

Camera is normal as any mobile have in these days..so 3 star for camera ..expected great camera as they say 48 mp 🤣..
Battry is better or more than better but not best as it is 6000 it works like 4500 or 5000..i think only my mobile has problem charge slow than i saw in yt video..
Processor is beast in this price ..
And i cant put memory card in it...specially memory card is of samsung 🤣..and memory is fine...problem is with this phone..space problem in slot
Overall great in 14k but samsung showed this phone like king but its not

The cellphone is a significant upgrade to M30 the USP of the phone is 6000 MaH battery which lasts longer than 26 hrs.
4gb 64gb variant is more than enough for users with basic gaming and cell phone needs.
M30s triple camera is a powerful one equipped with AR Emoji feature which is a good one to have fun with.
Several features like super slo mo and super steady makes this cell phone stand out from the others.
Would recommend everyone to go for this if you want to buy a excellent cell phone with all the new features introduced in 2019.

So here is my point of view regarding the handset. Quite satisfied as of now. Yes 6000MAH battery shows its magic. Camera quality is decent. Detailing of pix may not satisfy you as  they claimed its 48 mp, but at the same time wide angle is satisfactory. Didn't face any lagging or hanging issue. There are lot of features to customize in phone, like your own memoji, layout of keypad,app window and notifications, night mode etc. Amoled display makes it go very smooth. Not quite satisfied with finger sensor as even a mild sweat layer can fail to unlock the phone. Didn't play very heavy games but have used phone for hours and heating is normal. Overall a good handset in  budget, even if you're not a samsung lover, you will love the phone in this budget.

am satisfied with this mobile
1. Battery life awesome as expectation and fast charging also good.
2. Camera is good especially slow motion ultimate and night time might be different but am not a photo lover so am ok with this camera flashlight white color😍.
3. Perfomance too good 6GB ram 👏with 128 inbuilt👏👏 dual sim volte 😋😋😍 and dedicated memory card😍.
4. Price is too moderate because of cross cutting.  samsung pay and NFC not available that not gonna big impact because no one using that porperly.

See this mobile fulfilled my expectation so if ur expecting long battery life with moderate camera and dedicated memory card with 128gb inbuilt blindly go for it👍

Most impartant, call recieving pics made worst.  User has to put in extra efforts to push call button to a longer distance across or diagonally.

Camera usage is also made complex with more options without app symbols,
User manual enclosed with set  is very much incomplete causing hardship for initial usage. Though, it is in settings, it can not be accessed without internet,

Worth every penny,
I am not Samsung  fan, last 4 mobiles I used  Redmi mobiles
But this time Samsung wins

 fingerprint reader is fast...

Camera quality is superb in day light .. The greatest feature in camera is night mod... Works like magic...  But in low light camera is not so good... Super slow motion, super steady features are best... Video quality in 4k

Super amoled display Is great

One UI give flagship level experience, all features are 👌🏻

6000Mah battery with fast charger

What you expect in 14k mobile...

Its surprisingly best 🔥

Hope Samsung can solve low light camera problem in future update

6gb 128gb version delivered on 29th. Costed 14,200/- after discounts and cashback. Good display and battery, holds nicely in hand. But battery heats up when using heavy apps. It also drains up in a day of moderate usage. Plastic body, average camera. Single speaker gives below average sound and mediocre performance. Not sure about durability. Just an average phone from Samsung.  Amazon didn't accept my return request. Seems their policy have changed. So check return policy thoroughly when you buy electronic items any more. I'm ok this time as I need a second phone and I didn't pay a bomb.

Excellent performance.  Buttery smooth performance. Never hang like old Samsung Galaxy devices. Performance: 8.5 to 9 out of 10. (As per price point and Samsung brand).

Excellent display quality. Watching videos are giving amazing experience.  I don't see any pixelation during watching videos/ viewing images/ reading pdf documents etc
Score: 10 out of 10.

Sound quality: Above average.  Sound is loud, crisp &amp; clear.  DOLBY works definitely.  Watching YouTube, Netflix etc gives pleasure.  You Never disappoint about sound quality.
Score: 8 out of 10.

Call sound quality/ Network reception: one word_ Excellent. You can hear the other person clearly even if you are in market places.
Score: 9.5 out of 10.

camera
(a) Front: above average. 6 out of 10
Not for hardcore selfies persons.
(b) Rear: a little more more than above Average. 7 out of 10. You can take a good picture in day light or even in low light. Videos stabilization is Excellent. But if you are a professional photographer,  it is not for you.

Design: Average. 6 out of 10. Not so heavy ONLY 189 g. Not a bulky handset even it has 6000mAh battery.

Finger print: Above average 7.5 out of 10. Accurate but little bit slow.

Battery: just one word; EXCELLENT 9.0 to10 OUT OF 10. Give one and a half day backup easily.

Software: Excellent.  Far far far better than color os 6.0; miui 10 or 11; fun touch os, honor or huwaei OS. Samsung one UI is very smooth and responsive. Dark mode is available and it is definitely better than redmi realme honor vivo oppo like brands. But it is not better than OXYGEN OS. One hand mode is very important for me and many of you. It is available in m30s.

Gaming performance: Sorry I am not a hardcore gamer. I play only temple run; some light racing games and PubG in default settings. It can handle all types of thesegames easily without any frame drop.

Typing: On screen keyboard is very very responsive and also best suited for big hand man.

Heating issues: Normal! Absolutely normal. Heating around earpieces if you have used it more 1 hr continuously. But it is absolutely normal.
Final verdict: if your priorities are multimedia like YouTube netflix etc &amp; listings a lot of music in Excellent Excellent sound; handling social sites like FB, WhatsApp, instagram etc, emailing,  browsing internet heavily, playing light games and taking some pictures, selfies etc; IT IS THE BEST DEAL FOR YOU AS PER PRICE POINT UNDER 15K WITH REPUTED BRAND.

I'm trying my best to review my Samsung Galaxy m30s.
This review is based on my more than 20 days usage of this device. Opal black color is  attractive and my favorite.
SPIGEN COVER IS THE BEST BACK COVER FOR ITS PROTECTION.

You can install any good quality tempered glass from your nearby local market.

Thanks for viewing. Like if you agree with my opinion.

Selfie camera quality is not good. Facing heating problems  within 5 minute while using phone. You can cook a egg amlate on top of this mobile because this phone is like a fry pane. I am very disappointed to buy this phone because front camera quality is not so good.

I would easily suggest Samsung Galaxy M30s to any person who is looking for a budget mobile phone with great battery capacity and incredible processing speed.
I've been using it for a week and it's a great phone to consider if you are a business person or a techie who likes to work continuously on their phone every day. Some people may not agree with me totally since they consider the iPhone to be the phone for professionals but if you compare this with the iPhone, this guy can keep up for sure.
I would highly recommend it to anyone. Just go for it, You won't regret it.

It is fantastic phone and use of three weeks and I find that the battery life optimum and could use for two day randomly.  Camera is owsome and have great feature.
Sorry for previous review.

It is a average phone and could get better phone in same price from Vivo, Oppo and Oneplus.  It is hardly a smart phone.  It does not proper to be a smart phone. Battery life short and drained even it is not used NOT UPTO MARK of 6000 mAH.

Worst product ...battery draining is very fast .. more than 287 preloaded apps/phone settings which are highly RAM consuming everytime and always asks to permissions to access your personal information &amp; data..the 6000mah monster battery just a worst slogan...return policy is very poor...don't buy this phone at any cost ... they're enforcing to retain this worst product instead of refunds..

I have been using the phone since over a month now and major issue with the phone is that it has Network reception issues, which makes this phone waste of your money. My 4G SIM was giving decent network speed on my earlier phone. Since I started using the M30s, my network speed has drastically reduced and most of the time, I am unable to browse basic webpages, let alone play video/audio. Camera quality/performance  in low light/ night condition is very bad. Also the processor performance is inferior to SD platform processors and feels like a Mediatek platform processor. In short, think twice before buying.

So after using 5 days I can say Samsung is doing great job especially with the budget category.

With A super amoled FHDplus screen your video experiences is at high level .
Camera with A 48 MP is just awesome . whether you take photos in daylight or even gives a good performance in night aslo .there are lots of features in camera department likes super steady video recording or super slow motion or wide angle lense .as you know Samsung's camera is always great when it comes to detailing.so for camera I will give 5 on 5.
Now battery performance is just great I can say beast in battery with 6000 Mah battery power you phone easily lasts for near about 2 days .
And earlier there is a issue with budget phone of Samsung as the weak processors but this time Samsung did a great job by providing 9611 series processor which can handles your daily multi tasking job easily.besies it can gives a options to play pubg in hd graphics but with smooth graphic is recommended.Nd the Ram management is just awesome and great that's why it gives the snappy usages .more over it's oneUI is so much optimised that Many apps are in Ram .So for Ram management Samsung OneUI is just great.
But there are always some cons .So finger print and faceunlock are a little bit slow but accurate  so hope to get it resolved by updates.
And last but least why I choose Samsung over Redmi Note 8 pro because of Samsung brand value because of Samsung's after sales services and a lots of things like Super amoled screen a Massive battery a better UI than mi UI a better Ram management and a better optimised UI . moreover it's performance is also great but not for pubg lover but for daily usage lovers .
So here I covered allmost most of the points that we should consider when we are about to buy this phone .so my honest

Every once in a while we come across a faulty model, even in the best of brands. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE FAULTY MODEL.
High specs on paper but worse than a low grade phone.
Samsung may have marketed it well, along with a few good reviews but don't get fooled by it.
Bad camera, Bad battery, Bad build quality, not so good processing, takes forever to charge and the list goes on;
Thanks for reading and upvoting the review.

I have owned several brands since 1999 from pencil box shaped nokia and samsung phones to the fancy iphone X, but the M30 is by far the best purchase. The quality of features you get for the money is unbelievable.  Highly recommend this phone.

Pros
Display quality and big screen
Battery life
Camera

Cons
Just a little lag but nothing significant

Just go for it

Didn't even let me do initial bootup and serup. Hung in the checking for updates screen. Contacted Samsung customer care. They told it needa service center visit. Pathetic! Stay away from Samsung. Only Big name quality is 0. I have asked for replacement from Amazon. Now Amazon is telling wait till our technician comes and inspects. As if he will do what Samsung couldnt do!

This is my view about the product.
Appearance: good ,compact and lightweight.
Camera : quality of the picture is awesome.both rear(triple cam) and front cam pictures are good.
Sound: can be better
Processing speed and navigation: smooth and fast
Memory capacity: I think it will be enough for normal users, I mean people having few necessary applications . Separate slot for memory card needs to be appreciated.
Battery : once charged fully it comes for more than a day
Fingerprint reader is the another feature available in m30 which still now available  only on few phones.

Hey Samsung M30S,

What a product you have build. Simply jaw dropping configuration!

Its been two weeks I m using this device and it has nailed in all section. Battery is really huge provide back up of 2days with heavy use.

M30S Screen is amazing. Crystal clear resolution. My gaming experience has chi changed a lot.

Processor is also amazing. No lag even after simultaneously accesing many applications.

Last thing is its  Camera, wide and ultra wide lense works perfectly. Depth effect is also amazing.

I m in love with this device😍

AMOLED HD+ Gorilla glass 3 ( Amazon site Q&amp;A), 10nm processor UFS 2.1 48 MP triple cameras 16MP front camera, We have to learn little about camera modes thats it. 6000Mah battery and Samsung brand.  Very less head SAR value(0,468)W/kg. One UI is very user friendly As per my review this is very good specs and built.  Any bugs reported will be fixed in next update.  Thanks to Samsung for such wonderful  device.  Amazon great service.

This phone is currently not supporting LTE+, no Career Aggregation and using only band 3 on Jio, hence very low lte data speeds. Also Front camera is performing very bad, no sharpness at all, feels like a 2mp camera.

These can be fixed via software updates, but until &amp; unless samsung fixes this, this phone should be avoided.

Battery &amp; Performance is good, Speaker sound is average.

If media consumption is your priority then Go For it without giving any second thought.

Pros:
1. Display- the full hd+ SAMOLED screen is the best screen you can get at this price range. It's a flagship Grade screen. Trust me you will get the best media consumption experience with this phone.( Generally majority of our usage is media consumption.)

2. Wideone L1 support- if you watch Netflix and Amazon prime this phone is a pleasant deligh. You will get the best experience of watching the movies and web series.

3.Battery life- it has a monster giant 6000 mAh battery. Which will last you for at least three days of average usage. You will never have to worry about running out of juice again.

4. Cameras- It has a pretty decent 48MP primary  sensor, which will satisfy all of your photography needs.
Selfie camera is also great for taking selfies. Sharp and clear.

Cons:

1.Build- the plastic body is not that much of a con(it will never shatter if you drop it). We all put on a sturdy phone case anyway. So plastic build is not an issue to worry about if you just put on a sturdy phone case. 🙂🙂

Verdict:
It is a good phone with the best media consumption experience at this price range. If watching videos and social media is your priority go for it, you will for sure have the best experience. And if you are a person who is always on the go for your busy job 6000mAh battery is for you.
It is the best phone to GIFT TO YOUR PARENTS, they will be nothing but satisfied.

I have been searching through various websites and reviews to buy a mobile in these festive sale I found this in my budget.my priorities are camera and battery.This phone makes me happy in respect of both camera and battery. As an additional advantage performance is too good at this price. I cannot write in depth review about camera as I am novice user,but this phone produces good pictures and video is having image stabilisation

Battery draining phone like my 5 year old galaxy J7. System OS is draining the battery drastically. Out of 6 GB RAM 4 HAS BEEN Consumed by the phone . Now it is 1.9 GB only RAM free/available.

6000 mAh Battery not backup 24 hrs.
Home service don't inspect the phone actually and updated that phone is ok. So no return or replace option for battery back-up. Only home service for formality.

Works like a charm, as per description. Battery is the real good part. Full marks. Very less battery drainage. Works for normal phone and web usage for about one and a half to two days without charging. The processor is quite fast. Further, the mobile is easier to hold since it has been reduced in its width over its predecessors. That is a big plus point. The camera has a wide angle format. So photos clicked are not bloated. Screen colours are rich. Features in the software are quite a lot. I doubt whether most of the people even know about them or would even attempt to use them. A good but.

My phone restarts automatically even when my Auto-Restart option is turned off. At times twice a day, at times twice a week. I've found the same goes with other phones across the globe and not sure if Samsung is doing anything or not. Did not help me with my issue.

Useful:
1. Camera quality is awesome it’s better than Iphone7. I am using Iphone7, I find Samsung camera of 48mp is great
2. Finger print detection also faster and detect even with sweat, which is good compare to IPhone 7
3. Battery: management is poor. iPhone developers are great in terms of power management. 2800maH battery last longer than 6000mAH. Without using just kept in standby within hour, 40% battery power reduces.
4. Charging cable is too short compare to other mobile. It’s says fast charging, but time takes as normal charging speed.

Writing this review after ten days of usage. This model M30s is true to its name, a real monster. Coming to its performance
1. Battery stays alive for two days. And to charge it completely it takes about 1 and half to two hours.
2. Finger print reader is very good, though it is in the back side.
3. Camera is really good. If you are someone who experiment with photography, then there are lot of options in this mobile.
4. Processor is really good.
Final verdict, it's a complete package for less than 17k. Best buy. Thanks Amazon for timely and prompt delivery.

Pros
Smooth UI and Performance
Excellent Daylight Camera
Battery
Size is comfortable even being 6.4 inch
Volume is loud and clear on speakers, dolby atmos in headsets

Cons
Low Light Camera is average (fair enough at this price segment)
No Indicator Light (was used to it in previous phone)
Slow image saving at 48MP resolution, takes 3 second at least.

Neither Pros and Cons
Too big battery makes it feel like slow charging even being fast enough.
Image size at 48MP is ~16MB.

Superb quality of product by samsung. Camera quality awesome. Speed performance is too good. Storage wise 48 mega pixels pictures are taking more space but who cares this is comes with 128 gb out of which 118 are usable so it's more than enough. Sound quality is good. Screen sensors are highly active and sensitive. It's really nice phone in budgeted segment. It looks really cool and rich when it's in your hand. Must buy phone. ALARM IS NOT WORKING. IT WORKS ONLY WHEN THE PHONE IS ON BUT ITS NOT WORKING WHEN IT'S SWITCHED OFF.

The phone cound have been better in terms of its software and OS .The feel is worst than than moto X4 and its really ordinary outline from software prospective . The phone has a better battery life and screen is better than most of other brand , still there is lot of improvement can be done from Samsung. Customers expect more than this . Camera is ok and delivered few of best photos . Memory mechanism is somewhat complicated ..

Bought it for my mom who needs just camera for her business purpose and long battery life.
This phone definitely serves that purpose and my mom has no complains.

But I have noticed that the signal reception is a bit weak. Calls are clear but signal reception is weak. Also the camera color is a bit washed. I need to increase the saturation. I think both can be fixed by a simple software update.

The plastic cover is a bit creaky. My mother uses a back cover so it doesn't matter.

Overall the camera is great and I liked the product.

I have not tried any games.

I rate the phone model Samsung M30 S as five star.

The display screen is really great, what Samsung stands for. All my praise for it.

However, I've following suggestions :

The battery is enough only for one day.

The call log isn't upto my expectations. If I wish to send message using WhatsApp or so, I have to go to the phonebook details. Also, in Samsung phone-book format, there's still room for improvements.

In the gallery, the "default photo editor" isn't at par with that in other phones of same monetary range.

The scientific calculator is also not good. It works only in landscape mode. I've resorted to  " Hiper Scientific Calculator."

There could be notification light in the chin margin.

The weather widget primarily highlights the temperature. What if one emphasizes on the hour of the day?

Always on Display : It takes noticeable efforts to display the "Always on Display"  clock. Also, the clock style should have more ( and bold ) variations.

Even the calendar App needs improvements as it couldn't appeal to me. I've gone back to "Google Calendar" .

I'm finding it difficult to use the "finger sensor " for only waking up the screen by touching it.

For screen shots, why Samsung always prefer palmn- swap? Why not an option for three fingers swap ? Palm swap takes more time as compared to three fingers swap and not convenient either.

Also when the phone is in lock screen mode, why can't we take a screenshot of the photos shown by the Glance App ? My previous phone set had this option.

I feel Samsung may plan for a finger sensor ( 30 mm x 30 mm on the back side ) akin to the mouse-pad in laptops. It can work wonders as there won't be any hindrance while watching videos.

However, my ratings remain five star for Samsung M30 S .

I bought this phone three days ago. The battery is just insane. Even the Weight of phone is less. We need to appreciate Samsung for this. I played heavy games like pubg, call of duty etc. And it consumed only 7 %of the battery 🔋 for just 1hour play . The games go smooth with out any heating up of phone. The sound is also louder. Coming to camera the back is of 48MP and I am luving it I am sharing few photos that I have taken on this phone. But the front comes with 16mp cemara which is a drawback for selfie lowers. Even the fingerprint is sometimes slower.
But the overall experience of the phone 📱 is gud. The overall value for money is 9 out of 10(according to me 😊).

Amazing battery life. I don't know how fingerprint reader works. I haven't done fingerprint settings but my earlier Mi would unlock if I touched the fingerprint reader (even without settings). Howver I am happy with double tapping screen to unlock it. The glance part on lock screen is a bit annoying and I don't k ow how to remove it. Overall great product and excellent value for money.

Great value for money phone from Samsung. There may be other phones from realme &amp; xiaomi with similar specs but no match to M30s battery &amp; display, and a flagship experience due to one UI of Samsung. Guys this is Samsung near flagship experience at such low price, cannot be compared with chinese phones, even if they provide better specs.

Have used for less than a month only. So far so good. Budget high end phone. No heating even after intensive  usage. Got it for about 11500. Finger print reader is good, no matter how much u use a fully charged battery of this phone will last for more than a day, camera is just awesome.  Very happy thus far. Let's see the durability. Thax to Amazon

Simply superb.
1.  Amazing battery.  I got to charge the phone once in 2 days.  The battery discharges very slow even with multiple apps running in background.  Battery doesn't get heated up even with 2 hours of usage.
2.  Camera is a wonder.  48 MP under 15k is unbelievable.  Picture quality is very good.  Front is 16 MP, which is good too.
3.  4 GB Ram, the phone doesn't lag anywhere .
4.  Build quality is good and super AMOLED display, watching movies in theatre quality.
5.  Best budget phone under 15k also always on display, which I love in this phone.
Go for it guys.

6000 mAh battery doesn't work well, full charged phone gets discharge after 18 hours when internet is on and the camera quality as said monstrous but not up to the mark , worst front camera while using the (Snapchat,WhatsApp,Instagram) it opens in full screen and distort the pixels and looks like a 5 MP camera, body is good but there are loose sides when you press the Sides of screen, taking about 6 GB ram not worth it half of it used by OS and phone got lagged for the first time while opened the oldest WhatsApp message from a conversation and in this price range it's good to buy but don't if you are a heavy user and never tried games so this is it after using it for 4 days

First ,amazon delivery: amazing
Now ,the product is one of the best i have used . This phone will give you a permium feel in budget section. I have bought the 6/128 and i cant be more happy.
Display: awesome
Processer: excellent
Camera : superb in its segment
Battery: monster, humongous ,wow. Easily goes upto one and half day on a full charge even after extensive use.
Other features like fingure print scanne, face recognition are superbly fast.
All in all people who want a phone with good camera, good battery, good performance, and do not want to go with brands like MI , Huawei , or any other Chinese  brand, samsung has an answer for you and thats M30s.

Awesome delivery by Amazon very next day of the order I got it.

At this price this is a best buy with brand.

Camera quality 48mp is really good.

Fingerprint reader is really awesome.

Battery life I m yet to check it precisely, but I m getting more than a day charge with calls and music while i travel.

It would've been better if samsung provided tempered glass and a basic back cover as these aren't available in box or out anywhere as this is new model. Because, the mobile is sleek, light weight and the backpanel is so smooth that it might slip.

Dolby atmos is enabled only for headphone and bluetooth headsets which encourages to buy headphones which isn't available in box.

128 GB space and 6 GB ram is another advantage to make this mobile powerful.

Got the phone during sales, including card discount and pay balance i just had to pay just  14299. On top of that I exchanged my old phone and got the phone at a real good price.

Coming to specs:
Appearance: I got the white one and it feels premium, you might have to add a back cover as it's little slippery. You won't miss the 3.5mm jack, but it could have been better placed on the top rather than bottom. I personally don't like hybrid SIM slots, thankfully this one has dual SIM slot and a memory card slot. Camera positioning and panel looks cool.

3.5 mm headphone is there, Dolby effects are good, try with a good quality headset. Sound is loud enough with external speaker.

Screen: Samsung screens are bright and vibrant, Color is lively and vivid. Night mode and premium features like always on display adds charm to the fluid UI.Decent screen to body ratio, the sAmoled screen gives you the look and feel of flagship, my rating 5/5

Battery: thats 6k we all know, it lasts 2 days with medium usage for me. The processer, bright screen consumes more than the previous m30 model but 6k may serves what is intended. I expected Samsung to provide provide 20 w charger considering the huge battery, the inbox 15 watt charger takes roughly 2.5 hours to fill the battery completely. I can see people complaining about battery charging time but remember you are charging a 6000 mah and not a 3700mah.
My rating 5/5, 15 w charger is not bad at this price range and I am okay if the phone goes on for 2 days at cost of 150 min charge.

Camera: very good for day photography and outdoor shots. Ultra wide angle and super slow motion modes are awesome.
Night mode works decent but not much impressive. Video recording is great with enhanced stabilizer. Over all decent camera at this price range. Front camera is decent enough for selfies, wide angle is great to have again. I have shared few indoor, outdoor pictures Captured for reference. 4/5

Security: on screen finger print sensor will be missed but face unlock covers that upto some extent. Witha decent back cover the finger print sensor is ease to access. Both finger print and face unlock works fluidly. My rating, 4/5.deducting a point for missing on screen finger front sensor which could have been added on sAmoled display.

System OS and interface: it's android pie out of box with aug 2019 security patch. I was never a fan of Samsung os but so far amazed with the performance and fluidity. Not faced any heating problem so far, even after continuous 2 hous usage and video play. It would be great to see when Samsung rolls out android 10 update for this one, looking at the popularity I don't think they are going to delay it. The processer supports the operating system well, graphics randering is smooth like butter. I will rate 4.5/5

Value for money: Samsung is surely going to disrupt this mid budget market segment with m30s which is majorly dominated by realme, redmi, honor etc.. I have used M40, A50 which are good phones with similar specs but I will rate this phone much above both of them in terms of value for money. My rating 5/5

Worst phone with radiation problem. I went to customer service and told them radiation issue and they just upgraded/updated software and again same issue. They don't have any equipment to measure the radiation from the phone. Again I went to customer service today(17/11/2019 sunday) informed the radiation issue and they said technical person will come on Monday and asked me to drop the phone, which I did and by the time I reached home trouble ticket closed without doing any radiation check. This is the Samsung customer service in
chaitanyapuri/Dilsukh nagar, Hyderabad. They still have my mobile phone with them.

Main thing which i considered while burying this phone camara and battery. I had been using since 1 day. Camara is not actually look like 48mp texture of the photos look like old phone photos and it doesn't feel like pro camera i had compared with this phone to redmi note 5 pro which has far better  than this camara. Battery was good but phone heats up on top of the portion i don't know why!! Coming to the privacy part there is no inbuilt  app lock and notification hide feature  which is a big drawback for me you can't  hide notifications while you or someone using your phone if you really want to buy the phone for Camara  it is better to not to buy this. on 15k you go for different options. Lastly overall experience  with this phone is mixed one!

Battery draining vey fast. Gaming is very very awesome. Exynos you are rocking. Camera quality is very good for macro shots. I added some of mine  taken. But as compared to 48 mp it deteriorates the quality on zooming. One very impressive thing is one ui. I love so much one ui and the security patch updated within 15 days. Talking about selfies...ya it performs well in daylight as well artificial lighting conditions. And again I would like to tell you exynos... really rocking processor. The super amoled screen also performing very well I m using my phone with screen guard and I m getting option of screen sensitivity, but guys without using that option my touch is like मक्खन ke jaisa chalta hai boss. All premium features are available here. Just go for it.

The Samsung Galaxy M30s can be seen as an upgrade over the existing Galaxy M30. It retains its predecessor's good attributes, such as the crisp AMOLED display, and bumps the battery capacity up to 6,000mAh which helps deliver better battery life. The new Exynos 9611 SoC is more powerful than the Exynos 7904, and offers similar levels of performance as other popular processors at the same price point in the market.

The cameras on the M30s are one area in which Samsung still needs to put in some work. We often found focusing to be slow, and the camera performance in low light was below average.

If battery life ranks very high on your priority list, then you should consider the Galaxy M30s.

It hangs so much that i am already selling it at half price just to get rid of it. Please Samsung dont sell such poor quality Products. Better go for Redmi note 8.

The phone when received had tag mentioned on it that this product only work on Indian Sim. This information was never displayed while purchasing the phone.

The worst part when you ask Amazon customer that why this was not mentioned it was said that you should have researched on Samsung site which is ridiculous.

Baterry Started Draining Fastly from Day 1, Very bad, Not expected from Amazon &amp; Samsung aswell, Kindly dont buy this mobile,
Bcoz this is a flop model of samsung, This is the reason why Company is giving the offer, So that they can sell it off easily. Particularly Dont Believe Amazon Star Ratings As these r Fake Ratings, To sell it off the product Easily.

Great phone...
Huge battery life...
Smooth performance...
Good cameras...
Optimal sound quality...
Awesome display...
Premium Software
Ufs 2.1

Albeit...
No ambient light sensor,auto brightness uses front camera which drains battery.
No screen protection.
Only 15W fast charge..

But all in all one of the best value for money phone.

Just great,love it so much,thanks to Samsung.battery life astonishing, it lasted for four full days(I was testing shelf life of  battery, minimum use).fingerprint is good,fast,it adapts for speed. Camera quality good,other brands we use in our home is over exposed,some color is patchy, but I like to be natural whether its beautiful or not.i like animation, it stands up to other phones in a better way.thanks Samsung, you are back in business.  .

Im a light mobile user. Earlier I used a refurbished moto G5 for 3 years. I use phone for calls, sms, whatsapp and couple of apps like OLA etc. I bought this mobile only because of the battery life. Indeed I didnt even bother to check the camera specs before buying it. My pros and cons after using it for a couple of weeks.
Pros:
1. I charged the mobile to 100% on october-3rd and using it lightly the charged lasted till october-10th. Now im using it medium heavy inorder to check the battery life and the charge stays for 4 days.. So I assume for heavy user it should last 2 to 3 days.. So full marks for the battery.
2. Options in the camera are pretty good.
3. Display is awesome.
4. Other options are pretty much good or same as that of other mobile in same category.
5. call clarity is also good.
6. Dolby atmos option is a nice feature.
7. Bought for 12,500 with discounts provided.
8. 1 year display glass warranty from acko..I guess its not available now.

Cons:
1. Phone hangs rarely.
2. No headphones provided.

Good phone for this price and brand.

An amazing phone in this range....just loved it
• The qulity of samsung display is awsome as usuall
• performance is awesome....no lags....samsung ui is awesome for now.....PUBG no lag at all at hd settings only few frame drops
• face unlock very fast just issue is it opens with closed eyes to...for this i think could be resolved by a update or so....
• physical finger scanner is way to fast...these in screen and way to slow ..i own a A70 and  a A50 but fringerprint scanner too slow almost 30 sec
• i love the back camera its pretty good , but front lacks some details and clearity but rear camera is awesome
Thats preetty much it... good phone worth buying in this price range...just go for it.

Screen display is bit yellowish,  but that can be easily changed by correcting the white balance and display mode in display settings. After this,  screen feels pretty cool because of its AMOLED display.
Speaker is awesome.

Finger print scanner is very slow after using for 2 days. Face recognition is also unreliable. Which is very disappointing. Because of this I do not recommend to others.

Ordered on Sep 29 as a prime member. Tried 28 this itself to order. Delivered on Oct 2.
Searched many phones for long and decided to go with this. Updating my review here after 1 month usage on Nov 8th. Only finger sensor fails often. But ok

My ratings below
Display is superb - 100+ I can give 200%.
Automatic adjustment is there. ok  but can be improved
Built Quality (Plastic) but good with extra cover - 90
Style &amp; Color (Sapphire Blue) - 90
Speaker 90 (while watching film upto95 range is average but if set to full volume, its too high)
Size Length ok but width less (but compact) - 90
Performance (like mails ticket booking .. basic activites. Very good processor 9611) - 100

Battery Good  - 95
Observed ormal heating bcaz 5000+ capacity and fast charging. In few minutes getting cool. Charge kept for 1.5 days if we use often else usable for 2 days surely.

Many apps installed but can control ourselves.

Touch is awesome: 100
Value for Money : 100% more than that.

Camera : 80 Live focus good.
Samsung is best but few things to be improved. Obviously good at this cost. Very few things only to be compromised bcaz bought it on my own interest.

Kept in mind that samsung service center located everywhere and mobiles covers everywhere. So good choice for me.

With prime delivery phone was delivered next day with good  packaging. Following are the pros and cons of the phone
Pro
With this price the phone is awesome.
Amazon also offering exchange of old mobile with good exchange rate
Looks and features of M30s are mind blowing. Setup of phone is very easy and options of each feature are so many that personalization is near 100%. Camera is very good and photos are vivid. However I have not clicked photos in low light yet.
Cons
No earphones and no screengaurd with phone
Overall I am fully satisfied.

After 2 days of usage (6 &amp; 128 GB):

Battery : 6000mah is just a count.
Camera : other budget phone cameras are
awsome compared to m 30s,  48MP is just a count, no use of  camera.(I was the fan of samsung - note3,note8,s7 edge &amp; finally m 30s.
Value for money : not sure in recommend(when compared to other brands).
Performance : average(but best in budget phones).
Finger print : lagging in recognition
Face unlock : good.
Device look : worst(can customize with back covers or full body covers).

I recently bought Realme XT(8 &amp; 128GB),used it for 10 days &amp; finally sold it back just to buy samsung M 30s but finally disappointed.

But finally partially sarisfied.

1. This phone is getting heating issue while speaking for more than 3 min and my ear getting pain--&gt; this is not at all expected from Samsung. seldom --&gt; my old phone Redmi Note5 Pro is changed because of this issue and i am having same issue with this also. NOT at all Happy .
2. Heating issue while multi functioning
3. I am using both SIMs. the signal strength is showing as weak almost all the time. But i have checked in other handsets used by colleagues in office and neighbors at home, and their phone showing full signal (SIMs are from same service provider) and no data interruption. with this my take away is, Antenna in this phone is looks to be weak --&gt; I am not at all happy with this
4. my previous phone Redmi Note5 Pro is having much better performance and more features, also more of user friendly than this Phone.

This phone has connectivity issue, download speed reduces in this phone drastically. My wife has M40,switched my vodafone sim between M30s and M40 and found huge difference in download speed.
Body has cracking sound if you hold you phone from side, reported by many . Check you tube reviews.  I am using samsung various phones from last 10 years, this phone is not upto samsung build and connectivity mark.
Battery is good. But not fully satisfied with this samsung.

One of the most advanced phones in the offerings,  I got jabardast deals on Amazon by SBI card, Amazon payback offer and Exchange offer. Phone is amazing as its tripple 48 MP camera is super duper quality. Gaming is efficiently operated and easy to use. 6000 MA Battery is Subhanallah in this price which is a marathoner if compared. 6GB RAM is addictive. Selfies are also like DSLR quality. ROM is awesome 128 GB. I selected it over iPhone 7. I'm just lovin it.

This is a very good product from samsung.
I am USING this phone from 15 days. Battery life is amazing. In normal uses it can be used till 2 days. as per medium use it will be last upto 1.5 days. About performance samsung new one Ui is very much optimized and smooth.Screen is super amoled so video watching experience is very good.Sound quality is good with external earphone it supports Dolby atmos sound which gives a very good sound and music experience.Fingerprint ridder is not very much fast but speed is ok.About camera quality it gives decent photos in natural light.in partial light it is ok.super slow motion video limit is 6 sec only.wide angle photos is very good but resolution is not that much.portrait mode is ok.Forgaming it is very good with 6GB variant.You can play pubg with Hdr mode. You can play pubg 7 hours  with the battery full 100%.In cons only one cons is there polycarbonate body but that is ok with this price range.

Samsung M30s 6GB 128GB is an amazing phone. Face recognition is very fast and so is the fingerprint scanner. It takes splitsecond to open phone. I use phone for all purposes one may think of and I see zero lag in all operations.

I was looking for similar phones in this pricing for couple of years. I have compared with almost all phones and found M30s is the best at this pricing. I believe in value purchasing and M30s fits exactly.  Medium segment phone with very good features and build quality. Touch is awesome; feel so smooth. Battery life coming for 2 days of continuous use. I only feel its little more weight compared to my previous phone, may be due to 6k mah battery.

Fingerprint reader Is very fast and accurate. Never fumbled till now. So the face recognition, Awesome.

No need to say about camera quality as it's the best in class with 48MP with 8 and 5MP for depth. Selfie camera is with 16MP takes clean photos. Works best even in low lighting conditions.

I strongly recommend Samsung M30s to everyone looking for medium segment phone.

This feedback is being typed on M30s at it's the best thing to do on smooth screen. I love it!

Really a great product, amazing performance as of now. Camera performance is really incredible. Sound quality is also great, Fingerprint detection appears to be little slow, however it may be due to partial coverage of sensor by fingerprint. Battery supports for long time, I tested it twice and it supported for around 36 hours with single charging. Must buy product with this price range. Best compared to other in this range.

Overall rating 4.5

I got this mobile in 11500 (10% sbi card discount + 1100 in Amazon cash back)

Rating after 3 days intensive use...

Camera is 4.2 with some amazing feature. But there is still some improvement need as nowadays our expectation never end :)....

Display... you will fall in love with display. It is very soft to eyes and colors are very natural. However there is option to for vivid display which give you more bright display. However I prefer more to natural color.

Battery life. Despite of  A very huge usage as this is new phone all day I used mobile. Still 2 days usage backup easily get.

Look ..looks are casual...

Phone has been bought for mom's school.
Delivery was super speedy and fantastic!
From what I hear, the battery back up is really really good and the phone looks very premium!
They tell me that Super amoled display is vibrant and much better than the previous Xiaomi phone they were using.
48MP camera mode is not default, it is 12MP. One has to switch to 48MP through settings. Once that is done, you can take life size shots with excellent details.
Multi-tasking is great on the phone without any lags or hanging.
Overall great phone, affordable price, good offer from Amazon, trusted brand.
Simply love Samsung products!

This mobile outfit is not properly fixed if I hold the mobile there is a crack sound is coming and the main problem is switch on and off button is not that much popped out from the mobile it is fixed with the panel itself but volume button looks fine...so thought to replace this product service engineer came and he taking pictures of the mobile I don't know why he taking pictures my issue will not resolve if they take pictures because there is no damage that we can see I told if we holding the mobile crack sound coming below to the switch on and off button which makes me uncomfortable to use this mobile thinking of that my mobile will get damage....

Everything has great in this phone touch sensitivity, Super amoled screen, build quality, sensors, easy to handle, one of the best UI (One UI) excluding battery backup. Everyone telling about its battery life but the product which I received has worst quality of battery inside phone.
When I watched reviews on YouTube every popular YouTuber told that it has a great battery backup and many things. When I used it for two days I'm very disappointed with this phone's battery backup my only purpose to purchase this phone because of its Monster size battery backup.
It loosed my confidence about Samsung because first time I purchased any Samsung product and it ruins my dreams in just two days.
My humble request to seller please replace this faulty product as soon as possible because I purchased this phone by requesting my father that this phone has a huge Monster size battery and now if my father know that battery backup was not as good as mentioned  online and on YouTube channels, they will never trust on me in future and if I lost his trust then I'm unable to take any decision independently.
Worst battery.......!

Prior to M30s, I was a Google pixel user, this phone offers same experience with peace of mind from battery perspective. Samsung one UI is ergonomically better from single hand usage perspective. Others must follow the lead in this aspect.

Camera is sub-par compared to pixel, but I won't complain much since the battery of this phone compensates for anything else that may be missing.

Camera works. It is alright.

I am not a mobile gaming user. For regular usage, no complaint from performance perspective. Haven't experienced any heating issues so far.

It's a well built phone. Good screen.

I am very happy with this purchase. It's a value for money phone.

Samsung you are winning hearts.

PS: ads on lock screen are annoying. Tried to find a way to remove them, but unsuccessful so far.

Pros :
*Excellent display
*Good battery life (Thanks to 6000mAh + sAMOLED effect)
*Back camera output is decent at outdoor(daylight) - but softening is more.
*Videwine L1 supported
*One UI is excellent(2nd best android skin-1st is obviously Oxygen)
*RAM management is good(mine is 6GB
 variant)
*Perfect for non-hardcore gamers

Cons :
*Worst built quality (Better use a qood quality back case)
*No Gorilla glass 5 (I think even Gorilla glass 3 is also not present) - Better use a good quality tempered glass,since AMOLED screens are more fragile than IPS LCD panels.
*Only 15W fast charging supported (nowadays most phones supports 18W charging) -So it takes about 2h 40mins to charge from 0 to 100 % .
*Night photography is pathetic even in 'Night mode'
*No G-cam full support(limited) - due to Exynos .
*Front cam is not good(more softened photos) and pathetic at night.

Didn't expected 48mp camera acts like this. Very worst pics outcome. No detailing when we zoom the pics.

Screen unlock with sensor is opening when others trird to open the lock.

Screen unlocks even we close the eyes.

All music applications are pausing after sometime of playing music.

No back cover too provided with which quick scratches are guaranteed.

Extremely dissatisfied and all reviews shown hype regarding camera. Hope something fishy.

The display is awesome. The front camers misses out on flash but the in display screen flash does a good job. Wide angle is superb. The triple cam  is good too its 48 megapixel which is a huge leap for the midrange phone from the 13 or 16 MP cams moreover assisted by AI (for best shots). The professional settings would have scored more points if they were available. Only if there could be optical zoom there would have been no turning back 💯 but its way too much to ask at this price.

The only setback would be the back where it looses to itz competitors in finish &amp; texture where redmi7s or realme xt has a far premium feel. M30s feels like it has plastic back a bettr design was the least we coild ask.

Battery life is as good as a powerbank but doesn't weigh as a powerbank. Dual sim 4g support with dedicated memory card. I'm using a 128gb addon memory in addition to in built 128gb i.e the phone is running smooth with 256gb aided by 6gb RaM. Heating issues are nil during  moderate use but the fast charging heats it a little 🤏 but may be because of the back cover. No earphone is provided 👎

Galaxy store is a big irritation as it forces to install unnecessary apps.  Samsung should refrain from promoting apps let that be at owner's discretion.
Finger print is positioned well but it's outdated as inscreen finger print detection is  trending.

Things i like about product-
The overall build quality, the display, the battery. The value for money( I bought 6/128 opal balck for ₹14500(including cashback1500+1000))
What I don't like-
I expected a better camera(because it's samsung) but camera quality is average. Video stabilization is worst.
In daylight you get good photos but they doesn't look as good as other 48MP cameras.
Hope a software update may change things.

Without doubt M30s has the best display which is smooth to handle and fills your heart with joy. The 91% screen ratio is adorable. The 6000 mAh battery is the best thing that can happen to a phone and I can work 2 full days with my phone before I recharge. For a 6000 mAh battery, the phone is surely light weight. Although Samsung claims fast charging, it's still a little slow! 6000 mAh is big and this could be the reason. Although charging speed is not so great, it's adequate I would say. Another best part about the phone is that there is no crazy heating issues. Prolonged usage or charging does not make M30s a hot tava. Performance has been great, no hang ups or glitches. Looks like Samsung's Exynos 9611 is packed with some great stuff.
A 48M pixel camera with depth and wide angle supporting cameras is an attractive combination. Although not the best camera, it's still great.

All these at a price of Rs. 16,999/- is just incredible.

Well...A BRUTAL AND HONEST REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS OF MODERATE USAGE.

I gifted my dad this phone , who previously owned ONE PLUS 3 , I was little skeptical before to gift this device , but my dad needed a good battery life and a cheaper device so that he won't bother it changing it after 1/1.5 years , when 5G will be available across all devices.
So , after reading spects and comparing it with other players in market who offered more features I still sticked to SAMSUNG BRAND IMAGE.
BUT THE PHONE DISAPPOINTED MY FATHER FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY.

1) DESPITE IF HAVING 6 GIGS OF RAM UNDERNEATH , PHONE IS REALLY SLOW , IT LAGS LIKE IT HAS ONLY 2 GIGS OF RAM.

2) CAMERA FEELS SO CHEAP &amp; POOR , TRUST ME , ONE PLUS 3 HAS FAR BETTER SINGLE CAMERA , THAN THOSE 3 CAMERAS .

3) BATTERY , REALLY 6000MAH SAMSUNG GUYS ?? IT ONLY LASTS FOR 24 HOURS , WITH JUST MODERATE USAGE OF CALLS AND SOCIAL NETWORKING. MY DAD DOESN'T PLAY ANY GAMES OR LISTENS TO ANY MUSIC OR STUFF LIKE THAT , STILL ONLY LASTS 1 DAY ONLY . I REALLY EXPECTED TO LAST ATLEAST 35-40 HOURS , WHICH IT DOESN'T !

4) FOOLED FOR FAST CHARGING , IT JUST HAS 15W CHARGER , WHICH IS REALLY SLOW, AGAIN I HAVE TO COMPARE IT WITH MY PREVIOUS OP3 , AS IT HAS DASH CHARGE , WHICH IS REAL -REAL FAST THAN ANYTHING.

5) LAST THING , THE PHONE IS DEAD NOW , YES IT IS DEAD NOW , YOU HAVE TO BELEIVE IT GUYS , SAMSUNG SHOWED AN UPDATE OF APRROX 1500 MB , FOR UPADATION FROM ANDROID 9 TO ANDROID 10 . I WAS EXCITED TO UPDATE HOPING FOR SOME OVERALL IMPROVEMENT ON BATTERY AND PERFORMANCE , BUT AFTER SUCCESSFUL DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION , IT GOT HANGED ON RESTART AND ONLY THING I CAN SEE ON SCREEN IS " SAMSUNG" LOGO .
WHOLE NIGHT IT WAS LIKE THAT HOPING IT TO GET RESTARTED , BUT AFTER BATTERY DRAIN IT SWITCHED OFF , AFTER CHARGE I TRIED TO TURN IT ON , BUT AGAIN SAME THING SHOWED UP.
I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET IT ON , BUT IT GOT DEAD NOW.

MY DAD IS YELLING ON ME LIKE ANYTHING , LIKE I HAD DONE ANY CRIME TO BUY THAT PHONE . HE HAS LOST ALL HIS VALUABLE DATA OF PICTURES AND MESSAGES. NOW BECAUSE OF GLOBAL LOCKDOWN IN COUNTRY I AM UNABLE IT GO ANYWHERE AND GET IT FIXED.

BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS I AM REALLY NOT IMPRESSED BY THIS DEVICE BY SAMSUNG.

IF I COULD HAVE THE OPTION TO RETURN THIS AND REPLACE WITH S20 ULTRA SERIES , I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT IMMEDIATELY , BECAUSE " S" SERIES BY SAMSUNG IS MASTERCLASS

I HOPE THIS REVIEW WILL HELP TO ALL THE FUTURE BUYERS.
PLEASE RATE IT HELPFUL.
THANKS

It's a phone which does not meet the expectations, not value for money , Amazon or Samsung saying falls information on galaxy m30s,
- RAM- company saying 6 GB + 128 - not performing like 6GB RAM its hanging always ,RAM performance is like less than 4GB,
- By looking the phone is very good colour, design but plastic body
- Camera is good ,
- Company saying fast charging but it's taking more than 4 hour to full charge
- Not a gorilla glass on the screen ,company saying its scratch proof ,but it's already scratches on the glass ,
- Note 8 pro or Any Honor phone is better than this at the prize range
- Finger print reader is just ok only not that much good
- Battery life is just fine 6000 mah but getting 4000 mah

Very bad purchase

What I Like in m30s :
1.Very beautiful phone
2.very good battery
3.Light weight with such a huge battery
4.Very attractive price in this segment
Fast charging
5.Super amoled display is wonderful and beat any other display even in sunlight use
6. samsung one UI which puts this phone above redmi and realme's similar range
7. Loudspeaker is good and loud .

What I Dislike in m30s :
1. Dolby digital sound is more on bass( not crystal clear or original music).
2. Back side should have glass material .
3. No gorilla glass protection .

All in all , this phone is a beauty and masterpiece in this range of under 20k for 6 GB+128gb and under 15 k for 4 GB+64gb devices.

Folks ..!! Let me warn you of Samsung,s new strategy to earn money ...after sales .  After using this phone for 2 months ..one day i kept the phone on charging only to get a dead phone in the morning.. when took to service center .. was told its water damage hence warranty void. When wrote to service head , I was told they woukd give 25% discount to repair the phone at 11k...so i am supposed to pay 8k to repair a phone under warranty.. the phone never went under water .. no other damage .
Clearly Samsung has become a currupted company to save its profit ...stay away from samsung

Bought this phone 2 weeks back. Actually I read lot of negative reviews about the camera but to be Frank I have found it pretty decent. Might be samsung have worked on it. Wide angle camera is the highlight.
Till now running smooth and with the monster battery u get around 2 days screen time.
Watched few movies on phone. The display quality is one of the best though sound quality is not at Par.
No headphones with this phone.
Like iPhone or one plus charger has different slot. So you have to have samsung charger and can't use any other android phone charger.
No Hanging issue till now.
Connects well with smart view service with my Samsung Smart TV.
Overall a Nice Poduct and giving 4 stars.

A wonderful phone from Samsung with 100% positives only.  I bought this phone before my family vacation and clicked more than 2000+ images in various places.

The camera is extra-ordinary. The photo clarity is amazing. Landscape views are perfect to cover the entire range. No need to carry any camera if you have Samsung M30s.

Battery power is massive. Forget charging for 2 days. If you have less number of apps then the battery will even go for 3 to 5 days.

The AMOLED display is so crisp and perfect. The phone total performance is also good and responsive.

Was lucky to choose Samsung M30s (instead of Redmi Note 8). It was a great decision I need not have to regret!  The best budget phone to go below Rs 15000.

Loved it in total. 5 Stars Team Samsung!!

I myself am not a fan of camera. I really don't understand why people run behind the camera features of a phome. Yes its true that the phones have replaced the digital cameras but still i prefer those while many of my fruends are crazy about clicking the pictures on their phones and doing all kinds of effects for posting on insta and facebook. I myeself has owned coolpad note 3, mia1 and mia2. All of which were launched with camera as one of their biggest highlights but i was surprised coz the number of photoes i clicked on them were very rare and even when i had taken on each of them they were good like mia1 introduced the bokeh effect and that was awesome. Mi a2 also had sported the greater spec camera but i have taken lesser photoes on it. Basically i unlike many am not a fan of camera and also beleives that a phone buyer should rather than looking into camera specs looks at three major things and those are:
1.The display,
2.The processor and ram management for multitasking and lastly, 3.The battery
and taking those into consideration is why i had bought all these ones and i didn't regret even once except that apart from these three i also love listening to songs and am in love with the 3.5mm headfone jack,so was a but disappointed about mia2 coz they ditched those.But mia2 was stock android and was one pf my favourites and one other lack was the battery which i had to charge more often but it has a support for qualcomm quickcharge 4+ and hence a fast charging charger like one of xiaomis own or the one i had bought like baseus from the chinese websites will really help u a lot. Yes i know i have been beating around bushes for a long now so coming to the point tbe m30s it has been pnly 3days since i have recieved the phone. And i am totally in love with it, the widevine l1 technology lets you watch all streaming apps on hd clarity which was not mentioned here. The display hands off... Its the best i have used.. Samsung and their display are still unmatched. Then the second one the processor was able to keep almost as mych as eight apps in mememory without actually killing them. 3.its mammoth i don't actually mind taking mpre time to charge a phone but i want a battery that stays long enpugh fir all my ativities and this is one such phone.Streaming a movie on netflix at hd just took out 4 percent. U cud imagine its powere in that way and there are many reviews on tje battery everywhere and i am not gonna elaborate on that but what i thought was missing from many of the reviews is the info on one ui. The one ui... Actually i was skeptical about it befofe getting the fone and had been thinking of putting nova launcher for the stock android experience (which is the best launcher still along with cml launcher) with my prefernece of icon packs but when i got the phone one ui... I fell in love with it. As said the bloatwares many of them can be unintalled and the others can be disabled. Samsung has lots of their apps pn the phone among which are galaxy apps, nptes, game launcher, gallery, internet and all of which i lkke some and other i don't and hence disabled first itself then i noticed new app called samsung max and thats an awesome one which lets u run webapps like facebook smoothly without creating a different icon for them with chrome and antitracking using an inbuilt vpn and protection with privacy from hackers. Also the samsungs own memory bosst app ks one of the bwst i have seen. I haven't really put the camera into use but the phone is awesome and i now have started believing in the samsungs nidrange budget phones as customer friendly. I wud definitely suggest the phone to everyone. The comparison of the phone is with realme xt it also supports all th efeatures with dual glass more aesthetic finish better camera and all but the interface and battery i am not a fan off although it has the vooc charger within the box which i a plus point. I am currently giving realme time for making stabilized version of the interface with better battery capacuty and if you checj at the critical reviews on flipkart u may find that it struggles on the battery life and camera is not as good as on papers and color os is just not polished enough. Oh i almost forgot the all night mode on one ui is just is awesome. On an amoled it helps you save a lot of battery too. Overall its a great phone and doesn't weigh more even though it has a bttery to make it bigger and never heats up
Anyways guys ill keep you updated after a month of usage

writing it after 10 days of usage.
Worst part is that i was busy to send the mobile back or i would just throw away to Samsung for sure.
Pros:
 good looking appearance
 better battery life but doesn't meet my expectation for 6000 mah
 better processing

Cons:
 Worst Camera Ever faced.
 Worst fast charging ever faced. It takes 4 hrs fast charging from 20% to 100%.
 Phone gets heat after playing a low graphic game for 15 mins.
 phone gets rebooted on its own.
 last but not least the basic feature of the phone is calling and the mic quality is very bad.

Didn't expect this from Samsung. Will give - 5 rating if possible.

This is my first samsung device and am loving it♡

Got the device prettty much on time at 7.45 am in morning amazing delivery !!!
well now about the device i'd give pretty much 4.5 all round rating .
 Good camera , amazing battery .
PROS.
1. Chip inside is 9611 and it is blazingly fast no doubts about it idk why everyone was saying it is bad and blah blab blah . This is amazing phone guys its fastt its fluid super smooth!!!
2. For gaming - this phone is better then redmi phones . I have used redmi phones well since starting this beats them ! Honestly .
 I played pubg on balanced and ultra fps and it whats freakingly smooth!! Guyzz no lag whatsoever ya fps will fluctuate but no that much it 9 out of 10 times the gameplay will be smooth!!! Loveing it.
3. Sound  &amp;  display quality is realllly great!! THIS IS SAMOLED PANEL IS AWSOME . BELIEVE ME . IN LOVE WITH THE DISPLAY .PS: THIS WAS ALSO A RSN WHY I BOUGHT THE DEVICE :P. SOUND QUALITY IS AWSOME YOU GET DOLBY ATMOS MOW WHAT MORE you WANT :P
4.software. !
 This gets one ui and pie and mind you this is the best software. Ui experience is amazing its sso smoothh! You will love it . Some bloatware but u can uninstall it but software you will fall in love with it.
5. Camera quality is good . I would say indoor pics  are okayish outdoor are also good . Well for a 14k phone (excluding disc and ol) it performs reallly well .
Cons

1. Not much i have found any con this is 2nd day of using it.
 Well just that the while gaming it will go to 37 -39*c thats it.
2. Some software optimization needs to be done via software which samsung will surely provide i believe in them. They really provide regular updates thats just . It.
3. SOME SOFTWARE OPTIMIZATION NEEDED BUT THATS JUST IT.
 NOTHING FOR CONS AS AM REALLY LOVING THE DEVICE AND THERES NOTHING BAD ABOUT IT.
Am providing not much cam shots but 1pic was clicked while the lights were off and using night mode . And i guess for a 14k phn excluding the discounts its a very good allround phone.
Ps- this is my first review am writing sorry in advance if i wasnt so good at it 😅 so thanks guyzz!!♡♡.

Average product, advertise gimmick, camera not upto mark my old mobile with 13 Mp camera click better images then this
Heating issue for normal usage
Battery drains - at 10:30 am today I charged with full now at 12:00 PM its 64% with minimal usage of internet and calling no idea where is monster, my 3 years old mobile gives same capacity
Out of 4 GB ram 2.6 already utilized you are getting only aprox 900 mb free space
Touch response not so quick
No touch vibration
Processor looks quite average compared with vivo snapdragon takes little time

Only plus point I feel here is display quality rest don't expect it from Samsung
Still cannot compete other Chinese brand to give you better option

So don't be hurry in buying wait and compare and buy with actual users experience not as per YouTube tech videos

Very satisfied with purchase . Camera clarity is good and battery backup too. Functions and apps are working  smoothly. If you play High graphics game for long time phone might get hot not very much but slightly above normal. Under normal conditions there is no heating  issue. The in build game launcher provision is very good. The phone is also very flexible and can be personalized easily. In build night mode and blue light filter iis pretty usefull especially if you spend a lot time in your mobile during the nights. Overall a very good mobile for 17k by Samsung.

The device looks and feels amazing. It definitely adds to your style and turns heads when you use the device.
Product delivery was on time.
Packing and boxing was at par.

Pros:
The phone is awesome in terms of looks.
Great battery life.
Good charge time with the fast charger.
Large screen + Decently bright
Comes with dark/ night mode
Good day lights photos
Firm, strong and averagely heavy device
Pubg is smoother
Dual LTE/ 4G

Cons:
Low light photos are grainy
Selfies in artificial (not sunlight) light is grainy (natural, no correction or tweaking)
Phone lags a bit
Initially the camera also lags while clicking and saving the image.
48 mpxls photos are nice but there is a lag or processing time required to save these photos.

Conclusion:
All in all, it is a decent device.
Okay for normal users and users with lots of patience.
External features are awesome.  Internals are great too. But the problem of lagging and freezing persists.  Reminds me of mega series Samsung phones (2013-2014)

First I would like to thank Samsung for this phone. My first smart phone was from Samsung, in a way Samsung  introduced  me to the android  world. I used almost all brands of smartphones but cant match the quality Samsung  gives. Comming to this MONSTER
I was looking  for a best branded phone in my budget fro the last 6 months nothing was upto my requirements. Even before buying M30s i was in a doubt like  whether it will live upto the expectations or not. I just wanted to give a try.
Belive me Samsung is back with a bang in the budget range phones segment.
I ordered phone on the release date got delivered  on the same day thanks Amazon  for there amazing fast delivery.
Comming to the phone performance its quite good its to use and no hang till now.
Samsung is branding this M30s as MONSTER! yes it is Having a MONSTER battery, god its been 5 days i have charged this phone for just 2 times belive this the best thing which i loving more its not exaggeration u can feel this when u use this MONSTER.  Camera quality  is amazing  for the price we are paying people  are concerned  about the aperture right generally people think with 1.9 aperture get good pics but use this MONSTER  48 MP camera and wide angle camera u will be amazed with the quality  of pics.
Finally the SAMOLED Display cant tell u the quality of view i have, u jave just experience  the difference.
Great job by Samsung Team.
Best Branded Phone to buy in the Budget  segment.

My previous phone was oneplus3. Sharing my reviews comparing with oneplus3 (Purchased in 2016 oct and still working).

Camera :- Quality o fthe pics will dissapoint you if you compare with oneplus cameda 32 mp.

Fingerprint:- it takes more time to unlock than oneplus.

Battary:- The only advantage is 6000mha battry..happy with battry life.after 2 months use.

Notification Led:-  Lack with any led notification.

Dual LTE :-Advantage to use samsung here .

Additional memory slot- advantage for samsung.

Overall happy with the product as per cost. So i you are not concerend about cost look for a better product like s9 or s10 .

Completely fake publicity, Camera 48mp, another joke ,after using you will realise it is not even 12mp, my old moto e4 having camera 8mp is similar to its 48mp
Don't buy this phone, inested of this go for m30 or m20 if you have battery affinity. Because apart from battery,there is nothing extra in this phone.

This phone has some serious issue with regard to d mobile network reception. Hardly 2 bars of network available n connectivity is poor. Complained to Samsung customer care n they informed that this issue is faced by many customers n they will flag it. As per them, network issue may be resolved with the next software update. Keeping my fingers crossed!
Camera is not great as claimed. Body is plastic..my phone got dented with a little fall. Will use it for a couple of months n exchange with a better option.
Amazon needs to see that as promised here, they are not providing 15 watt charger. It's a 9 watt charger only.

After 3months of usage, I should say I am now eligible to right a practical and honest review.

Well, I bought this for my father who works manager projects(Civil engineer) at a renowned private company. So he has to take several pictures of sites, how construction is going on and stuff to report to higher authorities everyday. This does the job just for that. It clicks really good shots which are detailed even when fully zoomed in. It works stunning in daylight, never tested in low light tho.

The battery! The only thing I wanted for my father which made me buy this over redmi note 8, is the battery. Yes, this lasts all day and in the night, when his duty ends, I mostly see more than 40% charge. Which is just what I wanted my father to have. Gets from 0-100% in around 2.5 hours

Never tested games. And I am pretty sure note 8 will outperform this one in gaming. And gaming is the only thing my papa hates the most.

Display. In those sunny days on the construction sites, the Super Amoled display does the best job possible. I use a phone which has a IPS Panel and I know the difficulties of seeing screen under the Sun. Its very crisp, the display in this device. And big as well.

Ram Rom is not an issue at all. A middle aged man has nothing that requires more than 64gb I guess. And I already said this, he hates games and 4gb ram or 3gb, its fine untill he can call people and send messages in WhatsApp.

Got like more than 3 updates since bought and the UI is flawless ( definitely better than those Chinese miui rom which I myself use, poco rom, vivo rom etc etc you know the deal).

Final Verdict-If you want to use this phone as a PHONE, then this is definitely for you. Its the beast budget phone which as much I can predict, wont have a competition for next 10years (6000mAh was also there in 2012 but it was then a big deal to have in phones, its also in 2019 a big deal as well). Just remember, don't try to think that you will turn this into a full fledged PC and play GTA 5 or something in it. As I said, use it as a phone and expect it to do phony things. You wont be disappointed.

Looks-6/10
Battery-12/10
Ram Rom Processor Gpu-7.5/10 (compared to other budget phones)
Display-9/10(I expect more brighter screen)
Camera-9/10(needs improvement on wideangle shots, selfie shots and bokeh shots(tho i hate the whole concept of mimicking DSLR bokeh effects on cell phones)
UI-10/10
VFM-10/10

Comments no. 1. Camera picture quality is very very BAD , it is not 48 mp ( totally FUN) , always white shadow arises on photo . 2. Finger print sensor does not work for screen light off, only work for on. So always need to use off -on switch .3 . Data off- on point position  staying in the middle portion of the screen so it not easy to use . In accordance its total behaviour this SET is not GOOD. You can buy another  in this price. Thanks

It's a cool product. It has a gorgeous display. Let me get the cons out of the way first. I have been a Motorola user and never liked softened photos on other phones. This M30s is notorious for softening out the details when using the front cam. I didn't find any option to remove this and stuff. So I would be waiting for a gcam mod to arrive.
Apart from the camera the phone feels nice in hand. Somehow it's camera adjusts every time I close it giving off a sound somewhat similar to the s10. I have to get it checked once, Whether the sound is expected or not. The phone does feel good in hand apart from a slight creak that I hear because of some plastics not getting together properly.

Charging speed is not so great but it will suffice as it does have a good battery. Games are good. And I had to replace the stock launcher coz I wanted to customize and samsung store was expecting me to pay money for icon packs and themes. Not cool samsung. Dark theme is good. There is a screen recording feature but that just works for games. That's bad. I installed nova launcher and used the lines free icon pack and it's been simply awesome. Waiting for a case as the back can get easily scratched up. Please use a Matt finish while making polycarbonate backs.please samsung. Also all other mobile companies. I would like to feel confident while carrying it without worrying of scratches. Bluetooth range is good. Mobile data reception is good. The display panel makes you feel that your phone is no less than a premium phone while using.

In amazon prime I always had the issue of the video not going till the edges(Notch part). Samsung got a nice fix for it. In the settings you can actually force an app to use the screen till the edges. That's a nice tweak. I wish samsung offered free customization options in their store or at least allow downloaded fonts to be used. That would let so many users not download third party launchers just like myself.

It doesn't feel heavy in hand. Though touted 6000 mah it does ensure a minimum of 5860 mah. It has the device optimizer and some stuff inbuilt. A very good thing is that you can actually uninstall most of the preloaded apps except a couple of apps including Netflix and Galaxy store.

Please change the camera algorithm samsung. It feels so touched up. And that's all folks. I believe it's worth it.

I found fps drop and lag while playing mobile legends in the lowest resolution . Worst performance. Dont know if only my product has this defect or all the devices. I asked for a replacement the amazon service told no replacements in terms of performance  lag .
#even my moms asus zenfone max m1 worth 6k runs the game  without lag and fps drop. Think before you buy it .
Other than that over all user interface  was impresssive.
And battery performance is good . And the dispaly is the key feature

Like: Mobile has good screen size and good display quality.Look wise phone is very good.
Fast charging as it's type C charger.

Dislike:
No headphone provided which is now in all phones
It has triple rear camera but it takes time to capture snap.
This phone has 6 GB RAM but perfomance  wise not much difference  with 4GB RAM other mobiles
One major problem I see is mobile network signal strength is also weak it takes time when I call someone then after 30 second some dialer tone will come.
Not sure this is because of Idea network issue in pune or because of mobile.

Display is good, that's all, very weak camera, low signal, and wifi won't connect if you are far by 5feet way from the  Router. And when on 4g Voice calls, so much of heat around the ear piece, and if you download something say more than 100MB, That's all, the area around the front camera is boiling like anything, and the Custoner tech guy, installs, some diagnostics app, and says battery temp is 34C, and it is below 48C, and it is not replaceable.  Samsung in order to compete with chineese makers, started using the exchanged phone hardware for new phones and selling at low price to capture the Indian market.we all Indian s are becoming fools by seeing the Camers specs, instead of the real purpose of phone. I WILL NEVER BUY ANY SAMSUNG PHONE AGAIN.

The worst battery ever, I've come across with a Samsung smart phone. A very very substandard mobile phone. GO MONSTER the tagline is really ridiculous and misleading. I got my set hardly 5 days ago. The battery hardly last for 5 hours, even in IDLE condition. I exchanged my J7 MAX, a very good mobile. In lieu I got something so so bad. Even a Chinese mobile would have been far better than this awesomely worst mobile. Surely will think thousand times before finalizing any Samsung smart phone in future. A complete waste of money and time. The worst experience with my favourite brand Samsung. Hopefully the concerns will be considered with importance.

DONT'T BUY THIS PHONE. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST USELESS DEVICES IN TERMS OF BATTERY BACKUP. DOESNT EVEN LAST 1 DAY.

Update after 15 days. So Amazon sent a technician who played youtube videos for 5-10 mins and deduced that the product battery is perfect. Some major lying and misleading advestisements on the part of Samsung and Amazon.

Am taking Amazon and Samsung to consumer court.

Very poor battery. Doesn't even last 24 hrs. Phones with 4000 ma batteries last for 48 hrs. Had stopped using Samsung long time back but was attracted by battery size. Extremely Disappointed.

Camera quality is poor. Moto one action 's 24mp camera is far better than M30s 48MP.
Build quality is poor didn't expected this from Samsung.
Disappointed with this product. Not worth of money.

The phone is overall good, and the price that I paid is really good as I got 2300 discount plus 1000 Rs cashback in Amazon Pay.
As par as quality of the camera is concerned initially I was very upset as the camera doesn't give you 48 MP quality but afterwards I realised that it can give 48 MP with certain T&amp;C. But the different modes in the camera is good if u can learn them faster it is better. Video quality ok. So maybe I would give 3.5 to the entire camera.

But real plus for this phone is the battery backup which is awesome and after an entire days of work with this phone which includes extensive internet browsing, calling, camera everything the battery still remains at around 40%. Though I have not used in gaming so cannot say how that feedback will be.
Fingerprint sensor is decently good but may not be the best. Face id is good so far.

Received M30s on 29th itself being a prime member. Enlisting pros and cons both after four days of use....

Pros...
Superb battery with fast charge. Took just 2.5 hrs to charge from 0% to 100% for 6000MAH bat. Rear camera is awesome with advanced camera options. Net speed is express and does multitasking effortlessly. Super Amoled deep curved screen looks uber cool. Saphire Blue colour looks mindblowing!!

Cons....
Front camera has no flash light. No corning gorilla glass protection. No led light indicators.

Overall at this price point its a monster from Samsung and a sure shot winner.

Bought it as a prime member on the day it was launched and it after almost a month of usage, I reckon it was a brilliant decision.

Unbelievable battery easily lasting for a day and half on moderate usage, continuously connected to WiFi.
Camera take stellar quality pictures and the ULTRA WIDE lens is just the thing I wanted and at this price! That was my primary reason to go for this handset.
Screen resolution is decent at this price range.
Overall touch and feel of the phone makes it premium quality.

I started using the mobile from 30 Sep 2019 the day i received it.

Liked :
1. Battery Life is Good (6000 mah)
2. Sensitivity is Good - they have added a special feature to increase response if you are using a screen guard.
3. Look &amp; Colour is really awesome.
4.  Samsung has its own Galaxy Store for Apps and also if having features of Google Play &amp; Microsoft Apps
5. Its A Dual LTE mobile phone so both sims remain active for the call.
6. It as a support for Dual Messenger App (Whatsapp, Snapchat, Facebook, Telegram, FB Messenger) So now you can have 2 whatsapp account on the same mobile.
7. Option to use separate contact lists for different WhatsApp and for other apps.
8. It has a Device Care feature to support Batter Charging, free Storage from unnecessary junk files, Free Memory by stopping background app, Security feature using McAfee, Ultra Data Saving.
9. Dolby Atmos feature for enhancing handsfree music listening experience.

Disliked
1. Should have provided with a handsfree.
2. A screen guard would have been an added benefit

As of now, I can use the phone very comfortably. Will be updating any additional features and drawback if any in coming time.

After 30 days of my use i am writing this:
Pros:
Super amoled display
Super quality 48mp cam(you need to set for that)
Super speed in this price segment
Cons
Laggy one ui
I don't play any games so I don't have idea about it's graphics
Battery backup should be improved not as for 6000mah.
Front cam is not upto mark
Software features like samsung Knox,private folder,app lock in built ,s bike,samsung pay,music are missing.
Somewhat heavy.
Worst night mode
Worst GPS system ever seen
Network reception is too worst
Processor seems to be very hungry high battery consumption
My suggestion is to go for realme Xt or realme 3pro,Redmi note 8pro

Likes:
1. awesome screen, no other device in this bracket gives a full hd super amoled display
2. processor if good, definity better than 665 and way better than 660
3. Superb battery life, 6000mah is insane
4. light weight
5. i own a samsung tab a 10.1 and since then i have loved the one ui.

Dislikes:
1. flex below power button
2. camera is average compared to other phones though not much of an issue for me.
3. charging is a bit slow, 15w charger seems lacking. may be 18w charger will work better
4. weird occasional lags.

Product is good. Weight is also normal for a 6000 mAH battery. Camera quality is not as expected. Processor could be a bit improved. Ram management is absolutely fine. When it comes to battery life for heavy user it comes for 1 day and moderate user it comes around day and a half when data is completely on. I didn't observe any much difference with the Dolby Atmos option provided when headset or earphones plugged in. Worth buying the product at this price range from samsung.

Hello, I am here to review Samsung Galaxy m30s smartphones. I am using this phone last 2 months and trust me this smartphone is very good in performance in comparison to other smartphone.
It's battery is very very good. I tested it's battery backup i must say it giving 1.5 day backup after so so much uses like i play games alot, movies, online streamings and etc.. after that when i putting into charging i have remaining 30% battery more. So if you are using your phone so much like me then buy this phone.

I don't need say about screen because it's Samsung super amoled display you know what experience about amoled your gaming graphics &amp; movies experience goes up.

Now talk about camera M30S camera is good with 3 lances with all functionality like slow motion, super slow motion, depth camera, live focus and all. Their are selfy camera 16 mega px which is also good.

We got exynos 9611 Processor and octa_core cpu which supports your gaming graphics in high hd and not so much heating problem it depends on your gaming graphics and time.

All over i say this Samsung m30s smartphone is fully functional and loaded with all over specifications like fingerprint sensor and other in your budget.

So if you want performance take samsung m30s smartphone.

Loving my new phone. Great camera quality. Slow motion and super slow motion videos are stunning. Phone is very fast (6gb ram 128gb storage). Supports fast charging. Android pie.

Samsung has priced this phone very aggressively. I got it for rs15300 with additional rs1000 amazon casback for using sbi card. Value for money. Effective price rs14300 for 6gb 128gb.

Amazon delivery was very fast. The sale opened on sept 28 at 12 noon for prime members. I ordered at 12:05. The phone arrived the next day morning at 11:30am.

Here is a pro tip:
To do fast charging on your car, you need to purchase the following.
1) fast charger for car
2) fast charging type C cable (if you happen to have a fast charging micro usb cable, then just buy a micro usb to type C adapter on amazon).

Received the mobile this afternoon and I must say, Samsung has nailed it this time. Redmi, Realme etc r gonna have a tough time competing with this one.

Coming to features:

1. Build - Build is decent. Neither very premium nor cheap. But the opal black color is royal I must say. Very classy. Weight distribution is excellent. Doesn't feel like a 6000 Mah battery.

2. Display - Need i say anything about a Samsung Super Amoled display. Awesome awesome awesome. Bright colors, deep blacks. Too good &amp; too rich. I personally love the Always On Display.

3. Camera - Yet to test the camera fully but initial impressions. The main sensor is awesome. 48mp cam. Uses the pixel binning technology to click 12mp pics which r beautiful. Wide angle cam gives a new perspective altogether and super steady mode is jus to ooooo gooooddddd. Has a lot of other features which I need to test but initial impressions r great. Initial impressions - A good cam. Not the flagship type but a really capable one.

4. Battery - 6000Mah battery. I mean I'm sure I need not say anything further. But to give an idea, I set up the whole phone and installed a few apps only with a 2% drop. Jus goes to show that battery life is gonna be Monstrous. 15 watt charger takes 2.5 hrs to charge the 🔋 which is good considering the size.

5. Performance - The phone comes with the new Exynos 9611 processor which at least on benchmarks sits between the Snapdragon 660 &amp; 675. Plus what matters more is the software &amp; hardware synchronization. This being Samsung software &amp; hardware the general performance must be a lagfree and smooth one.

6. Software - The phone comes with Samsung's One UI built on top of Android 9 and trust me the UI is beautiful, light, feature rich and lovely to use. Easily one of the best UI which feel premium.good job Samsung.

Verdict - An excellent ph with an amazing battery a good cam, awesome display and decent build. Not to forget the brand value it carries with itself. Makes for a perfect buy this festive season. Gives u excellent value for ur buck.

1) Damn good battery back up for min 30 hrs for rugged usage and 48hrs for normal usage
2)Battery saver mode is a fabulous one which keeps your mobile alive for longer duration at low battery.
3) Dolby Atmos - No words to explain
4)  Amoled display - Awesome
5) very good movie and music experience
6) 48 MP triple camera for wide area capturing.
Samsung nailed it

It's a really nice phone but I was really worried about the battery as no matter how large a battery is if it cannot manage apps and programs properly it will be of no use even if it has 10000mAh battery but I was very much happy as it had a fantastic standalone time, the draining of battery was non existent, it works smooth, camera even though 48mp, was average, overall, worth the price, no regrets !

I am facing issue in calling and receiving. I am not able to call anyone. I have to reset my network using airplane mode and then I am able to make calls. I have to do this before every call. Even many times i am not able to receive calls. Again i have to reset my networks.

From beginning i am facing this issue some how it took me around 10-15 days to understand what is actually happening. Please help me out on this if this is software bug or my device is faulty.

Till now it's 1 week and I am satisfied with the product as expected. I would like to thanks Amazon and STPL Exclusive Online for the delivery on time.
You could have the specs which I liked and is actually there in this phone:
Camera - front 16mp- perfectly real 16mp camera
Back- 48+5+8mp yes real zooming and quality
Processor- exynos 9611 2.3ghz less lags and is smooth enough. Graphics is also good with the amoled screen.
Body- plastic- no one will give you at this rate and specs a glass back. Till now not fallen but it's hard enough for daily use.
Sound- noise control and clear bass and treble sound with dolby atmos.
So currently I will tell by this phone because you are not only getting Samsung brand but also tje specs that even Mi and Realme can't give in this price. Really happy with Samsung. Keep it up Samsung!!

Can say this is the only phone got best display and battery at this price range.Rear camera does its job well pics are awesome and steady videos with slow, super slow and hyperlapse are the special effects it comes with.

Front camera over image processing results in extra smoothen pics with more white resulting in less details - a software patch release might can fix this. Rear Plastic body and front no gorilla glass requires tempered glass and armour back case for protection.

This phone is not for everyone, especially not for gamers/camera freak. I am using this phone from last 5 days. Every phone has it's good and bad points.

PROS=
Battery (1.5 days with moderate use) No gaming at all*.
Amoled screen full HD
USB type C
15 watts charger at this price point (Same charger I got with Note9)
One UI is very smooth (No lag till now)
Slow motion video
4K video
Wide angle camera is good
Good weight distribution
Narrow besels
Good audio output via earphones. (Dolby atmos)

CONS:
48 mp camera is bit tricky, not so good.
Average build quality. (Very plasticky)
Should have given 18watts charger as it takes almost 3 hrs to full charge from 0.
False camera specifications.
Speaker output should have been increased.
Not given any back cover.
No gorilla glass protection.
Average processor Exynos 9611 = Snapdragon 665.

Verdict.
If you are looking for a gaming phone/camera centric phone then this is not ur cup of tea. This a all rounder which can handle day to day task with a massive battery. If I r looking for a good display, heavy battery back up and an average camera then go for it. Trust me it is better than MI, vivo,oppo and real me phones. Though I myself is a MI user.

*** All My family members do use Galaxy Note 9, POCO F1, Redmi Note 5, 6, 7, so I have compared this with all of them. U cannot find a better phone at RS. 11,600 currently.

Update-
Hotspot stopped working.
Signal reception very poor.
Heating issue.
Battery was draining fast.
So I sold it yesterday.

If u are camera lover then dont by this phone ....worst camera in indoor lighting...but outdoors its good
 Most good thing  is battery ....tum thak jaoge battery nahi
Display is best in class...
Performance also quite good ...there is no lag in any section
No heating problem
Music player is also good ...loud and clear audio ....
Clear calling voice i ever had...u literally feel difference..
The only disappointment is about camera in indoor conditions so if u are buying for 48mp then dont buy
But if u are looking for battery display better daily life use then go for it

Display of amoled and touch is very good..light weight.. battery looks like draining a bit fast lasting just above a day for 6000 mah battery as my previous MI max2 used to last 2days still with 5400 mah battery and LCD screen.. ram management is ok.. size of 6.4 inches but looks smaller to me.. processor of 9611 exynos is just ok, not comparable to snapdragon 710 also..
Finally for the price paid looks good to me..

I have it for 3 days. For Rs 13999 that's the best you can get. You cannot expect a S10 quality of camera. The phone is smooth, great battery and perfect finger print scanner. AOD works fine just like Note 9 or S10. The phone is fast surfing. Average call quality but that always depends on your operator too. 4g, volte supported. I use without 4g calling. Using Vodafone sim. 64 GB internal storage is fine after installing many apps and deleting bloatware. Recommended buy. Software updates are from 1.08.2019. Wake up Samsung.

Amazing phone in such a price segment. It gives you a feeling of a premier phone with such an awesome bezel free super amoled display. As it has Dolby atmos output, you get a real sound delight. Battery life is good, lasts for more than 18 hours on full charge. Camera is nice too, it works wonder when you have ample light to support your click. Touch is just perfect and transition between apps is also very smooth. Only place where I felt lag or latency issue is while making a call. Once you select a contact to dial, it takes 1-2 seconds to appear on the screen. Rest the phone is worth having.

A warning though, since it is bezel less, the screen glass is very delicate. If it falls, the glass at the top would definitely break. I got this phone on 2nd Oct. Since then my phone has fallen twice and both the times the glass broke. Even while I am writing this post, my screen has cracks on the surface :(. So guys if you really wanna use this phone, please get the screen protection done with good armored back cover.

Overall, I am happy with the phone. Kudos to samsung and Amazon team.

Samsung M30s 1 month usage review

Note - I'm an explorer, non-gamer and moderate user.
It's my detailed review, so it will take around 10-15min of your time to complete the reading.

My device - 6/128 Gb variant, Opal Black
Price - around 17k (bought it for 15.3 + 1k Amazon voucher)
I moved from MiUi(Redmi) to OneUI(Samsung)

I love more customization and features in the mobile, because of that I like MiUi. I heard that Samsung also done a wonderful job in OneUI and now it comes with mid-range mobile also. I like A series mobile, but due to price constraint I opted the M series.

Initial setup
 Based on other vlog &amp; blog feedback, I come to know that Samsung also provide advertisement on their mobile but we can turn off easily. So, I started Phone configuration by keeping it in mind and disabled or disagreed all the unwanted request by Samsung. Some of them are like - Marketing, Diagnosis data.
 I use to keep all my data backup in Google account backup so it automatically installed all my apps which are available in my old phone. This is really awesome. I only arranged / grouped the apps according to my need. I also avoided all Samsung's additional apps which it recommended.

User experience
OneUI
 User experience is one of the most day to day usage activity. In MiUi, I like their features for Calls (Recording), Screen capturing, screen recording, camera app, File explorer etc. Now, I noticed the same and more and less are available in OneUI. User experience is more comfortable in Samsung OneUI than MiUI. Also, noticed lot more features in Samsung, one example is Emergency mode which MiUi planning to introduce in MiUI 11.
 I went into each and every options in the settings and make sure that it is useful for me otherwise I disabled it. Because, if we allow more services in background it will eat your memory and battery.
 One bad thing with Samsung OneUI is most of the add-on custom features are payable like Fancy theme, fonts, AoD etc. There are free options available but very limited.
 Smart pop-up view in Samsung OneUI is lovely features like Windows OS.
 Even Though screen recording feature is not in Samsung, it has option to capture the screen scrolling and auto delete after sharing feature.
 Panic mode feature helps for girls/ladies. Pressing 3 times power key will send the information to configured contacts.

Performance
 I noticed flawless performance with day to day activity could be because of my 6gb RAM.

Handling
 It looks lengthy phone than(15.9cm) my earlier phone(14.9cm). Because of that I feel pain to handle for long calls (15+min). Watching videos are fine. But the phone badly need good grip cover otherwise it easily fall down. I'm waiting for the hardcover with stand. Still it is not available in the market. transparent cover helps me to handle properly but fail to use the 3.5mm port.

Call quality
 call quality with M30s is loud and clear, I usually reduce the volume when I'm in the silent place :).
 Network
 There is a myth that low SAR value device have bad network strength. That is wrong. I don't find any network issue with M30s it show the same level like my other Redmi Phone. One strange experience, I got it. i.e., I use to switch my network between 2g/3g/4g based on my location. When I keep my phone as 3g Only mode, it serve 4g data :).

Sound
  Ring Volume
 Speaker are loud and clear for calls ringtone / message even in Traffic location.
  Multimedia Volume
  Multimedia sound are good in silent room and average in loud region.
  YT Voice Volume (like audio shows)
  If you are hearing only voice from phone like audio shows it is bit difficult to hear. This could be multiple reason because usually that sounds are based on recording sound.
  3.5mm
 Good that the phone has 3.5mm instead of other ports. otherwise most of my accessories are useless. It serves good. I haven't experienced DAC kind of feelings so no comments.
  Bluetooth
 Initial days I noticed some trouble like after connecting to a device, it keep on scanning for other devices. But, now it is not like that. works perfectly. Sometimes, you need to provide permission approval on the phone screen while connecting to the device like Car Bluetooth Speaker for calls otherwise it will connect only for Multimedia.

Screen
 Screen is one of the reason I opted Samsung. Super AMOLED serves the fantastic services to me. Eventhough auto brightness update based on front camera it works perfectly fine.

  Multimedia
 Screen looks great if you watch any HD videos and more brighter in sunlight. If you need good multimedia experience, you should use earphone. built in speaker is not feels good with rich video.

Battery
 the mobile is made for 6k battery could be because of exynos 9611 processor, but we should know that it is just 2k additional to other 4k battery. which means just 50% more. The same way charging also 15w instead of 10w i.e. 50% more. So there will be no change in charging time 2hrs from 0% to 100%
 If you need long battery life, you need to tune the settings based on your requirements now and then. For e.g.: I always keep 2g network in mobile instead of 4g. Switch to 4g only if require mobile data. Otherwise, I'll be in Wifi it saves more battery. Enabled power mode in settings.
 I noticed heating issue when I roam around sunlight with 4g data.
 Based on my usage, battery life comes max of 3 days and during heavy usage of camera comes around 1 day also otherwise an average it comes with 2 days (100% to 20%).

Camera
 Both front and Back camera does the job wonderful. Camera application looks good like other UI app. quickly switch between camera.
 Hyperlapse, Slow motion and super slow motion are really wonderful option for recording videos with smooth processing without delay in saving.
 Eventhough it don't have front flash, we can use the screen as flash while taking selfie.

Fingerprint scanner
 One more reason I opted this device because of finger print scanner at backside instead of onscreen. It works faster and does the job without any delay.

Software update
 As per their website every quarter the security updates will push to the mobile. But no words about major updates. At Least OneUI 2.0 will come with Android 10 on this phone.

On Total I'll put 8.5 out of 10 for this mobile.
People who need bug-less mobile with long run can go for M30s.

The phone is extremely good in this price range.
Camera is excellent.
Battery life is like a beast it drains in 3 days after a normal usage.
Fingerprint sensor is slightly slow but working good.
Overall, the phone in this price range is just exceeding its limit and working excellently.

Faced a major problem with charging within a few days of purchase of he phone. It's taking hours to charge. When I gave it to Samsung's Authorized  service center, they changed the "charging strip" and assured me that the problem is resolved. Despite that, the phone is charging at a very low pace. Have again given the phone to the service center. I am now told that the phone's mother board needs to be changed and that it will take one week to order the mother board. Upon requesting for replacement of the phone with a new phone, they are unwilling to do so. Not sure whether the problem will be finally resolved or not.

Samsung is known for delivering some amazing displays and the Galaxy M30s tells the tale quite brightly. The phone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity-U display with a screen resolution of 2340 x 1080 pixels. The display offers own good colour reproduction and viewing angles are good as well. By default, the colours are muted, but you can switch to Vivid mode in the Display Setting to make it look punchier and colourful. The large screen makes the streaming experience a delightful one. We watched a couple of series on Galaxy M30s and we were satisfied with the display performance. The phone comes with Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.
Another area where the Galaxy M30s shines is the battery. The smartphone is equipped with a massive 6,000mAh battery and it comes with 15W fast charging support. The phone is currently the only one in this price segment that offers this much capacity. the phone easily lasted two days with an average screen time of 8 to 9 hours. When we stressed the battery performance by playing some games, streaming videos, using social media apps and for navigation, we still got almost one and a half-day of battery backup. The 15W fast charger was helpful for charging the phone within 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Better to charge the same 20-25% stage.

**Sufficient Storage 128 GB - great part add 256 memory card life long tension free

**Superhit Display FHD AMOLED 6.4" - what a display in this price range. With big brand name.

** on Jio wifi shows no lag in surfing and downloading [ mobile D/L speed better then wifi speed ]
*** sound quality louder,  clear also have Dolby sound option via headphones
Fingerprint sensor- face scan sensor excellent
.
.
The only problem I face with this mobile

Amazing phone with amazing display.
Very fast in opening any file or album.
Picture perfect camera with crystal clear pictures.
Easy to handle and light to carry.
Battery will last for long. It's like power bank.
Sound is too loud. You don't need speakers.
Value for money.
Though I have three samsung phones, this model is worth every penny.
Buy, you won't regret.

One of the best phone in this price range.
Pros:
Excellent battery life. Works for continuous for 36 hours, with data n gps on, after full charging.
Smooth n silky touch display, good colours and contast ratio. Warm light gives relax to eyes.
Sound quality good with dolby.
Personalisation is fun with lots of themes options and widgets, smart OS
Nice look n perfect grip.

Camera quality is not upto the mark.
Wide angle n super wide is good for landscapes.
But not good for portrait n family closeup.
Not good for macros also.
Check your preference.
Back cover is plastic, heats up soon. But gives firm hold.

Overall a good phone. If you are not a photography geek. Its an excellent choice in this price.

Perfect packing n delivery from amazon.
Received in time as described.

Pros :
1.Good camera quality and features like slomo and ultra slomo
2. Display is great

Cons:
1. Gets heated considerably when charging and when using for long time continuously, say an hour.
2. Fingerprint scanner is bad. Need to scan 2 to 3 times.
3. Sure bulky, feels like carrying a big soap bar. But it might be subjective, I feel it is heavy.

The Best From Samsung In Budget Series.. Talking About Display Super AMOLED displays are the best in the world which made by the World's Biggest Smartphone Company.. Talking About Battery Industry first 6000mah battery is there in the phone but the phone is very light and slim and easy to grip in hands.. power full battery last long for almost 28 hours by regular use also after playing PUBG.. The 48 mp Triple camera force to thinking us the picture quality beyond he imagination in Budget segment.. the ultra wide cam is best in class .. I have Specially bought this phone by showing it's flagship level specification Super Stedy mode.. Slow motion more over super slow motion video recording.. Hyperlapes is just awesome.. The 10 nm Exynos 9611 processor gives us power to play pubg in Ultra high graphics.. which have not offered by any other companies smartphone..

Phone is a beast on budget. With a 6000mAh battery, 48MP Triple camera and 18W Fast Charging, it's a best with budget phone. Also the software updates are so regular. The Phone comes with a 6.4 inch sAmoled display with a 93% screen-body ratio (19.5:9) and a powerful in-house Exynos 9611 SoC processor.
Battery is great and the phone is even greater.
It'd have been a great great successful phone if only they had added on-screen fingerprint sensor. Rest all is good.

Pros - Many but shadowed by one basic function of having mobile.... network  signal.
Cons- Network  issue . Very poor connectivity with airtel. Wait until the issue is resolved else you will get frustrated .
Same place other phone is having enough 4g signal and this one fighting  for network.
What will you do with battery and amoled screen without internet.

Camera- too much hype , it'normal .also you can only exchange  it . You can't return.

I was in search of mid range Mobile with all features, battery backup and brand name.
After comparison multiple smartphone on multiple e commerce site. Finally I take my call with m30s. The phone 📱 is light weight with 6000mah power battery backup. No issues till date regarding performance, battery and all other.
 If you are looking for mid range phone with performance, battery backup and camera quality. I recommend this phone

So i tried this phone for 3 days and i am in love with the features it offer at such a price my. Main highlight was the 6000 mah battery . It is superb and i charge my phone only once in 36 hours still working good . The charging is fast and the camera is also good for the price .
 I had my doubts after reading several reviews but i must say this is a worth buying phone so many awesome features and it runs smoothly.

This phone is great but some issues.
Pros-
1)Monster battery life, even heavy usage it gives me 1.5 days battery life.
2)Cameras are really good in this price point. Yes, some issues like lack of details (but who zoom too much) and average low light photography. But of course in this price point you can't expect top notch camera, then what will be the flagship phone who gave top notch quality in 12MP only.. I am impressed with it's super slow motion, night mode and super steady mode which are really helpful
3)This phone has monster display which quality is really good.
4)Smooth performance good for day to day task. I am not heavy gamer but it's performance is really good
5)I love One UI. No ads. User friendly UI for work
6)Call sound quality is really good

Cons-
1)This phone has poor build quality. Creepy sound at back panel. I think it's for it's 6000mAh battery to better weight distribution
2)Network related issues. Downloading speed is not too much. But now a days jio Internet quality is decreasing. Haven't switched airtel or other providers
3)Wifi hotspot related issues. I use amazon fire tv stick. U I use my phone as a hotspot. Phone get heated when share Internet through hotspot but after update heating issue resolved. But it still slow in hotspot rendering speed compare to my Galaxy On Max. Sometimes video quality goes down on my fire tv for low Internet speed and hotspot rendering.. Then phone struggle and got heated.
4)Battery drain when hotspot rendering
5)When use smart view video stuck. Waiting for next update to solve those issues .

while travelling if use your phone for 10min means mobile getting heating around front camera. And also battery draining very fast screen on time 4 hour - almost 60-65 % battery was drained.

On oct 10 i ordered my 1st m30s from my friend account. In that mobile i faces heating issue &amp; battery draining problem. I got replacement. In that i did not face heating issue but battery draining very fast. That I returned &amp; ordered new m30s from my avcount again. In this new mobile still battery draining faster then older m30s mobile.

Worst mobile in samsung histroy.

It really has a monstrous battery. If you are a frequent traveller and do not want to keep looking for the charging points, then this is the phone you need to own. The camera is amazing and phone feels so light in hand. Got it at a great deal during The great Indian festival. If you are looking for a 48 MP camera and that too within budget, then you should go for this phone. It has got all the sensors- accelerometer, magnetometer and gyro, you can check the orientation just for fun.

Camera quality is very bad. It seems like 2 megapixel camera. I used mi phone earlier so this time thought to purchase a Samsung phone. Amazon should check what company assures to deliver and what actually delivered. Very bad camera quality and built up material. Never buy this phone. Samsung started to cheating people by giving false information.

Used the phone for 2 weeks and here are my observations:
Display - Although samsubg says that M30S is FHD, it does not reflect on the product. Video and display are nothing special and does not feel Full HD

Battery- 6000MAh, Retains for a longer time as it should. But, chargibg is very very slow. Not Ultra Fast as has been advertised.

Camera- For 42 MP not a good quality. Even 15MP camera on my Motorola phone has a better quality. Selfie Camera is not very good either.

Processor- Its not Snapdragon, so not very fast but gets the job done with some frustration.

Samsung ONE UI OS: Not very good.

I understand these are not exciting reviews. I purchased the phone because amazon advertised is so much, but the reality is that it is not a flagship phone, all features just sort of work and are not very great.
My advice would be to invest some more money and go for other brand phones

I was using POCO F1, then i switched to this phone even though the processing is no match with POCO F1, but it didn't disappoint me in any aspect.
The biggest advantage is of battery life.
After using LCD phone for quite long time, i am impressed with super AmoLed display of this phone.
It's not even heavy considering this giant capacity battery.
I liked it's Always on Display with various customisation.
I purchased this on sale and got it for INR 12600.
At this price segment, i have no complain on any of it's feature instead i am happy with it.
No lag at all.

Very bad product and I got damaged product it's corners were not good when I tightly hold my finger than some noise is coming I think it's not damaged but because of the body but it has very bad camera so please don't buy for camera it is only made for watching videos and sound. Is good videos are good because of super amoled display and sound is good because of Dolby Atmos only when it is connected with headphone or earpiece. Battery backup is very poor. I suggest don't invest your money on this and very bad respond from Amazon the replace is also not available. Please if your Samsung m30s body sound is coming when you hold then tell me I think it was because of polycarbonate maybe.

I got in the amazon sale couple of weeks back
The phone is doing awesome
I have complaints against the camera quality  cause I had been using iPhone 5s which was having  good camera quality then m30s
I know apple cannot be comparable with Samsung but it's an evident difference.
Battery life is awesome.
With ample amount of space you can ignore few of the inbuilt apps
Or just force stop them to make them silent and drop into a single folder which you won't open.

Best phone to be purchased in this price segment. The camera performs extremely exclient, even apps like Snapchat qnd Instagram gave impressive results by the camera. The battery life is unmatchable with any other phone. The face recognition sensor is impressive and works very accurately at the night. The finger print sensor is fast and the phone reverts it back quickly. The touch quality of the phone is unbelievable, it got fether like touch screen. In short it's the best phone to be purchased in this price segment.

Awesome display, sound output over bluetooth and over headphone Jack. I am able to use this phone for 2 days without recharge. When I used my earphone with phone, I was astonished with the sound quality and clarity it is having. It is almost like use DAC. Phone speakers are ok ok. Please note you won't get Dolby in speakers. You can use Dolby output in bluetooth and headphone Jack output.
Display quality is the best. Videos and games will look good to the eyes.
I observed that fingerprint sensor is little bit slow but it is ok as long as it is secure. I will prefer security over speed.
Camera is not that great. You can get good pics in daylight  but in low light pics are not that good. Video stabilization is the best ever seen.
Personally I found One UI satisfying. It have good memory management,  good process management than other phones like redmi and real me. Plus one one UI comes with flagship features which you can use in this phone.
Games performance is good.(redmi note 8 pro is better due to its graphics processor but this have better visuals and optimum performance).
In the end I'll recommend this phone to all types of users. Specially to who lives Netflix and music.

"The perfect package" is what I would call this masterpiece by samsung . Lets list the Pros first
1 Screen : The screen size is perfect in the range of all competitors with u notch display it does what it is supposed to .
2 Face detection/unlock: It is slick and work with low light too .
3 Battery Life : A decent 2 day battery backup for regular internet usage and calling  cant comment for the gaming community though.
4 Fingerprint sensor : Better than the face detect but its akward position on the rear of phone does make it a less of choice to use
Cons :
1 Finding fitting and actual accessories for new launch phones is a mess you can not rely on unreviewed products and it takes time to get hands to real deal . I got my self a M30 back cover which as expected is not meant for this phone and cover the flash as well as the Fingerprint sensor.
HOPE it helps

Likes- look and feel, mobile functions like touch sensitivity, status bar enhancement, speed in terms mobile reacts when you choose something on screen.

Dislikes- mobile camera is not upto the mark, it is not s-amoled screen as mentioned on the box, status bar notifications like time, mobile signals and wifi status is not completely showing top portion is covered with black end points. Which is why I am disappointed and not sure whether this is the case with others as well. It that is the case then Samsung has to rectify this glitz with patch updates

Best mobile for lost cost budget.. it is working so perfectly.. I planned it for my parents.. but after using this mobile I gave my iPhone to my mom and I kept Samsung galaxy M30s as my personal mobile.. the best part is face recognition.. in low light also it is work so perfectly.. in sleep if open for my msges.. it will be unlocked without switching on lights.. With Amazon sale.. I got it for a perfect price and Amazon cash back and sbi cash back also.. thanks to Samsung Galaxy M30s and Amazon great India sale..

Phone is ok...
But there are lot of problems specially in network department.. i use airtel 4g but i bearly get any 4g network,,, it always switch to 3g automatically...internet speed suffers call quantity suffers...i use jio as well and it also faces same problem... Camera hardware is good but lacks clearity.. and i am not even comparing with copitation it is simply bad....
Build is bad..
Vibration callibration is worse..
Auto brightness is worse..
Sound via speakers are bad(low)...
I don't think any of these problems could be fixed by ota update....
So think hard befor buying...
I can't recommend it.......

The phone is really good in the price range, I like the processor, the camera, dual smart 4G, exactly what I wanted.

And the battery, my God it is HUGE.

I don't know if it has gorilla glass or not so I have got a tempered glass protector anyway.

Samsung chat support claims it does but nowhere it is written about gorilla glass.

10% discount and Rs 1000 cashback. It was a very good deal.

Haven't had the chance to use the camera but I've used the phone a lot.

Whatever issue with gaming you'd have in a Qualcomm processor phone in this price range, you'd have less in this Exynos. I have played NFS No Limit on this I have played it on a Qualcomm based phone too.

Maybe that's why there is a game booster because they know what it lacks and have tried to make some provisions to overcome that.

I have used 4G in both the slots and have used it as a mobile hotspot 24x7 and still do for my other devices.

Fast charging a very good too.

A click is felt everytime I hold this is the right hand, it was mentioned in one of the video reviews too on YouTube so a back cover is highly recommended, i had one  but now I am using it without it as I am home mostly.

Sapphire Blue is what I had ordered and I am glad to have made that choice, it looks really good. I am now looking for a transparent back cover.

Highly recommended phone in this price range.

I am a Nokia phone user so far. I have purchased this phone last week. The phone is looking great on design. But its plastic body.. benifit is less heat emitting. Batry performance is quite super long time. Fringer print readers  is very active and fast predicting one. Face recognizing is not 100% good. It cant recognize on dim light but it can fastly recognize in  day light and front clear view..Camera is very natural no color enhancement so I was beaten when I compared photos taken with my friends phone even its 48 mp, but first natural photographer will praise it for photo detail in it. Game performance is unbelievable unbeatable.. my friends look with jawdropping experience.
Fast performance even opening so much apps downloading at a time . Happy to have this phone. I suggest this phone for my 7 friends Four of them are buying it after using my phone m30s. Great experience.  Am sharing from my own experience.. thank you guys..

Camera: RearVery good, front ok
Battery: Good but light heating problem
Screen : Superb
Speed: Fantastic
Finger print reader : very fast working.
Network coverage: Very fine
Amazon delivery: Good. I paid through Amazon upi to get 1000 cash back. But it showed payment not successfull . Then i cancelled the order and booked fresh order for COD 16999.00. After that  the UPI amount got debited from my bank. After two days  the amount got credited. But finally i didn't get 1000 cash back. So UPI payment is very bad.
Totally very good phone for this price range.  Mine is pearl white 6 GB 128 gb

The Samsung galaxy M30S is a new competitor in the budget phone segment, i wont go deep on the features as they are already mentioned here and elsewhere, instead i will tell you how my experience was and what i think of the phone in general.I bought this phone for my mother, so i will also tell you how user friendly it is for people who are still not used to the smartphone era, like our parents and elders.

So starting with the build quality, the build quality is good, but not excellent, nowadays phones are coming back with all plastic body, and the plastic here feels a bit flimsy, mostly the frame, it doesnt feel tight like previous plastic phones we would get, so that can be improved on future models, but since mostly all of us use some kind of protection cover, it doesnt really matter, but the quality can be improved.
Next thing would be how user friendly it is to use, well UI of the new android and samsung is good and simple, but i think the sensitivity of the touch screen is too sensitive, the problem with the new phone screens in general is there is no bezel or edge on the borders, so even a touch by mistake cannot be avoided in some cases,  this is a problem for me as well as senior people, as i myself have tried these screens for the first time, but getting used to it and a cover with elevated edges should fix the problem if its a problem for anyone.
Besides these drawbacks, the phone is good purchase, but the build quality of the body can be improved, besides the rest of the build quality is excellent, cannot complain with samsung. from my opinion, i would rate this phone a 4.5/5 stars.

Delivery of Phone was super fast. I got it the very next day. Phone specifications are impressive on cards.
Speed - Ok kinds, there is some lag in bigger applications
Camera - biggest let down..none of the pics I clicked verifies 48 MP..this is a big time falasy. Infact, i have a One plus 5, 2 year old which is still giving better quality pictures than this one
Build - screen is fine, back side of phone looks better in picture. It is of plastic material and looks cheap.
I will prefer an MI phone over this.

Camera takes a bit of time to focus, which makes pictures on the go, get blurred sometimes. However the picture quality is very good. The wide angle helps in getting most of the area captured. The battery lasts for a day and half, although I am not a heavy user. Ideally for me it should last for two days. My earlier Samsung A8+ battery lasts for a day even after one and half years.

Overall I am very happy with the product.

I reviewed one month after use of this m30s ....its really a monster.....Samsung give us a very good mobile with super spec
Pros.
1.the sAMLOD display is crystal clear and give a v.good experience while using
2.the battery life is pretty good which gives one day backup while complete use
3.camera quality is perfect but front camera is slightly lower than expected bt good enough
4.the built quality is pretty good I purchase opal black which is lovable
5.charging speed is good  enough
6. Audio quality and video quality is awesome
Cons.
1.this is not a gaming mobile.it supports all games but the smoothness while playing games get collapsed like (pubg...)
2.Finger print sensor not works accurately this is much irritating while use no update to fix the issue

Delivery was super fast by amazon, I received it next day before 11AM. Look and feel of phone was not as expected based on advertisement. its a plastic body, but looking at cost its OK. I had a problem with handset as it was not accepting vodafone SIM. When i checked over social media few of my friends reported the same problem. When i visited Samsung service center, they were clueless about problem and advised me to initiate return request via amazon, but i called up samsung CC and they advised me to deposit phone with service station and they advised them to get it rectified. Next day when i visited service station they said its working fine and they have updated the binary. still when i inserted my SIM, the problem was still there. I again used network reset option and then i can see network. Overall phone is OK but has some basic problems with look and feel due plastic body coupled with battery heating up. such a huge battery still it last for 24 hours only with moderate usage. Overall is OK phone, but looking at cost its good deal.

Purchased with good expectations as this is highlighted with 6000 mAh battery but infact this is giving hardly 12 hours back up only which already I had with my another phone which is 3000mAh battery.
Camera is also not upto a great level of capturing and as usual with Samsung slight heating problem is feeling  . Design is good but performance is just average and not an advisable one to purchase.
Call volume is also seemingly lower but it might be a design good up of speaker position.

After buying M30S on the launch day and getting it delivered the same day is just an amazing experience.. thanks to Amazon Prime membership..
using it for almost a week of its lauch day writing a detailed review of its overall experience..

Pros :
1. The elegance and the look it has makes it compete with the premium S series from Samsung.. that's a premium look at mid range along with Samsung Badging makes the stance.
2.The display is simply awesome , the sAmoled display with above 400ppi speaks for itself.
3.The front camera is picture perfect to do a neat job.
4. The exynoss 9series processing is a jump needed for the 48mp camera but the other way it works smooth with the Samsung UI even with almost 100 aps installed and with multitasking 10 aps.
5. Am not a game freak, but just wanted to test its gaming capabilities and the mobile didn't upset nee either and delivered quite a good performance in subway surfers and temple run.
6. 6000mah battery stands for around 2 days of Normal usage providing to work in the go and doesn't remind about the power bank quite often on travel.

Everything has pros and cons.. so here are the

Cons:
1.The camera needs to be tweaked.. the output isn't what's expected from Samsung mobile. The 48 MP rear camera performs very decent but not to the Samsung standard. There is a 48mp mode in aspect ratio which is the only option to extract the 48mp output.

2.The battery has fast charging but that even takes 3 hours to charge from 1% to 100%.. I can understand but fast charging is not fast enough..
3.The polycarbonate finish and the color tone I personally didn't like it.

Final thoughts..
a really value for money mobile.. If you are brand conscious, you ll not regret the purchase of Samsung M30S.

This phone has some serious network issues. The same SIM when put into some other phone shows 80 to 100% network but in this phone it shows 50 to 60%. Call drops and voice stuck ups over a call are quite frequent. Rest all features are top notch but it is very unlike samsung to undermine such a basic phone feature. I've not used any cover and tried every setting I could but still this issue exists. I hope samsung fixes this through some software patch.

First of all i would like to pay thank to samsung that this company launched a great phone m30s for mobile freakzz @under ₹15000 segment,
yeah! A Monster!! Truely ... Affordable.
Well-done! Samsung👍👍👍👍👍

Lets figure its missing out features cons now..... I am missing some functions in Samsung Galaxy m30s 👇
1. Screen video recording.
2. One touch icon for capturing screen shots in notification panel.
3. Sound quality is not up to the mark while listening in wired earphone through 3.5 mm audio jack. ( 6 out of 10 marking for it)
4. Camara quality both front and rare are not up to the mark ( 8 out of 10 marking)
5. In keyboard it's vibration function does not work.
6. While fast Charging mobile is getting bit heat issue occurred.
7. Company should have provided back cover and earphone along with phone.
8. Samsung m30s must have an option that is called "Private Space" 👍
...I hope samsung will fullfill all most wanted requirements to become mobile company of the year 2019, in next coming update ( Of UI&amp;Android version Q) in Samsung m30s.
Thanks,

U all must have seen various vidoe loaded on you tube for this phone reviews
Here r points not coverd

1)Phone is heatting wen it is kept on charge
Battery life is suppose to be big and shuld last for 2 days with heavy usage but it is not the case it drains as like normal 3k Mh battery

Need to take care and keep a watch  again and agin is samsung galaxy store is updating something or installing
3)Also it doesnt show network speed
4) No date nor time u need to scroll down the screen
6) phone comes with only charger which wire is short
5) pricing is correct nt cheap as u have to buy headphones screen gaurd and it doest even give rubber case all adds up 1500 minimum more to phone

The battery is very good, durable battery life. Camera quality is very good by using 48MP camera in night it clicks very clear images,high resolution videos recorded and records video in 4k also face unlock reacts very fast also reacts fast in night. Fingerprint reacts very fast. Processor is very fast for gaming like pubg and Call of duty, not getting hang. Also there are more features in this mobile as compare to others in this price. It's a very powerful phone.
I recommend all the viewers Samsung M30S.

I gave 1 star because of the poor quality check of Samsung. I got the device with tiny bulges around the black bead between the body and display.

Hey Samsung,
It's time to upgrade or change your entire quality control team and don't make business with any company to install their app on your mobile phone which cannot be uninstalled by the customers even if it's not an important and useless app like Netflix, Facebook etc. At least you should give an option to uninstall them if the customers don't need them. You should change these things immediately if you don't want to fall from your top ranking again as this happened before.

Hey Amazon,
You need to change your replacement policy unless you wish to loose your customers due to the desperation of online shoppers.

The second day of usage,I dropped the mobile from a 2 feet height, it feel on a concrete floor and the display broke badly along with the rear camera glass and few scratches on the back, I called the service center and they told it will take 3 months for them to receive the spare for this product as it launched just a week before. The mobile is very fragile, poor build plastic at the rear, I was using Asus Zen phone Max pro M1 which I played like football, feel lot of times from a charger level height it still intact, don't expect Xiaomi or Asus level durability in this mobile.. Its a awesome fancy mobile,till you drop it once :-)

I am updating my review after 2 months of usage. During a phone call the speaker automatically turns-on. This happens randomly and I have to tap speaker button 2 times during the conversation. All good features are of no value if one cannot make a proper call with the phone. Contacting Samsung support was of no help - as they advise testing in safe mode. Deal breaker for me

I m gonna give my honest review .. this is very nice phone .. it get charged  from 0 to 100% in 2 hours and battery lasts for 1 and half day moderate use.. worst point  is camera.  rear camera is good but selfie camera worst . If you want good selfies please opt out but other features are really good like

Samsung M30s is a budget phone.
But it disappointed me. Front and Rear camera's picture quality is too bad, so much noisy picture captured it, even you zoom it , you didn't see clearly. Video quality good, but there is also noisy. When captured with 48mp option, it take long time to save the picture,even slow motion video take long to save.If you connect your phone with WiFi and saw movie or playing games then 6000mah will be short for 1day lasting; otherwise it will back up your phone for 40-50 hours for normal usage, only take calls,chats, taking pictures etc etc.
Display quality superb, online content watching in this phone awesome. Samsung must improve or fixed camera quality by software update, otherwise it does not sell in future.

I'm new to sAMOLED mobile. It looks bit reddish/warm, but finally adjusted to it. Since beginning, the display gives stunning, true to life view experience.  Loved fantastic black (true black). Battery is okay. Camera is good with excellent dynamic range &amp; good wide angle too. 48MP camera is great in good light conditions. It is very much similar to Redmi Note 7pro camera. But with great punchy colours, the image looks bit more lovely. Samsung OneUI 1.5 is excellent experience. Waiting &amp; excited about OneUI 2.0. Due to its plastic body &amp; unspecified glass, good tempered glass &amp; flip cover is recommended. Hence build quality is negligible. Audio feel is also good with DolbyATMOS. Thanks Samsung for the beautiful product at less price. Keep up &amp; bring more such updated product in M series.

Phone looks Cool and Excellent at it's 1st impression.i got 4+64 @ price of 12600 RS .so it's a good deal at that cost.camers quality is excellent from both worlds.display is crisp and vibrant thanks to it's 6.4 inch SAmoled display.Sound quality is Good.Had a Type C port with 15watt fast charger in the box.bt remember there is no Back case and screen guard in the box.Back side looks like cheap quality material i.e plastic feeling.yet it has dual color gradient design... Performance is good and you can play high end games seamlessly. Though it can't beat Redmi Note 7 pro and Realme 5 pro in performance ratio.
Pros-
1. Excellent Display
2. Best battery
3. Best Cameras
Cons-
1. No back cover and screen guard in box
2. Back side feels cheap in hand

I've been using this phone for about a month now, and it is a perfect phone as per my needs and regular usage. The phone looks good and has decent plastic build but it still requires a cover and screen guard as plastic body is prone to slipping from hands of this model. Screen quality is quite good and has further  color adjustment options in settings which one can tweak according to their liking. As for the system software it comes with android 9 with One UI and it performs quite good and has a good user interface and it offers its own VPN service as samsung max built inside the phone for private usage. Performance wise it is quite good and has no lags or delays, hauling exynos 9611 under the hood, I've played pubg and call of duty on it and I've managed to get away with about high settings without any noticeable lag, maybe thanks to its game booster but it performs quite well. And it comes with a 6000MaH battery which is quite monstrous and can easily get away with 2 days of normal usage literally. Even if you are a hardcore user then also it will easily get away with a full day's usage. The speakers of this phone are quite good and loud.
Regular camera is quite good and can go toe to toe with any other mobile phone at this price range both with images and video recording as it has plenty of options for tweaking camera settings for recording and capturing still images.
The camera on paper sounds quite good but in reality it has some flaws, though not that big of an issue considering its price but its super slow motion has some flickering of video, now this can be solved via a software update but as of now this problem exists and also the primary camera's night shots are okay but secondary camera quality in night mode is not what I'd expected but I'm guessing samsung had to cut corners somewhere to get to this price point.
All in all this phone holds quite a value for money and it can easily secure its place among the best phones at the mid price range of Rs15-20000. And it has a dedicated memory card slot which was my one of the main buying points for this phone along with the hardware configuration. If you are looking for a good phone to play games on and with the assurance of good company to backup the claims then this phone will definitely satisfy your needs.

Excellent product within the budget.
Pros:
1. Battery life too good
2. Sleek and handy
3. Good photo capture capacity specifically for landscape. Very good depth.
4. Bluetooth and wifi are working perfect
5. Sound is also great.
6. Very good speed for all apps.

Cons:
1. Camera for group picture, squeeze the edge part. Blur effect is good but edge of photos are not good.
2. Selfie is so so. It should have option to in selfie , the mirror effect removal.
3. Back body should be more durable.

Suggetsion: need to improve camera specially selfie.

Writing this review after 10 days of usage.
Pros:
1. Camera-One of the best in class, superb low light photography
2.Display-Brilliant color saturation. Thanks to Samsung for Amoled at this price bracket
3.Battery-Easily last for 2 days with normal usage and more than a day with heavy usage
4.Heating-No heating issue. Phone remains cool with heavy gaming
Cons:
1.No led notification (although thats the case with most of the bezel less displays)
2.Charging could've been faster. 15W adapter isn't enough for a 6000mAh battery!
But considering the price, it's an all in one package. Pleasantly surprised with Samsung😊

Bought this phone on 21st January, 2020
First, this phone is ment to be kept in house.
This phone is not at all ment for new generation.
In my life I have used Lava, Motorola, Micromax, iPhone and then One-Plus but the worst experience I got was with this phone.

Now everybody would be wondering, why am I telling this.
Guys, before buying the phone we checked the specifications and then we buy it but there is one thing which we would not be able to get is the build quality. I bought the 1 year Damage Protection Plan and in March while we walking on the road, phone fell down and the screen was broken, I thought might be the impact was high due to which screen broke down, so I called for the protection and the service was good and the phone got repaired. Now while there was Covid 19 Lockdown, the phone fell from bed on the floor and then again the screen got broke.

Can you imagine that phone fell from bed and broke the screen.

I have used number of phones of different brand and number of times the phone fell here and there but nothing happened, but this phone is so brittle, so brittle that the screen gets crack by falling from bed.

So I would not at all recomend for new generation to buy this phone, where as this phone can be gifted to old people if they never use it.

This is my story with phone rest is in your hand

The product is amazing, I was looking for a mobile with large battery and wanted to go with a handset with 5000mah battery, but when this beast was launching with 6000mah, I waited for this as it had a better screen sampled, better processor  and great value for money, this has given all competitors a very healthy competition. I have 6GB 128gb version, wanted to opt for realme XT but have chosen this for battery..... also got good discounts.
Have not given 5stars as Samsung could have included a back cover with this but they wanted to save a few bucks here which is very disappointing.

Plastic body which is flimsy and wobbly. Not expected at this price point. Lot of Bloatware. Amazon will not refund but only exchange. Feel cheated by Amazon and Samsung. Please do not buy unless you see the phone at an outlet or someone having one.

Value for money.
Pros:

1. Looks quite appealing and stylish.
2. Screen display is very crisp &amp; produces good colors. Viewing angles are good.
3. Visibility is great in day and night.
4. Touch response is good. UI is neat &amp; elegant and user friendly.
5. Value for money.
6. Stands out among its competitors.
7. Comes with Brand trust.
8. Screen sharing is very easy with smart TV's.
9. Good battery backup(6000mAH).  Lasts easily for about 2days on moderate use.
10. Phone is very light compared to the size of battery.
11. Dual sim management is good compared to competitors

Cons:
1. Sound quality is average
2. Phone is slippery.
3. Difficulty using single handedly.
4. Charger cable is too short.
5. Full charge timing is very long.
6. Fingerprint reader location is too high at the back. Not easily reachable for samll hands. Onscreen finger print reader would be great if provided.
7. Not good for gaming. Good for overall usage
8. Low light photos after not great trends to smoother.

Overall it's a great phone for this price.  Cons are very picky compared to the pros. I highly recommend this phone if your primary usage is for calls, social media and entertainment(videos). Not recommended for intensive gamers. It's a bestbuy at this price.

Great value for money phone if you are looking this one as secondary phone or even as primary one. Battery life is great charge once and forgot for 2 days almost . Camera is good and improvements required through Software update to make it better . It's processor can handle any task thrown at him be it games, multi tasking or watching HD videos. Amoled screen best in industry always fun to watch Netflix , Hotstar , Amazon prime. If you are considering this to buy go for 6gb Ram variant as extra 2 gb always come handy in day to day usage . At last most value for money in this price segment with scope of improvement through timely software updates.

Software issue, some of the apps closes on it's own after 5 seconds.
Camera not satisfied, I believed in not buying China phones thinking that Samsung was best but the Chinese phones takes good pictures.
Battery looks to be ok, not sure if it's the power of 6000 mah
Overall... this phone doesn't match its competitors.
Probably it's made in India  previous Samsung phones were made in Vietnam so that they worked well for many years with 8mp camera which was super cool.

Never buy this phone if you want good camera, with 48 mp camera u can just shot big pics no sharpness no edge detection no proper color reproduction, daylight pics seems like a watercolor painting, 6000 mah battery is good n display is also good.
From day 1 fingerprint sensor is working randomly some times working some times not, too many bloatwares but removable.
Built of plastic so no points for that.
My 1st n .. last samsung phone ever...

Update1 After 7Days Use - Samsung UI in this phone is very buggy data switching from sim1 to sim2 n viceversa taking too much time, also data on off n flightmode taking hell lot of time...

Update after 20days use - suddenly screen got black and service center is asking for 6k to replace the screen this is how samsung n service centers looting people, will never again buy any samsung product..

This is first time I am using rear finger print. I am Samsung user from last 6 years. My first samsung phone was Samsung Galaxy S duos. I have seems Samsung Phone processor and Camera quality improvement by using Samsung Galaxy S Duos, Samsung Grand, Samsung J7, and my last Samsung phone was Samsung J7 Pro. That I am still using. What should I say about battery life of this Samsung M30s. I think Samsung should have given it as external battery so that people can use it as generator once there is no light at home.... hhahahah. Jokes apart. Its reallly a worth spending money.
Finger Print sensor can recognise even a small touch.
Camera: One of the best camera provided by Samsung till date.
Battery life: it really suits its tag line. #GoMonster# can lasts for 2 days if used under normal conditions.
I was confused between RealmeXT and Samsung M30S. But my past experience and aftersale service of Samsung forced me to stay will Samsung again and I think I have made a right choice. Kudos Smasung and Amazon.
Especial thank to Amazon for giving me this phone for approx 14600 Rs and 1000 Amazon pay money. THANKS..

I have received this phone @9:00 AM Today.
It took me around 1 hour to update all applications and play with all the functions of this beast.

I can definitely say that you gonna love this phone.

After using continuously for 2 hours, I am writing my initial review here.

Pros:
1) Great Battery 🔋 (Drained just 12% in 2 hours)
2) Camera is Awesome. Wide Angle Camera provides great photos.
3) Look and Feel is ultimate and gives eligent feel while handling the phone.
4) Performance wise looks good and no such lag observed while using it.

Cons:
1) Initially found that phone is heating a bit but that was due to all syncing and updating the apps. Otherwise it is completely normal.

Apart from that, I haven't found anything to worry about till now.
Surely update this review once I will use it for longer time.

It's a decent phone there is little bit heating issue hope they will fix it soon by softwareupdate ..camera is decent ..battery is good enough but doesn't meet the expectations. Battery backup is almost similar to 5000mah battery . But when its come about Display , Samsung does no compromise here...its just awesome.  And Samsung one ui is one of the best UIs ..I got this in 11600 so it is awesome phone for me ...If u got this for 12599 or below  then just go for it as soon as possible.  But in 13999 there are better options in the market...

Note - I am upgrading from Moto G5S Plus, hence you will probably find comparisons throughout.

Display is really awesome. Super clear, vivid colors and aspect ratio. This is my first FHD+ display, totally blown away with the quality.

Performance is pretty smooth (6 GB version), without any lags. Seamless viewing and browsing experience.
Camera quality is good as well. Slow mode works nicely, low light photography is also pretty good, considering the price point (13K during sale).

Speakers are not great. On my moto, it is way better. And i really dont like the UI. Moto G5s Plus has a stock android, and to be honest once you get used to stock android, any UI doesn't really suit you anymore. Phone actions are much better on Moto, and i really miss those. All parts of the phone are easily accessible, not so much in the Samsung.

COming to the Phone's USP, the Battery. Let me describe it in one word - Pathetic. 6000 mAh doesnt last a day with full usage. Whereas, Moto G5S+ has 3500, it lasts 1 day easily, with gaming, even after 2 years. It probably is because of UI optimizations, but still. Fast charging is not really fast charging, 3-4 hrs for a full charge (without using the phone while charging)

It's definitely not for pure gaming. Battery life depends on our daily uses. It gives a battery life of 1 and half day on heavy use with all day internet. Camera quality is decent with nice performance. It's screen is obviously the best. I like it's dark mode. Face recognition is better than fingerprint sensor. Operating system is  user friendly. Most important protect this phone with a good quality back cover as this is going to break possibly and will get scratches on it's back easily.

I have used  m20, m30 &amp; a70  before using m30s all i can say, it is what you have paid for .... few things i am mentioning here that can be bothered you...

No Security  after unlock the handset means no further app lock is pre installed as other brand gives.
Camera is 48 Mp but seems not like that &amp; Front is also not that good ... but if you see the bugdet &amp; brand  you need to setisfy your self...
 18 W adaptor would be better to charge such a huge battery because 15 W takes 2hr 40 m to 50min to charge but last long enough &amp; this is awesome

 Some good things
Fingerprint work fast
Dispay qaulity Vibrant
Samsung Interface &amp; features are always rocking

I recommend you. ......  ....Go For It .....

This is one of the best budgest phones of Samsung in recent times. This phone could have been a budget phone giant slayer(xiaomi) if Samsung had used a better quality front sensor. Overall a really nice phone.

Pros.
1.Best battery life thanks to 6000mAh battery size.
2.Rear 48MP camera is also good.
3.Samsung scored well with respect to Sleek design even with a gigantic 6000mAh battery.
4. 128GB storage and Super AMOLED display makes the binge watching of shows on Amazon prime and Netflix.
5. Touch sensitivity is faster than the other M series phones.
6. New processor is quite fast.

Cons
1. Lacks Samsung S bike mode.
2. Speaker volume is bit low.
3. Though Samsung has provided fast charger, it takes longer time to charge phone.
4. Front camera could have been better. Photo quality of front camera is average.

So, how do I start. Everything in this mobile is great. What surprised me is that all these features came in an aggressive pricing and made by Samsung.

Firstly, the looks. It looks so slim even as it holds a massive 6000 mAh battery. I am a normal user and battery have me nearly two days, which is great. Rating 5/5

Performance wise there are no lags or Grange drop. Rating 5/5

Camera is excellent. I took few shots which came out amazing. A little bit improvement is needed, but even as of now this is cool. I am already using M20, but this is far better, which have some decent shots. Night mode is great and image shows a lots of details. Wide shots are more wider compared to M20 and image quality is also a lot better. I have also recorded a super slow motion video of reason and just looks amazing. We can see every single drop off rain in the video. Night images with flash came out great. I cannot say anything about daylight photos. These images are just out of thought. Images look so sharp and clear. Closeup shots looks great. It would be good if macro feature is also available. Rating 5/5

Coming to display, in one word, Superb. Screen is massive and looks good in hand Touch is buttery smooth. No one would say anything about Samsung's AMOLED display. Its just great. Rating 5/5.

Sound is crystal clear and loud enough. Rating 5/5

No heating issues yet as I am not a heavy gamer.

Overall, this is beast mobile on an aggressive pricing from Samsung. I am very much happy with the purchase. Overall rating 5/5.

Everything is Good bt I think battery life is not as like as 6000 mah drained in one day even in normal use. Charging time is also very high. It takes Almost 4-5  hour for fully charge.camera is also average. Only Sound and picture quality is good

Edited after 3 months using
After recent updates battery drainage issue and slow charging eliminated. Now Almost 2 days battery backup in normal use and full charging in a hour. Camera performance is also improved.
Now it is a good mobile in this price range.

Overall performance of M30, with regard to the quality of display and battery life, is excellent. However following areas need improvement:
Sound quality for music, particularly for playing classical music, is disappointing, as compared to earlier devices (Nokia and Motorola) I was using
For watching video films, if I hold the device in my left hand,  often when my finger touches the volume / on-off buttons, the film stops abruptly and previous page appears - then I have to resume watching again. As a result most of the time (1 to 2 hrs) I need to hold the device in my right hand. I think the spacing of the top buttons need some adjustment.
An additional feature, to have a foldable stand on the back side, or at least provide a cover with such facility would greatly help watching films.
Initial photos with camera in auto mode did not meet my expectations - perhaps I have to study use of camera in more detail.
Otherwise, I would say M30 is the best smart phone in its range.

One of the best phones at this price.
Battery, camera, memory, storage, screen everything awesome.
Have cut 1 star as the headphones were missing. Don't know whether they provide it along with the handset or their warehouse guy has removed it. The pack looked intact upon delivery.

Samsung Delivers whats promised. Superb All in One i.e. Phone_Camera_NetDevice_Videoplayer and many more things.
M30s 6gb128mb is amazing and worth every single penny. Also thanks to Amazon for launching this device.
Battery Life is awesome..no worries for atleast 1.5 to 2 days.
Camera superb quality pics with auto assistance both Rear and Front amazing results with best picture quality.
Browing is simply wonderful.
Touch quality is better then any phones.
Looks are simply best. Just a proper back cover should had been provided. But this doesn't take away anything from phone.
Some improvement is required from finger touch sensor, as am sadly facing issue with inactiveness of touch sensor whereas same time my other phone touch does works, so issue with dirtiness issues with fingers.
Video Display, Browsing picture quality is simply wonderful with best battery, 6gb RAM, 128 gb storage, also Hiya caller ID is also bit helpful.

This phone or rather multitasking device is simply wonderful and worth more then the penny.

Screen is not white but its yellowish and the flash light is also yellow. I have to switch it off instead for taking shots at night. Otherwise the photo gets ruined. Rest other things like cameras, fingerprint scanner, processor, video playback etc. are better than other phones of the same range. Last but not least the battery is really good.

I bought this phone because Samsung has a research department. So they implement everything carefully.
After around 2 month usage, I have the following results.
Camera - Above average. Good camera quality in day light. Good shots can be taken at night using night mode. If there is no enough light, then significant amount of grains are visible in shots. Also grains are visible in wide angle video at night which is a demerit.
Battery - Better battery power. Longs about 1 and half day with social networking apps. Different power modes available helps to reduce battery draining. Completely satisfied.
Display - Display is great. Screen brightness get auto adjusted based on light condition. Screen get heated when using camera in hot climate conditions.
*Fingerprint sensor is slow sometimes but can be tolerated. Haven't  hanged till now. Overall not bad.

Honestly I am a samsung fan starting from my samsung galaxy star pro then Samsung galaxy j2 pro and now Samsung M30s. All its phone have superb quality.  Samsung M30s  is one of the best phone of samsung series. It has wonderful super amoled display,  awesome camera of 48megapixel,wonderful performance. Camera quality is awesome. It has the best clarity.Battery life is long lasting , it last for around 2days. But if more game is played then it lasts for atleast 1day ie 23-24hours not more than that.The fingerprint reader is also good but sometimes it's not fast as compared to others.

But there is one problem,when the phone usage is high it gets heated which is quite dissatisfying.

Rest everything is fine.

Screen Quality is awesome. Battery doesn't last very long, even though it is of 6k mAh.
Processor 9611 is equivalent to Snapdragon 665 processor. Dark mode works pretty well. Samsung is little slow in software updates, waiting for android 10 one ui 2.0 update. M31 comes with One Ui 2.0 based on android 10 by default. Photo quality is not bad.Low light photos are trash.Always on Display is very useful since no physical notification led is present.

Samsung Galaxy M30s disadvantages

Samsung Galaxy M30s has a bit heavyweight of 188 g (6.63 oz), It comes with a non-removable battery, It does not have Infrared or NFC feature, It does not have a water &amp; dust resistant, It does not contain Corning Gorilla Glass, It does not offer a Temperature sensor or a barometer.

Barring these the phone is just awesome

Overall good phone ,we ordered 6gb ,128gb ,but some technology or good Quality camera ,photo file size is not more than 2mb ,so may be this much GB are not required ,camera results  are v .good 👍, Weight is slightly more , would have better 5000Mah battery with less weight , alingment of 👂 ear to the earphone has to aquate to have a clear voice , samsang must look into this ,"may be in super AMOLED display things are like this only" . Now all other companies are providing headset and back cover ,same has not been provided by Samsang. CLEAR - 4.5

I wish if I would be able to rate this Samsung device, but I bought it for my Uncle. And that idiot person didn't even opened the package yet. I'm excited about the device specifications and the powerful battery and processor has provided by Samsung in it with a huge camera and all. And so as per the public reviews atleast I can say that, Samsung has done a pretty well job on this flagship device &amp; I hope this tech will prove it's worth on time. So thank you so much Amazon ... Always happy buying things from you 🙂👍🏼

Pros: sAMOLED display and battery are this phones' biggest usp. Display is awesome. Battery back up combined with fast charging is deadly combo.

Good camera for the price range, fiddled with pro settings to get some good pics.

Not a gamer, hence not able to comment on memory intensive performances.

Overall a pleasure to use and watch content.

Cons: yet to figure out  how to tackle the auto conversion of long SMS into MMS issue in native messenger app.learned it is common in some Samsung phone series.  It's annoying at present.

Glass is not gorilla. (Not a mention of the type used, anywhere) so have to go for a tempered glass additionally.

Speakers are a tad low on volume and fidelity.

It is very bad to know that the camera quality is not at all good even with 48 Mpa.
Now I'm feeling waste of money.
I thought Samsung brand is reliable but I feel they are fooling the customer.
I have ordered redmi note 7pro at the same time but cancelled later thinking that Samsung will be a brand one and reliable.
If I have the option to refund me I will opt for it immediately.

One of the best phones at this price range.
Pros:
1. Best battery life - 2 days with moderately high usage
2. Super AMOLED - reduces battery usage and excellent screen quality.

Cons:
1. Bloatwares - samsung is known for bloatware and we can see it repeat here.
2. Camera - Bloatwares are still manageable but the camera quality is utterly disappointing.
3. Slow FAST CHARGING - It supports a 15W fast charging but takes around 2-3 hours to refill the juice.

If you are like me who wants screen quality over camera quality and battery life over battery charging time then this one is for you!

Worth the cost. The best product since 4yrs. And after changing many brands i found this as best one.
Pros:
Best camera clarity.
Battery backup comes to 2 days with internet on and with browsing.
Smooth touch screen feature and its damn fast.
Handy mobile. Doesn't feel its too big.

Cons:
Update is limited on a longer run. Where mi gives updates for 2 versions of android. And no such good news in Samsung. Depends on your luck.

Nice phone and touch sensitivity, display and sound effects are awesome,  incredible battery life and speed of phone. It doesn't get heat while charging, well haven't charged 100% battery but can tell 60% charged remains more than 24 hrs with full internet operation.
Light weight and price very well.

Hats of Samsung India.

This product is one of the best buys for the range of 17000 to 14000 rs .
PROS
 It has a awesome display , the full hd + samoled display is one of the best displays in the price range of this category. The screen color adjustment done on it makes it better than other oled displays by comp-anies like realme oppo, vivo, redmi etc.
The 6000 mah battery powers the phone for 2 days on medium usage and sometimes even 3 days of light usage. I usually get screen time of 8 or 9 hours , while i upload lots of photos and videos on facebook  the battery has enough juice so that there is no need to turn of your mobile data

The rear cameras on the phone are good , it has one of the best looking wide angle shots but struggles during low lighting condition . The 48 mp camera has a separate mode to enhance detail which is not a gimmick  but actually there is more detail in the 48 mp mode.
The video stabilization is very good and the mike is also of good quality.The super slo mo is not as good as seen on the ads but is sufficient enough to do the job.
I like one UI it is much cleaner that other UI's like MIUI , Color OS, Fun touch , etc.
The exynos 9611 is a new chip set which ios efficient as well as powerful
There were no lags while playing PUBG at medium setting at high frame rate and COD at high Setting
There was minimum heating problems which is greatly appreciated.

CONS
The biometeric finger scanner is a little slow when compared to others phones but will do the job.
The speaker has good quality but is just averagely loud.
Some times the GPS signal gets disconnected but its just a minor inconvenience.
The auto brightness is a little slow but is accurate
 Even though fast charger is included it takes about 150 mins for full charge.

Pros -
1.BIG BATTERY and When i say big I really mean it
2. Fast charging
3.Nice camera Quality and Different Modes of use
4.Nice performance
5.Speaker is Really loud and Clear
6.isnt that heavy even though it contains 6000 mah battery!!
7.Display is OUT OF THIS WORLD if anybody want a good Display then GRAB THIS UP FAST it comes with SUPER AMOLED display !

Cons -,
1.Doesnt come with a Earphone . Not a con these days
2.As a said Better Display is present and Better Display needs better CARE ! Its delicate and Once broken Its costly to repair too !
3.Where ever u go people will Ask for your Phone And Will definitely fall in love with your phone ! And In my case they took it for Like 2 hours and filled it with RANDOM images ! 😅😅 Dont be serious this is not a CON
SO THESE ARE THE ONLY CONS I CAN THINK OF ! ;)
SO OVERALL BEST I REPEAT B-E-S-T phone in this price range
T-H-A-N-K Y-O-U 🤪 kindly upvote me !

It's been only a month since I brought this 6GB/128GB mobile. I brought this phone because it offered huge battery and I am satisfied with that part.
Pros.
Fingerprint sensor is good.
Camera is good. You can take great pics if you are good in photography.
Battery backup is great. I am charging 3 days once though watching a movie daily, early 4 hours music apps and other apps using internet.
User interface, ease of access is good.
Cons.
Heavy in your pocket due to huge battery.
Too many samsung and third party pre-installed apps. Some you can uninstall others you can disable.
Screenshots taken while watching videos in prime video are black though you can take unlike hotstar. I didn't get it even after trying many times. That's a bummer.

Honestly speaking, there is nothing I disliked about the incredible smartphone from Samsung launched recently, it is phenomenal in performance and enhanced my experience. The triple camera, videography (slow-mo, super slow-mo, hyperlapse); features have stunned me &amp; I'm fully surprised to get this medium budget high-end smartphone with robust performance. The extraordinary battery of 6000mAH is icing on the cake along with features like Full HD, dual SIM 4G smartphone with some cool pre-loaded factory apps are simply great. The speed of Samsung's own processor through tight integration with hardware, 6GB memory &amp; 128 GB storage are inevitably awesome as utility in this high data driven world and I'm feeling proud, confident &amp; elated by owning this phone,
 I'll strongly recommend everyone out on the street to go for Samsung Galaxy M30s without fail. This is definitely and inevitably better than all other brands in this category of specifications and beat others in all aspects. During this Diwali, this will go as Cracker Bomb to boost my swagger and make my Diwali more entertaining with family and friends.

Phone is great....no doubt ....value for money...the battery lasts for less than 24 hours for medium usage ...camera is ok ok...processor exynos is excellent ....can handle games like pubg without any lag.
The screen is just excellent....its really awesome.
Sound is also good but more on a treble side than bass....but in earphone Dolby atmos works great....and sounds excellent.
The best part about samsung is its customer service either via phone/chat or service center....you won't find any difficulties on this.
The software optimisation is the best in this phone...and you will feel like you are using a premium phone.
Cons :
1)minor software lag at the notch area...will be fixed in next update.
2) No Bixby
3) no secure folder
4) no knox protection
5) no samsung pay mini
6) slow security patch n software update

This are some basic features which samsung must have given and many can be given via software update.
Will update if find anything else soon.

This phone, Samsung Galaxy M30s is an overall great phone. The fingerprint sensor works 9 out of 10 times but the fact is that you have to cover the entire fingerprint sensor with your finger. The main camera which is 48 Mega-Pixel actually gives the quality of a 48 Mega-Pixel camera. The Ultrawide sensor is also good but when it comes to the depth sensor, it's kind of okayish. The battery life is good. The reason I have given 4 stars to the battery life is that it doesn't reach up to the expectations of a 6000-mah battery. Otherwise, the overall phone is great. One thing to be kept in mind is that this phone only works in India, China, and South Korea. So, if you are planning to use this phone in any country other than the ones mentioned, this phone would not work. I am moving to Canada in December and bought this phone so that I don't have to buy a new phone there but now I would have to buy a new phone there because this will not work in Canada. So, keep this thing in mind. Other than that, the phone is very good in each and every aspect whether it is gaming, camera, surfing or just texting to anyone.

Like
1. Display of the phone is excellent.
2. Battery is also v good as u can easily spend a whole day after charging it.
3. Nice fingerprint scanner.

Dislike
1. The processor of phone is not good as u compare it with snapdragon 675 or even 625 also.

2. The worst thing of this smartphone is the packing. As i opened the pkt there are so many dust particles on the display of phone.

Please don't buy samsung M30S
Battery draining very fast
Camera is not good as mentioned 48mp but picture quality looks like it's 8mp camera.
Heating up problem...other brand better than this I am really disappointed Samsung and Amazon policies are you can return or replace they have own app called blanco mobile diagnostic app itself very slow no use of that...I have wasted my money in this. Samsung brand but quality wise it's very poor..
As per my recommendation pls go with other brand..

I am writing this review after the phone usage of 4days. Blue model has stunning looks, very attractive. Phone performance is simply superb without any hanging/lagging issues. Display is very clear and touch is super responsive. Battery, you can call it as beast and giving minimum 2days of backup, excellent. If anybody is facing battery issue please try with the Stable mobile network with good internet signals in your area, because I tried initially with BSNL sim (Internet ignals are poor and fluctuating in my area) so battery has drained too quick from 88% to 20% on first day. Then I tried with another sim Jio network (which is having stable network and good internet signals) it's totally magic, how long you use it's giving minimum 2days of battery back up. Finally I can say it's a superb fantastic phone.

The best ever phone in this price range, I have ever purchased. Phone features are very smooth and seldom it creates any problem. 6GB RAM makes it work like high speed horse with smooth transition between different apps. 128GB ROM gives satisfaction that it doesn't run out of space. That, 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with a full-HD+ resolution makes display awsome. Camera Quality is Super with slow motion effects too. The panel is crisp with  good viewing angles and it is also legible when using it outdoors. The 6000 mah battery is long lasting making it dependable in times even when charging option is not available. I will give 5 stars to this model and I expect Samsung to bring innovative changes in the upgraded models with affordable price range to attract more consumers.

Its just a normal OK phone...could have got better options in this price range.

Important feature battery on which Samsung banks upon specifically in this model is below par considering 6k mAh. I am a normal user who doesnt plays any game on phone, use it mostly for whats app, FB, calling or some short videos but it barely last even for 18hrs.

Just an average phone strictly dont go for it you will for sure find better options.

Battery is a real monster .
You will get 2 days even if you use the net roughly.
Camera is average,not BEST.But you will get decent pictures.Front camera is of poor quality.
Super Amoled display suuuuuuper.
SOUND is DOLBY atmos.. NOTHING TO SAY..GREAT in earphone..
You will also get a light weight phone eventhough this device carries a MONSTER battery..
Always on display option is there ..
Fast charger will take 2.5 hours for full charge..They could have included a 20 W fast charger for this 6000 Mah battery..
I bought suphire blue variant of 6/128GB.
No earphone
No carry case in the pack.

Overall it's a nice phone for above average users..

Thanks

Writing this review after a week of using the M30s 6GB variant.
Display is perfect and a good job with resolution.

Performance is very impressive and I did not see any lag with multitasking so far.

Battery is monsters, a full charged battery lasts easily for 1.5 day with heavy usage and 2 days after moderate  use.

Body is of plastic material and a bit disappointing thing but it's doesn't have a cheap look and feel.

Face recognition is seamless in lights but sometimes it did not recognize in low lights, especially in dark. But this is with all smartphones, so comparably good.

Camera is very disappointing, I would say worse. Compared to vivo v11 pro which I was already using, Picture quality, depth, sharpness, picture details, in all aspect this phone has serious shortcomings and vivo did a great job with 12MP which 48MP of M30s couldn't. Selfi camera is also poor.

Overall if you are not a a camera person than at this budget it is a good buy.

Camera quality-4/5 good at daylight but not up to mark at night(1 point photos at night)
Battery-5/5 awesome battery back around one and half day of normal use still 30% remaining
Performance-5/5 after using one and half day.i write full review after check performance on heavy gaming like pubg but asphalt 9 work awesome no heating issue.
Screen-5/5 even more than 5 because of awesome screen quality at this price.
Value for money-5/5 yes definitely which phone give you super amoled display,6000 mah battery and good performance with excellent optimization by Samsung.(it cost me 11,600 during Amazon great Indian festival)

Most of people think about should I buy this product or not?
Person like me must
Who work all day not getting time for charging phone,
Who wants performance for daily use,
Who wants better screen for watching webseries,youtube,Amazon prime,Netflix etc.
Who wants good camera quality (not a photography person),
And who gaming sometime like pubg, asphalt.

Samsung Galaxy M30S Review:

Performance : Great. You can play games with high graphics but minor heating problem on backside during game play and charging.

Camera : Rear and front camera is good but not best. Needs to improve.
Specially low light condition it performs bad.

For photography I suggest to buy Realme XT or wait for Resmi Note 8 Pro for budget segment.

Screen : sAmoled display fHD+ is great to view videos, playing games and touch also best.

Battery : For my opinion battery backup is best. You can use it whole day in one charge with heavy usages.

It also support fast charge. Approximately 3 hours to take full charge.

Overall this device is good.

It has been a week I purchased the m30s and I am very happy with initial experience. Since last 10 yrs I was using only Motorola but my recent experience with Motorola made to shift to other brand. I chose Samsung being a most trusted brand in current market.  For me performance and battery is most important feature I was looking for as I do most of the official work from mobile. I can feel the difference after using M30s. Hoping the same performance for long run.

This thing is fast.........is very similar to Snapdragon 710 soc. no lags game run smooth on high grap and high frames.

6000 mah battery........gives me a full day battery where i watch amazon prime in hd 1080 and play pubg and cod mobile.

ONE UI is the best ui............. it's nicely made and optimised.

Build is also good base on the cost at which it comes........of some one feels its too thin apply a carbon fibre skin, that will do the job

front camera is so-so......not a fan of selfish selfie.Back camera is a bang.....best vibrant hdr images in daylight condition. struggles a bit in night.

screen is same as u get in s9, note 10 etc i.e flgship models of samsung mobiles its depth is good its a fhd+ samoled display.

WHAT ELSE U WANT...........nowdays reqlme phones are not good because of poorly optimised color os 6 and miui 10 that sometimes makes thing worst

It's a good, low range phone.
Pros - great display, great speaker, okay cameras, amazing battery life (as expected).
Having used the likes of s7 before, I missed Samsung's display and speaker quality. I wasn't disappointed there.
They say the best phone camera there can be is the one in your hand. Even though the cameras are average, with patience, good photography is possible. Use the Pro Mode, ditch the live focus, make use of it's 48 megapixels wisely. Be patient with the camera most of all.
I'm not a gamer, cannot vouch for it's gaming capabilities.
Cons - There are lags. Often while switching between apps, trying to access the keyboard, there are lags.
The My Galaxy app cannot be deleted. It keeps giving me notifications to install the Samsung widget, which looks cheap and ugly on the screen and I removed it the moment I saw it. Tip - disable this app and a few others to have a smoother, ad free experience.
That's about it.
It's a good budget phone.
3.5 stars out of 5.
Good value for money, with it's screen and battery.

I bought this mobile for battery life and I'm absolutely happy that this mobile could last more than a day beyond my extensive usage(6-8 hours of calls &amp; multiple business apps). Thanks a lot @Samasung for the battery beast.

I had Redmi A2 earlier, which use to last hardly a day with full charge. Comparatively screen quality is quite impressive than A2.

Its been a fortnight usage, Over all experience is 4.5/5 considering camera quality, processing speed and fingerprint reader. I haven't tested with fast charging but it takes 2 hrs to charge from 10 - 100% with box charger.

I would suggest to go with this if you are looking for battery life budget mobile with all required features like "fingerprint scanner, good battery life" etc.

Cons:
1.No NFC support so contactless transactions not possible. If you are serious about contactless payment just think.
2.No on screen fingerprint reader and in this budget segment with all features and back side reader, this is ok.
3. With given charger it takes time to charge mobile so we may need to buy a fast charger separately.
4. No ear phones in box, we have option to buy desired headset than getting a basic ear phones.

As like title "MONSTER"
impressed on
1-battery level - its so excited about backup power..Samsung done good one.

2-Fast charging - full charge with 2 hour and 20 minutes.. I think it's enough and good one because  guys it's 6000 :)

3- sAmoled display of 6.4 - no words.
Touch smoothness good..

4-Camera - 9/10 as like other phone not have special things.. but it is more..when think about the price..
Because of 4K &amp; inbuilt camera function.. also super steady also quite impressing feature

5-hang - so far no issue.. :)
Showing good performance..on 4GB RAM..Really very smooth to use
Doing good with One UI and exynos 9611

6- gaming - no issues so far I didn't feel  any issues in it..

Samsung can put atleast a screen guard or back cover on it :)

Simply as worthy its more... from Samsung.. also thanks to Amazon for fast delivery..

Highly recommended
Go monster...!!

Got the phone in one day. Seamless delivery by Amazon.
Unboxing:
The box had the phone, charger and the pin to unload the sim tray. Doesn't come with a back case or a screen guard. This is okay considering the price range.
Performance:
Quick charge is awesome as usual. Charged it for an hour to get 100%. Screen is super awesome. 411 PPI with Super Amoled. Not many phones come with this spec. It's a little heavy but it has a whomping 6000 mAH battery,which lasted for a solid 2.5 days with normal usage. Was really good for video viewing and the audio is decent as well. Haven't really tested the camera yet.
This phone is definitely better than the A50 as it has an Exynos 9611 processor.

Cons:
Nothing much as of now. A bit bulky I'd say. No screen guard and back cover. A bit lagging when gaming.

Overall a great phone from Samsung!

Mobile is classy and elegant with some awesome features in it.
Camera quality is superb.
I personaly feel samsung mobiles are sturdy.

But I do not know why samsung is not providing ear phones with this mobile
They should.

Otherwise the phone is good.
Lock screen changing wall paper feature is amazing giving it a fresh look everytime you open it

Best quality, you love its appearance and battery backup... require some improvements in next software update...area to be improved are camera, music apps,. Bcz there are some companies which offer tonnes of facilities in a range of 10 to 12 thousand...plz make available of accessories of samsung like genuine fast charger, Bluetooth headfone,  at low prices..dont expext price for your brand goodwill...or else people will shift to other brandsreat phone, with good battery back up...but samsung need to give upgradation in next software update launch,, they are..1.allow to take photoes by fingerprint sensor 2. Camera software is not upto the mark even though it has 48 mp camera 3. App lock software must be provided by manufacutrer itself bcz u cant trust softwares which is provided by others. 4.  Music player app must be provided in next update, bcz mobiles phones of 5000 rupees range contains all the above features

The new samsung m30s is a pretty good mid range  handset.The design looks  very premium with a good color  combination for the back.The 6.4 inch superamoled screen looks fantastic.The device  comes with a notch display.The processor exynos 9611 is a new addition to the exynos fam and gives a balanced  comb of power and performance.
The device runs on android  9 with Samsung  ui on the surface .The phone packs a triple  rear camera setup with a 48mp primary and 8 mp wide angle plus 5mp depth cameras.Front camera is also a very good 16mp camera.The phone has a fingerprint  scanner at the back and has face ai unlock feature  as well.The picture quality  of the camera is pretty  decent comparing to the price of the smartphone. Low light  photography is also well.Talking about the BIG 6000mah battery which  gives 20 -24 hrs backup continuously  is amazing. The charging time is also quite low as it has fast charging  tech .Overall if your budget is somewhere  around 15000 this phone is truly build for you .

Samsung galaxy M30s is a beautiful phone.  I purchased the colour pearl white,  and it's true to its name.  It has a beautiful super amoled display,  and yes super smooth touch screen.  The camera is fabulous with great selfies.  However, I am not very sure about its battery backup,  as the 6000mAh battery does get drained out quickly if you are only using with fast charging. With normal charging it lasted for about a day and a half, with an average mobile and internet usage. But I really really liked this handset

There is no point rating this mobile M30s below 3. I am using this mobile since October 3, 2019. It is indeed added with all necessary features which are very helpful in all ways. Cannot comment on the battery powered with 6000mah because it would be too early. Display is crystal clear. The phone is very handy to use. If feature like MHL &amp; NFC is added would be an extra advantage. Samsung should have add these feature too. But I somehow I feel these 2 features should be there on the phone. Apart from this it is excellent ph to use.

Indeed a Monster phone... my concern was that with such a huge battery, phone might be on a heavier side - which surprisingly it isn't.

Also, as with any new battery size for a budget phone, I was suspecting phone heating issue; which isn't the case at least on Day1.

Amazon delivery made this an even amazing buy.

i would like to raise a concern here from all those users who are using samsung M30s, are you really satisfied with the product, as i am facing below issues with the same, and i am the first time user of samsung. i expected much from the brand but it totally gets opposite.
1.overheating issues.
2.faster battery drainage as if we see 6000mah then it should give me the double backup which i was getting earlier with 3000mah.
3.Hang issues, late response on display whenever incoming call comes.
4. Speed of the wifi/mobile data is not visible.

M30s is a wonderful mobile. I am also using note 9 and wanted a second mobile to assist my day to day working like ms office functions  recording calls and meetings, video conferences, storing data, mapping, travel information  and many other activities for  which I wanted to spare my note9. I am glad to say that M30s has out performed in all my official activities apart from an emergency phone. I have found M30s equal in performance to my note9 in all included functions. Thank you Samsung for providing me additional assistance for negligible cost. In India we normally don't need NFC we use linked cards and UPI for payments/transfer of money, this is also not a drawback for me. Finger print reader, camera and battery are excellent.

This product is amazing.. i am using it from past 1 month and nothing has troubled me so far.. the camera quality is amazing, if you want to buy an expensive phone for camera then i would recommend you M30s this way you will save a lot of money, even i was clicking pictures at a party and there was a friend of mine who was also clicking pictures with his i phone and guess what. Samsung M30s night mode was the winner now that friend of mine is using M30s images captured by my phone for his insta, fb and whats app DP. funny but true.. battery is so amazing that sometimes you will forget that where you have kept your charger( not sure for the gamers as i am a normal user).

Specifications  and pros are already  given  by many others so lets just discuss cons that might affect you.

1. A very small charging  cable  I mean really  Samsung  that's  how you guys gonna earn profits  seriously  not  expected  this from you.

2. No protection  on screen  and no case provided  in the box which is quite common  these days.

3. Some pre installed  apps which you can't  uninstall.

4. No earphones  :p

Mobile really great performance , and looking very nice too more comfortable for holding excellent display all , I feel camera bit more lighting if you taken normal picture also it's looking like edited
Something like un realistic especially when you are taking selfie it's showing like more pretty and cute this other can easily say edited !!!!

Got this product replaced for first time due to issue in back panel (there was a noise when you tap it. Noise like something inside is not fitted properly and moving inside)
But after replacement also getting same issue. When I try to raise request to replace it getting issue like invalid number. Hence can't replace this current handset.
Only for this reason don't want rate it on higher side.
Also finger print scanner is not up to the mark. My earlier honor 7x finger print scanner way better than this phone. There are several fitures missing like apps lock, hide apps, etc.
Battery also last for a day or day and half with even normal usage.
I purchased this phone thinking on samsung as brand but really disappointed with the manufacturing quality of this product.

I have brought the opal black 6GB variant. Opal black looks great and premium which I will recommend among other colors.
I have used it for 2 days, so these are initial responses
Display quality is fantastic and is at par with flagship phones. Phone is very light and easy to carry.
Camera is good and wide angle covers well.need to try more pics to get to conclusion
 Video recording is stable and impressive
Battery rated capacity is 5830mah which is proving to be impressive. After charging full, it came for 28hrs
Samsung UI is as expected - Very clean and neat. Im not a big fan of MIUI.
Fingerprint is fast enough and face recognition is excellent
Games are running well. I haven't tried many hd games but for now it is performing well.
You can play prime video and Netflix in hd format which is main advantage over redmi note8
Overall, if you want a piece of mind and no nonsense phone, you will definitely satisfied with M30S.
I will update my review after using more.

The Finger Print Scanner is better than my previous A7.The Camera quality is Not up to the mark Though but Its does its job perfectly in this price range.The battery Back UP is up to the mark does not requires repeat charging during one day time which was the case with my A7.
The Gaming Performance is Good in 6GB variant but not very smooth as compared to Other high end Snapdragon phones.
But in This price range Both Camera &amp; Processor is Upto the mark.Call quality
bluetooth connectivity is also good

Nothing to say about anything good except the display.

Very bad build quality. The plastic back has some air pockets and it gives craking noise around the edges as well as on the back while holding the phone. You can't find such a cheap finish elsewhere.

Bad cellular reception and very small earpiece. 

Weak audio signal over the headphone jack and speaker quality is abysmal. Dolby over the headphone is just a software tweak. It doesn't do any good.   Hard to believe that it has a 6000 mah battery. Perhaps Samsung just named it regardless of the original capacity. 

Unless you experience this hands-on with some of the early victims' phones, please don't make the mistake that I had made by buying on the first sale.

just think twice before you buy this phone , which criteria is required for you in phone . for performance , camera this phone will not suit or match the money spent on this .

if u r redmi user you won't feel like using a phone which matches redmi, better with blind fold you can buy realme xt . bills quality is not good back Bukit in case is worst .

overall you can choose the company or brand which suits Ur need .

user interface is different , unwanted built in apps/ scrap. no notification light, no pocket mode . speakers are not good . no screen finger print . The features are very low compared to redmi . then  realme xt hits the row and we will get satisfied for the money spent on phone.

Well, I would say this phone is the best android phone I've ever used in this price range.
Let me give you my review.
Well, if you just search unboxing videos on YouTube, they all say the same thing that while they hold the mobile, it doesn't  give the premium feel but I would say all of them are wrong. The phone gives a rich feel(All of the colleagues at work are really fond of my phone because of that).
Second thing is about the battery life. Three words for it. "It doesn't end"🤣.actually being patient and completing the whole battery in a day is a challenge.
Camera is decent. Take good pictures. One of the best thing I found about the Samsung camera shots is that they look natural and not over saturated like other phones of its price range.
I've heard a lot that "Samsung Phones" in lower price range, always lag. Let me give you my review - "It doesn't". I've  been playing ping on high setting and it's smooth as cheese. Processor is really good.
So that's for it I Would give this mobile a rating of 10/10.

My Product have slightly defect at Finger print sensor, fingerprint sensor is working fine but it is slightly slope from right to left
I have requested a replace but Amazon inspection service say it is manufacturing defect and your phone is perfectly working

Samsung m30s is good, but build quality is very poor
It has very good display at this price range
Very good battery backup

I Hope Amazon resolve my problem

i was really excited tooo buy this phone  because of its amazing feature
but reality is something else
the basic function of sound is not proper
i thought there is some defect in this i will replace it and it will be fine
but when my phone replaced with another one the same problem happend
i am totally disappointed and disgusted
even the quality of its accessories is low
its battery backup and camera is amazing
but the basic think that is sound stops working and we have to reboot it
and it hangs same day of delivery
worst ever phone i guess so far

Looks good, sound nice,camera quality is nice
,Battery back up is awesome and battery charging is fast not as turbo chargers but fast no one can't face any trouble with battery but it's only issues is that it's working slow on first day of use it hanging on lots of area with out any  games installed in it only on just normal use like YouTube ,other browsing very dissatisfied from it's  processor speed
One star for looks,one for camera,one for battery back up and two star deducted for slow processing becoz what features we can use when it got hang.

I have been using it for a week.
Here is my review.
Pros

- Good looking phone.
- Great display.
- Battery is lasting for atleast 30 hours.
- Great performance.
- Video options seems to be great.

Cons
- it's samsung and at the very first  fall , even with protective cover it's going to break the screen. Be extra cautious.
- The camera quality doesn't seems to be what I expected from your ads.
- I still haven't figured out why the hell do one need this 48 mp, most of DSLR's are only 24 mp. Because we are not going to be printing big cutout images, a 16 mp lens with an aperture less that 2 would have been great.
If they were going to fit 3 camera lens, why not  three with different aperture ? Because that would have mattered in terms of image quality. 3 lens with f2.0 is only good for portraits , landscape images are horrible.

Apart from the camara , it is a great mobile.

 Design is just premium
 Wide-angle camera works well but clearly, it is not used in daily life but the triple rear camera looks quite decent.
 A headphone output is good..
The display is just awesome

Pathetic mobile do not buy it .
Camara quality  is not good , speaker does not respond  sometimes . More than all it doesn't  look like a Samsung  Mobile. My mi4 is way better  than this (excluding camara).
Poor quality  and looks like a China piece  except  screen nothing  is good.

Received the Mobile on 4th Nov,2019. Let's See Pros and Cons after the usage for One Month

Pros:
1. Battery - Battery Life is Awesome - Stays up  for one and half day based on the usage if u charge fully 100% in a single charge , but takes 2 hours to charge upto 100% from 0% - 5/5
2. Camera - Camera Quality is Awesome - 4.5/5 -Wide Angle is top notch for me.
3. Finger Print Sensor - Takes -0.3 - 0.4 secs to get unlocked using finger print sensor - 3.8/5
4. Display(Screen) - Since its a Super AMOLED Screen, its good one. - 4/5
5. Speaker- Sound quality is perfect. - 4/5

Cons:

1. Slippery - So my mobile has fallen down on the first day itself due to slippery of the back case and the screen (glass) is totally broken. Luckily my mobile is covered under ACKO MOBILE PROTECTION INSURANCE. Took four days to get the screen replaced. Be careful with the phone .

2. Back Cover - It Comes with Plastic back cover and its really very slippery and honestly should have to handle it carefully. { I recommend people to purchase the back cover case once u receive the product, for the safety}

3. Camera - 48MP - When i switch to 48MP mode, after clicking the picture it takes 3-6 seconds to save the picture because of the 48MP. But the clarity of the picture is better

4. Gaming - Since its Exynos Processor, the gaming like call of duty / pubg having more than 1GB of memory doesnt give the best quality and sometimes becomes slow.

Last but not least
THE BEST BUDGET PHONE FROM SAMSUNG AND I AM HAPPILY SATISFIED - 9/10

NOTE: PLEASE SELECT ACKO INSURANCE AS THEY COVER ALL THE DAMAGES INCLUDING LIQUID DAMAGE, SO THAT YOU CAN SAVE THE MONEY FROM INVESTING THE NON WARRANTY DAMAGES SAID BY SAMSUNG COMPANY.

THANK YOU :-)

The best phone you can get in this price range. If you want a fully packed featured mobile at low price. Then you are right place here. Withou any doubt must buy for it. I am very happy and thanks for Samaung to creating this mobile and selling for low best price. You can play games without any lag and you can watch videos on movies at full 1080p resolution. This is the best mobile that gives you amoled display.
The camera quality is so good that you will take photos without forgetting when you go to tourist places.
This is my honest review.

The phone is not like other Samsung .network is not full at anytime or anywhere. 6000mah battery is gives feedback like 4000mah.camera quality is not like 48 mp . Think before you buy because all the youtubers promote this phone like Salman's movie
-----
3.0 out of 5 stars
-----
Overall great phone for the price I paid (17k). 6000mah battery will last for 24 hours without slowing you down. The body is plastic compared to other expensive Samsung phones but at this price, I found it reasonable. 128GB storage will be ample. Camera quality is best compared to my previous phone (Lenovo K6 power). You get all the latest features like Face Recognition lock, fingerprint scanner, latest android. The processor and RAM are extremely powerful and will not slow you down. My usage is restricted to a few apps, WhatsApp, camera, emails and social media like twitter.

*know that it does not come with headphones.* You can check the box content in the description of the phone and headphones are not listed there. I didn't check that so when I opened the box and didn't find the headphones, I was disappointed. But later on, I found that's just how the way it is.

The only sad story was that an hour after I placed my order, Amazon introduced sale and they were giving 1k cashback in the form of amazon pay balance. I didn't receive it as the sale started at noon and my order was placed at 11:00. I spoke with Amazon and they refused to budge. If I would have placed the order after an hour, it would have been cheaper.

Otherwise delivery was prompt, packing was great and original and packaged arrived in a very good condition. It was brand new and sealed.

Quality of calling speaker is worst, audio has disturbance from the other end and volume is too low. I am really unhappy with product received and 2 day late delivery over the confirmed date during booking from Amazon. No benefit as prime member.
I need immediate attention to fix this ssue or replacement of the product asap.
😠😠😠☹☹☹

Though i have not used the phones camera much, but still i noticed that back rear camera is good, but what's disappointment is the battery life (so as they claim 6000 mah monster, but this phone is not that monster when it caomes to battery usage, battery of this phone drains as usual mobile phone that to with not using internet too much) and faast charging is just nothing, it takes atleast 2 hrs to charge it to 100% when plugged in with 20%.. so don't buy this phone on the basis of 6000 mah battery and fast charging, as this all is fake and doesn't exist. This is not an mosnter phone so be-aware..

Phone is heating up very quickly. Temperature goes to 35 to 36 quickly. And battery is lasting for 1 day and 3-4 hrs after moderate use of watching videos, listening to music, making calls, using WhatsApp and a few other apps. The advertised run time for this phone was 2 days.

The heating issue is enough to decide to not buy this phone as the 6000mah battery was a definte attraction when I bought the phone but the heating issue is linked to this battery. So hands down I would not recommend this phone until samsung fixes the heating issue with this model. I have got a replacement after reporting this issue but the new piece has more heating than the replaced phone.

Phone is getting very hot very quickly after talking for 15 to 20mins. you can't keep ear on the side of the earpiece. This is an issue as it becomes a day to day problem if the phone heats so quickly ,you have to use a wireless ear piece or so with this model given this issue.

Final opinion: don't buy until these issues are fixed.

Screen resolution very good. 5/5
Camera also good. Both front and rear. 5/5
Touch response also good. Screen touch as well finger touch sensors  response awesome.5/5
one of the best thing in this mobile is its battery...too good. Long life battery. Charging also fast. 5/5
Over all good phone.
I am writing  this review after using mobile for more than 3 days.
Must buy phone for this range compared to other brand like Mi or Realme,You will get Samsung like brand in this range.

Pros :
1. The amoled display is amazing.
2. Touch sensitivity is smooth and feels really nice scrolling through apps and settings.
3. Battery life is amazing. Gives two days of backup with normal usage.
4. Camera is quite good, especially the Wide Angle camera. Macro shots are beautiful. Selfie camera could have been a little better.
5. Super slo mo option is just awesome!
6. Samsung's One OS is super smooth and much better than Oppo's ColorOS. It is, to some extent better than MIUI as well, in my opinion. There are lots of options for customisation.
7. Sound quality of the speaker is decent, it's loud enough to enjoy music, voice. Dolby Atmos for headphones is also enjoyable.
8. Network reception is praise worthy.

Cons :
1. Build quality is the biggest flaw of this phone. Some parts like the power button, feel flimsy. Tempered glass and a strong back cover are mandatory.
2. Camera is not up to the mark for night photography. Shots are quite noisy.
3. 16 MP front camera could have been better.
4. There are some lags while gaming.
5. 15 watt fast charger is not fast enough for the 6000 mAh battery.18 or 20 watt fast charger should have been provided with.

Conclusion : I am content with my buy. The overall usage feels awesome because the interaction of the user with the phone is something that Samsung knows well. I am happy with this phone.

So this phone is abolutly awesome.. I am a heavy user and I get about 8 to 9 hrs of screen time which is a lot or in other words it lasts me full day on heavy usage for regular usage it will last almost 2 days. And the camera has been improved from m30, nice and clear images. And the video is the highlight has added slow motion and image staballization which is great in this price segment. And display is love the samoled is amazing with pure blacks and all... So overall this is an amazing phone and worth buying plus it's getting Android 10 this Jan or Feb

So, i bought this phone after reading and watching many reviews on numerous websites and YouTube.
Overall phone is pretty smooth, no lag good performance. You can play pubg and it will run okayishly till medium graphic settings and then it's bound to lag.
Talking about the camera, low light and performance in artifical lighting in not as good as i expected, you lose a lot of details.
The major concern that i have with this phone that in pro camera mode there is no way to control the shutter speed and you can only increase the iso to the value of 800 and you cant even adjust the focus of the camera through stock camera app but you can use the open camera app to adjust focus manually after enabling the camera2api in open camera's setting.
Rest all is good, display is super amoled which is great and the. Battery runs for about 1 and a half day almosi giving SCREEN ON TIME OF ABOUT 10 HOURS.

The fingerprint sensor is amazing and there is almost no time gap when I put my finger for unlocking. It unlocks automatically without any hang. The camera quality is absolutely good. I loved the camera most. The photos taken through this camera are of high quality and very good. The battery life is also good. After charging on first day, the next day the charge didn't even gone down below 60%. I liked the color also.

Overall  I would rate 4.8 out of 5 because the thing which I didn't like was in built apps like Netflix which I could not uninstall. I also didn't like is not got headphones within the box. You should have given at least a headphone with the set.

But if anyone asks me about recommendation I will recommend him/her this phone.

I've been using the phone for a few days now, upgraded from One plus 2 due to budget constraints. However, I did not expect much from this phone. But I would honestly like to say that I am very satisfied with the product as it offers features like the other phones in the higher price range.

Pros:

1) The battery is a stand out component as it easily helps you with being outdoors without worry. Just one charge can get you through one and a half-day of heavy usage.
2) The features almost look like the same on the higher flagships from Samsung.
3) The storage is great as well 128 GB + 512 extendable is sufficient I guess.
4) The brand value stands a chance to sell the phone within a year with a good return with the Exchange option on Amazon itself which you will not get through direct vendors.
5) The finger print reader works great as well.

Con's:

1) The phone does not feature notification lights, so you will have to count on vibration or the notification sound.
2) The screen is not that great with regards to the other phones in this price range, but it is okay to compensate for the other features that the phone has. The darks don't really stand out, Its just like a normal 1080p screen.
3) The camera as well only performs fair enough only in the day time not that great in the dark.
4) Slightly bulky so ya it justifiable for the config provided. Not that big of a con.

Overall, great price for a year use and value for the config provided. I am satisfied thank you #Samsung #Amazon. Great work!

Plus don't buy this phone.
Inspite of reading review of heating issue I bought it. Just using for 5 min it starts to heat. I am not able to talk over phone normally...I hv to use headphones or speaker mode as mobile starts to heat even in normal calling of 1 minute.
After giving request of replace in amazone ..these people are saying it is normal upto 48 degree. Human body skin temp normally is around 36. If I touch such heated phone to ear definitely will get burn and over the time some other thing in brain....
Helpless now
Amazone not accepting it

This is a sell In the name of brand image what both amazon and Samsung has established.
It seems like product has not gone through quality tests and lunched hastily due to festive season.
My honest opinion:

Pros:
1.Good Battery(Camera consume battery very fast) for moderate use
2.Few UI feature given to keep Apps away from running in background(I felt it better than Google Android-one UI on this specific aspect). It may help in preventing wastage of charge.
3.Always on display and few gesture controls make it user friendly.
4.Has good Screen brightness,can be readable at outdoor condition.

Cons:
1.Camera is a gimmick,It will shoot good pics if shots are taken within approx 5 meter radius,object shot is large,objects well exposed to light and camera is kept as much as along direction of light source .Colors do not seem natural, pics contain too much noise and ,very bad edge detection.I have attached 15 MB pic shot 48 MP camera on this phone and 5 Mb shot pic shot by a 12 MP camera of Mi A1.Viewers can distinguish the quality themselves.The one shot in Mi was shot against light source,still it detects good edges and color seems to be natural.With 100% zoom you can still identify the object and edges.The one shot in M30S although shot along source of light, the edges see much distortion by just zooming it 10%. With more zoom you can not identify what the object was.
Videos shot even with 4k contains good amount of noise.Colors seem to be super saturated both in pics and videos,pics shot are much darker than natural.Night mode photography contains immense amount of noise.It only magnifies the brightness wherever color is detected,it distorts the edges badly and you will find noises like dust storm.
One weird feature I observed is that when you try to shoot pic, the handset makes the pic seem 4 times more distant than actual contrary to the pic what it promotes for hot air balloon or the ladakh pic on Amazon site.
2.Audio is not up-to the mark.With Dolby Atmos, UHS and equalizer on, it seems voice loses around 20% clarity.It is not loud either.Voice output is not loud even in headphone and the lows and highs are less clear even with good standard headphone.It seems voice is always supressed under instrument or sorrounding sounds.
3.Screen Width to length ratio is such that many videos do not fit to screen.Even if Zoom option is available, making the video full screen makes it lose contents around edge
4.Videos played on streaming app on phone clearly seems to loose color reproduction.Videos loose sharpness exponentially with increase in movement or motion within videos.It seems to be issue with the processor.Even video casted to TV see this effect and video played from within internet tv has better color reproduction.
5.Adapter takes more than 3.5 hours to fully charge the phone while it is on and around 2.5 hours if it is switched off.
6.Out of given 4 GB RAM,512 MB reserved for unknown purpose, Apps take 1.8 GB even if all put to sleep, hence around 1.5 GB of RAM available for use.
7.Poly carbonate case does not feel sturdy and it seems there is some gap between case and core phone around sim ejector.It seems prone to water seepage even in light drizzle.
8.Due to lesser screen width it will take more of your effort for typing accurately in portrait mode,the reason being keyboard key of less width.In landscape mode keyboard fills 75% of screen,it leaves you to type without watching the content output on screen.I noticed some word suggestion not of English type while typing in English.Ex: It was suggesting knoledge for Knowledge.
9.There are security risks I observed, I noticed many new apps in my app screen although I never set permission to any app to install other third party apps.I personally do not feel safe for banking activities.

I have noticed all these flaws even if I was using basic handset like Mi A1 for last two years.Except for battery, Mi A1 handset was  superior then this M30S.Any person who is not biased for a particular brand handset can clearly identify the quality. I would be very happy to return this handset and get my Old Mi A1 back if Amazon could allow so.

I could not understand why it tags itself "Made for India". This phrase seems to be a misnomer,Indians have evolved and have good eye to distinguish compromised and good quality product.Will never rely anymore on  promotion done by Amazon and Samsung and paid reviewers who never tell actual issues in a product.

An AMOLED screen which is truly stolen from the costlier Flagships... A beefy 6000mah battery which lasts through my day... A decent RAM spec coupled with good processing power from Exonys processor... M30s tames PubG with ease. What more do you need???

I have been using this phone for 20 days now... Simply a excellent value add for the price you pay.

I ordered this phone on 16th October, next day I received the phone.

I purchased this phone because of its nonster battery. Its 11 days of using this phone and its battery  is amazing. Easy last 2 days after full charge.

Carema quality is very good but little lag in focus, maybe it will be fixed by software update in the future.

Design is also good.

Harware capabilities are good to play heavy game with no lag.

Display quality is superb with super amoled display.

Overall I love this phone, if you are looking for a device which battery life can last long this this is the best phone for you.

Amazing Phone.
First I thought of buying redmi note 7 pro. Then with a little research realms 5 pro was on my mind. But at the last moment samsung , amazon , sbi discount was such a surprise that I changed my mind the last day i.e. the day  sale went live for prime users.
Battery : Truely a monster.
Speakers : No issues with the loudness.
Camera : Good at the price.
Display : Too good.

First of all Amazon Delivery is very fast. I ordered on Saturday &amp; got on Monday itself.
Got 10% discount with SBI card, Rs 1,000/- cash back in amazon pay &amp; Acko 1 Year Screen Protection Plan.

Pros -
Superior Photos &amp; Video Quality (Live Focus, Night Mode, Wide angle, Slow Motion are awesome). Camera doesn't pop out of the back panel, So its easy to keep your phone on a plane surface.
Processing speed, Sensors  are very fast
Great Screen Display I ever seen
No heating No Laging
Fast charging provides quick charging
Sound is loud and clear enough
The Mobile comes with various good features

Cons -
Body material is not good quality
Battery does't seems to be 6000 mAh
Doesn't have inbuilt App Lock, Remote &amp; QR Code Scanner Apps
Doesn't have screenshot &amp; Lock Button in Notification

Overall Value for Money

I think M30s is an exceptional device and its performance (last2 days) was too good

Starting with main highlight its a boon for people who need good battery backup, this phone once charged upto 80% in 1 hour (with included samsung adaptive fast charger in box) keeps on going for around 18-19 hours with LTE data on always Thanks to 6000mah battery.

The 48MP camera is also too good at first look and I clicked a few pictures also( room lightning and outdoor), you can see them above.

I chose Pearl White color, my friend bought the black color option, which depends on personal choice but I liked the Pearl White.

I like the overall design of this phone just the water drop selfie camera is annoying to me personally, I hope samsung will bring something more innovative design in the future.

I also tested the fingerprint and face unlock feature and found fingerprint was quiet more responsive than other phones in this range and its almost same as in an iPhone 7 plus or one plus 7, which are almost double its price but I found a bit lag in the face unlock feature when I tried it the my beard open and tied it took few tries to understand its me.

The best thing is battery.
One simply can't crain the battery in 1 day,no matter how its used.
Super bomb battery.
Rest evey thing is above the avg. And i can say best in this price range.
Camara quality must be improved.
Some times there is poor network reception. (I have tried it with same network operator at same place)
So just improve on network reception and CAMARA..

Samsung Galaxy m30s, worked fine for 4 days.
After 4 days of use, suddenly Screen Touch Function stopped working completly. Nothing works in the screen. Not able to use the phone even to attend a call. Disappointed due to the POOR performance. Contacted Amazon for Refund, they told me to Restart &amp; Reset the phone, using power button and volume button. But the phone is not restarting even after pressing Power button for a long time.
Trusted Samsung seeing all positive reviews...plz dont buy samsung mobiles....Total waste of money and time.

Samsung M30S is awesome  phone  with beast battery.....the battery easily comes for two to three days usage on single charge...

The OS is very optimised towards day to day activities and battery consumption...

Regular update of software is an additonal  advantage and keeps all software bugs aside...

Another big thing I like the display....its very bright and crispy...viewing videos is just a beauty ...

I recommend this mobile to everyone who is not interested to charge mobile phones daily and display lovers.

A good and powerful  mobile in the best budget..

Thanks for viewing my feedback

I must say - Anyone can go this device based on requirement pick 4/6 GB RAM 64/128.

SUGGESTIONS FOR SAMSUNG
1. Is it not possible to give Screen Guard &amp; Back Cover along with device taking few extra amount Because it is quite difficult to get it from Market specially when product is newly launched.
2. Think about device back side comfortness in next model. It is too sleepy- Grip concern!!

I am not a samsung fan, but the specs and user reviews made me buy this mobile.
Camera is a flop. Very bad quality.
Mobile is very slow. When I started downloading it went on for hours to download. My internet speed was good though.
I have used realme earlier and thumbs up to realme.
Also I have read something like this mobile is for Indian sims. Not aware of this feature.
Not very much impressed. 😐

Battery has a issue,it performs very well in case of heavy task and drains a little,but in case of light apps also it drains like heavy apps.For example it drained 10% in 2.5 hours of music playing but in case of pubg it drains about 7-8% in an hour.Thats ridiculous.
Again the ui feels so laggy.
Exynos 9611 is comparable to snapdragon 675 but does not seem to give smooth experience,switching  between  apps is so laggy.
Front camera quality is avarge.
Back camera is superb.
One more problem that I have noticed is that CPU temperature goes as high as 50 degree celcius during normal tasks while battery temperature is at 30.
It is a featuristic phone with loads of feature.One ui is great.
This phone also has a little  network issue but not of much concern.

Excellent mobile. But like mobiles of other companies it's length (height) is not comfortable for them who wishes pocket size mobile, it should be short. The length and breadth should be to pocket size with large battery and full screen with good quality performance. Signal reception is so-so. Camera, battery, finishing and performance is excellent.

This is my second Samsung phone after a long time. I purchased it in the first sale during the Great Indian Festival in October, and been using since then. I am dividing this review into two parts, describing the pros and cons of this product.
Pros:
1. This phone has a stuuning FHD+ sAMOLED display and that is the best display you can buy in this price range. Colours can be tweakedz as there are two modes in the settings for this. Blacks are deep and the colours are vivid, viewing movies and tv shows are a delight on this display. Also, it supports Widevine L1 for streaming HD content.

2. Processor: The processor is average, the benchmark scores are lower than other phones in similar price ranges, but I don't think it matters much to a normal user. Performance is smooth in day to day tasks. As I don't play games on my mobile, I can't comment on its gaming performance.

3.UI: Samsung's One UI is good and also feature rich, and doesn't feel too cluttered like vivo/oppo/huawei/xiaomi ui. It resembles stock Android, but has some little features that comes in handy at times. The UI feels smooth and the animations are smooth. There is also a dark mode which looks great on the amoled display.

3.Camera: It features the ISOCELL Bright GM2 sensor which can take good looking photos at well-lit and averagely lit conditions. If the scene optimiser is on, the photos are a little bit oversaturated, but it looks good. The wide angle lens is really wide and takes great wide angle photos with great dynamic range. The depth sensor is an RGB sensor, but it is only accessible through the live focus mode and the subject has to be really close to get that depth effect. The 48MP shots are good, but sized too big to be used somewhere. The camera performance is a mixed bag in my opinion, it can be great at times and average at some times.

4.Battery: The battery is huge and lasts for almost 2 days with moderate usage. For a heavy user, it will last around one and a half day. It charges through the 15w charger supplied with the phone, and it takes almost 2-2.5 hr to charge it fully. The battery performance varies with the software updates provided (I don't know if it happens with me only) the last update giving a stable performance.

Cons:
1.Sensors: The sensors work weird on these one. The gps sometimes is highly off and shows wrong routes and directions with Google Maps. That is a big issue when you are at a unknown place and you use Maps, or you are a frequent app cab user. The fingerprint sensor is slow, failing to unlock the phone at multiple occasions. It also doesn't have a ambient light sensor, it uses the front camera to sense the light; and this approach is a little but aggressive as well as battery consuming. The auto brightness sometimes increases or decreases the brightness so much, that it sometimes need manual readjusting to set it to our need.

2.Build: It is made of plastic and the in-hand feel is not so great. The plastic is soft and scratches easily, and at different places it squeks. It feels like that if I am holding a cheap toy. The front is made of glass, but no glass protection is mentioned anywhere.

3. Front Camera: It has a 16mp Fixed focus front cam, which produces soft images in bright and averagely lit conditions.It is average for selfies and that's it.

So, to draw a conclusion, if you need a phone for great display, great battery and average performance with the Samsung branding, buy this one. Else buy the Redmi note 8 or the Realme XT which have some advantages in some departments over this phone.
Thanks for reading!

After using product for 12 days I have noticed that these M series devices by Samsung are designed specially for Indians as M30s consists 6000 mAh battery which is quite amazing in mid segment phone's with triple camera for photo geeks . 1 full charge can easily take you upto 40 to 45 hours if you are not a frequent user . I am charging once in a 3 days . Thank you samsung great work done . Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as shown and mentioned in add , product I received was very well placed , thank you CLOUDTAIL

Great buy for the price. The performance is comparable to flagships with fluidic performance in day to day use. Features like 6000mah battery,  SAMOLED notch display and Triple camera setup makes it stand apart from competition.  The device has fast charging support and the battery lasts more than 2 days with normal use. The picture quality on all the cameras is very good and the crisp display makes the colors pop out. On normal to moderate use, no signs of heating were observed.

"Battery Life" is the main feature which attracted me towards this 6000 mah giant. I can use it extensively without worry for my full day on single charge.
"Fast Changing" is the most complimentary feature for a big battery phone. There is no use of a big battery if you need almost the same time for charging it as for the Tim's you used it. Really fast charging with type C port fast charger.
Big screen, triple camera, RAM  are the best features in this segment with a budget of Rs 16999. Smart choice for Smart people.

Excellent battery backup. Fully charged with in 3 hours. 2 days with data on consume only 90 percent of battery. Excellent camera quality even in night mode for still and video.
I will give 5 out of 5 points. Better than all smart phones at such mid range. Get 1000 cash back with 6 nocost emi. Delivered with in 2 days superfast delivery service. Its same like samsung galaxy A50s except only front camera of 16 mega pixel. Value for money..

I don't review. But this time i thought i should give a review.
This phone is an example of numerous cheap quality things.
-built quality is just pathetic. Even side panel/housing was not properly finiahed. It has rough surfaces and was aiming out just with nail.
-Front Camera is this poor that you will not found in a 5k phone. pictures lacks sharpness and details.
-Even packing box Adapter, and sync cable will make you feel that you have been cheated.
-Rear camera is just okay. Don't execept anything extraordinary.
Only good thing is one UI that's it.

This is my thoughts about Samsung m30s after using it for a month. Till now I got 2 or 3 s/w updates one among them is for security patch.

Finger print scanner, neither quick nor too slow, it takes around half a second to unlock.

Camara, not a cup of my tea. Because I like have more detail on the images and as natural as possible. I always like to zoom in and see how much detailed is the image.
But with 12mp shots the images comes out quite well but when I zoom in there is no detail and also looks like a water painting. The 48mp shots quite good comparatively, but still it doesn't meet my expectations of 48mp, it's more or less like my Nokia 6.1 plus's 16mp images. I also agree I didn't play around much with 48mp shots. Average in low/indoor light, Night mode is good and it gets the job done. Front camera, there is not enough details and also softens the faces.
Remember I'm not telling the taken images are bad or unusable, they are just weaker on the details. Actually if you don't zoom in beyond 50% you will not feel much issue with the details.
Overall the camera is little about the average fot still photos if you are a person who looks for more detail. But if you are someone who doesn't care much about the details, then the images taken are very good, the dynamic range is nice. Hoping Samsung will improve the camera performance through updates.
The videos are really great. The super slowmo is awesome.

Display is super good.

Battery life, is simply great, for last 3 to 4 weeks I used the phone heavily and it coverd my day.

Performance, though I used phone heavily last month, remember I am not a heavy gamer. For day to day usage the phone is great very less lagging issues (mostly when switching between the apps, I think that was UI issue, may be I am wrong.) And, never seen any heating issues till date.

The speaker output is not so loud, and if I reduce the volume below 50 60 percent, then the output sound felt even lesser.

The ear piece is very good and so loud.
Cellular call quality is great.

4.finger print and face detection sensor  also very good and faster

Battery : No doubt this mobile is a battery beast, it gives around 8+ hours of on screen time but the charging time is 2.5hrs plus whereas other mobile take less then 1.5hrs

Camera: vo pared it to one plus 7 at low light outdoor photography, for low light it is better then one plus 7, but i find indoor photographs pixelated when zooming in. At day time photographs at quite good.

Display: display is superb, compared it to one plus 7, you won't find any difference in color or quality.

Ui: ui is neat and clean

Overall you can go for it at this price point.

M30s is just a phone , It's a package of your daily life.
I will give you every detail about the feature just hold on☺.

Pro__

DISPLAY --💓💓- There is no comparison with other phones , it's far ahead. (5/5)
BATTERY --Brilliant optimisation, it will give you 2 days of battery in continous use. (Heavy Use).
Processer--Great development over 9610,before buying this phone I was little confused n I thought it would be similar to 9610 but believe me it's more than than.(Exy_9611).
RAM- Brilliant RAM management.
CAMERA--Bhai Super steady mode , S slow motion.
EIS--GREAT
Everything has some cons n yes it is also
Cons__

Camera detail comparing to the phone with same price I found little disappointment over it detailing to every colour and blur effect (That's Negligible as Branding matters a lot )
Polycarbonate body -- Look wise need to compromise.

Overall it's value for Money.

The battery is really a monster one that lasts vary long. The camera quality is very high and this is the best camera that I have ever used in a phone that gives a professional camera clarity. The super slo-mo video is high impressive and the super steady motion is undefinable. Unlocking becomes very easier and faster through fingerprint and face unlocks that opens the phone with less than two seconds. The speed and accuracy of this is very high and it does not even lag while playing high graphics games. This phone is the best I had used ever.

I swtiched to this phone because of the following reasons
1. The SuperAMLOED Screen, because I like to read on the go and stream movies and TV shows as well. I couldn't ask for more.

2. The brand Samsung, the name itself has a sense of surety in it.

3. The triple camera setup, which has the best segment range wise camera.

4. Battery, I use extensively and the back up of juice is not enough for me. I know the irony but 6000 mAh is not enough for me

5. For Rs.13990. You can't get a better deal from a brand like Samsung.

6. Best phone for all the people who hate Chinese products.

Pros.
1. Battery beast, can play High end games atlest for 8hrs continuously
2. Wide angle camera produces good quality long shots.
3. UI is buttery smooth. Thanks to one UI.
4. Doesn't weigh much and feels good to hold.
5. Display is very bright and produces realistic output.
6. Video image stabilization is great for shooting while riding.

Cons.
1. Camera quality can be improved (not a problem since it is expected at this price point)
2. Sound output through speakers are not loud enough.

At this price point, M30s is a bang for bucks and a steal deal.

Good job Samsung to win the battle against mi-me.

Battery best in Samsung.
Camera far better than Redmi, as always samsung camera is best.
Screen is bright and night mode available which thorws an epic display experience. Type C charge is really fast.
Finger print is slow. In pro mode, camera snapping takes time, a few seconds to capture a shot.
Touch feeling is very smooth.
UI is complicated to find out anything in settings. If you use flipcover, then screen does not glows back after your call end, when you want to see immediately by opening the flap if the call is disconnected or not. You have to double tap in screen to illuminate the screen after your call end. Over all hardware is best but needs software improvement. No force advertisement.  My experience is good in terms of personal data security after using back to back two redmi phone. No force sync to cloud server as MI is forcing every user.
Samsung introduced a new HEIC format in this phone which is not supported in any social media and other's phone. So you can only see your images in your phone only, if you capture photos in this format. Their is no app available in this mobile to convert and share this type of pics to others or  upload. But this type photos saves memory a lot with full details (HD like).
You have to pay for downloading any fonts/much more in samsung phone like apple phones.
No screen guard, backcover and headphone available with this phone's box.
Overall my using experience is better than using a redmi phone. I am a very tech savvy person.

It has got a ton of power through its 6000 mah battery. Huge!!!! For my moderate usage, this easily comes for 3 days- My usage is typically of 4-5 hrs of calls, 4-5 hrs of activities and 2 movies on prime and other run of the mill items. Decent phone and mine is 6 /128 GB model. Great display and not so heavy model....
Just to add a word of caution: Either The recent update of security or Samsung health update is draining the battery and please be aware of this while buying... Both updates happened on 18/11/2019.

1. I'm a prime member and ordered Mobile on 28 th sep with same day delivery to gift it but received a defective mobile.
2. Apps are getting closed as soon as I open them. (Like Message app, Facebook etc).
3. It is asking for a software update but when try to update it is not getting updated and showing an error message.
4. I requested for mobile replacement but the response from Amazon customer service representative was very poor and very rude.
5. Highly disappointed with this Samsung product and Amazon service.

Hello Everyone...
I have been using Samsung  Galaxy M30S from last 1month+, I have used the phone maximum &amp; iam here to give my review.

Firstly I thought that only Battery will solve my problem, because i was fed up with my  last mobile. While I was looking to buy best phone I have done research on many mobile for around 3-4months, but all I have seen doesn't impress me through its features...

In Nov 1st wk I have seen add in online about M30S, it just grabbed my attention &amp; just I made research on Samsung Galaxy M30S for 1day.. next day I have ordered it.

Below is my experience as of now.

### Pros..👍👍👍
+ 🔋Big Battery - it's just a killer one👌.

+ No Lagging during big games like Pubg(I have played for more than 4hours) &amp; still playing for 3-4hrs daily.

+ I used to attend calls &amp; make calls for min 120min in a day -- still battery is not heating..

+ Finger print sensor is fast.

+ After all of my daily usage.. in the evening I will be having 45%+ charging left..

+ For Full charging  iam getting for 1full day+ usage (Approximate usage:::::  including 2hrs phone calls, 2hrs music, 2hrs YouTube, 3hrs pubg, 2hrs net surfing,  + other usages)...

### Cons...👎👎👎
- Camera clarity missing when we zoom @48mp, need improvement.

- Selfie zoom-in or zoom-out missing, much needed one.

- Finger print sensor &amp; base are almost flat.. unable to touch at right place/point, but after using backcase it is good

But finally....
Iam happy with this Mobile..
SAMSUNG GALAXY M30S😁

As other reviews suggests, best phone to you can buy that is reliable and trustworthy unlike other cheap brands.
I will give 3 out of 5 for camera quality. 16 mp of my previous moto gave better shots than this. However, I got more features than that. Low light photography is very bad.
However, you will get good selfies.
The wide angle camera is seriously a bluff.
You don't get a manual focus adjust in pro mode.
Video stabilizer is great.
Battery life is just awesome.
UI is too good.
Popup and multiview of apps is extra feature you will love.
Works smooth.
Playing COD for couple of months, works fine with no lags.
Minimum of heating is there.

M30s is a killer buy for those who actually use the phone for making calls, watching movies/videos, and day today work like using bank apps, chatting, emails, online shopping etc. No issues in procrssing speed.perfect phone with superb battery backup.
The fingerprint scanner is quick and gives no lag.
Not meant for people who are expecting great camera quality,although its an ok camera.

One request to samsung...why didnt you give heptic feedback for the keyboard.

It's a fantastic phone. Battery life is immense even after severe gameplay. Lasts more than 24hours. Other aspects like Display, Fingerprint, Camera are all excellent. Photo quality is also super. And it's a very fast phone, courtesy the 6GB ram. Been using it for 2months and I'm very happy with the product. I would like to give it more than 5 stars if that was possible.

Product fells like we are using cheap brand product. Plastic material used in this phone is very cheap and even you can fell some gap on both side if you press the phone with some force.totally unsatisfied, I bought this product with very high expectations but fell cheated, I move to Samsung after 4 years as I don't want to use Chinese product but must say Chinese brands are doing much better and releasing good product with aggressive price. Sumsung should learn from chinese brand how to win customer faith.

*Mobile look/built quality - decent (not much good, not much bad)..
*Battery Life - Best no one can beat this mobile in terms of battery..
*Ram Management- Good..
*System UI - One Ui runs on android 9 pie
*Camera - decent..(don't expect it as dslr)
*Display Quality - Awesome (literally no one can beat this in display quality)..
*Fingerprint/FaceLock - descent..
*sound quality - Good..
At last but not the least
I would reccomend you

Battery : Powerfull battery. I am able to use for 2 days with normal usage along with internet. Took 1/2 hour to fully charge from 5%

Display: I dont like thier display and their response. It bit laggy comparing to peers its not at all up to the mark

Finger print sensor: so lagging performance. even cheapest  (in regards of price)  MI phone has good sensor

Camera: Not all satisfied with Camera. Just for name shake it triple camera. No detialing in picture. When we zoom the pics taken bu this phone, it has lot of blurry pixels. NOT GOOD

When you buy this phone dont forget to buy case for it. Display is so fragile if you drop from your hands while you are sitting in floor it get damages

Performance: very lagging performance

overall if you need a phone with good battery backup you can go for it else I dont suggest to but this mobile

User review ...not an expert or geek.
Camera -Selfi camera is not that good..front camera with multiple options is worth buying this ..
Battery - takes time to charge and good news is takes btime to drain.
Interface - smooth...no lag at all..
Very light to handle...
Apps are smoother than ever..
How can I forget about music...in built Dolby is crazy...ears go wow with my Sony earphones..
WiFi connectivity, Hotspot,Bluetooth is easy to operate..
Gaming is smooth..
Best thing I can say is that dual sim plus memory card support..hybrid sim sucks..
With this 6gb ram and 128gb internal memory with expandable upto 512,eliminates  space issue out of box...
My suggestion, overall purchase it..
And thanks Amazon for such a steal price
Thank u...

Needed to buy a phone for a very long time and then I came across the Samsung m30s during the Amazon Great Indian Sale. Coming from Samsung I didn't expect the prices to be what they are so it really was a no brainer for me to go for it considering the features it offered and the brand name.

Pros:
Awesome back camera
Battery backup is MAD 😍
Super AMOLED screen is beautiful

Cons:
Size of the screen could've been smaller. I have big hands but to touch into corners it needs both
The front camera gives you soft pictures and beautifies you automatically. No way to put that off.
Personally I don't like the notch but there's a way to hide it so that works well for me

Apart from these small cons, everything is awesome with the phone. This is precisely what you call 'Value for money'

I got M30s on d 1st day of it's sale n since den I'm very happy with the performance of the device. D best part is 6000 MAH battery which wont drain easily even after a heavy usage in single day. Video capturing could have been better bcz there is some blurriness issue when u move ur camera in video mode. Rear Camera photo quality is awesome. Front Camera is good too. Very quick to read fingerprint and face to unlock the device. Exynos 9611 processor works excellent with 6gb RAM and very quick hence no hang issues or no heating issues.
At this competitive price Samsung has launched a great device.
Thanks to Amazon as well who delivered the phone same day even I am not a prime member.

Please don't buy phones from amazon they are frauds. Worst phone ever.
Firstly I got defective phone with a defect in display. Then I claimed for exchange.
After which today i received the phone. And I got the new phone with the same defects also the touch was not working properly.
Now i cannot return my phone. I need to go to Samsung gallery.
These is mine 2nd Samsung M30s i got both the phones defective..
Please don't buy any mobile phones from Amazon they are selling defective peices.

I don't have option for giving ZERO star..!

Samsung has launched an awesome, fantastic, and mind blowing product M30S mobile. It is having everything which I was looking for in my new mobile, except the processor, I was expecting more powerful processor than 96 series. But that is also quite satisfying when I played games like Asphalt, PUBG and Call of Duty on high picture quality. This mobile is well balanced in every manner. Thanks to Samsung. looking forward for more products in mobile and OLED TV's.
+ Pros: Realistic color, Bright display
✔ Yes, I recommend this product.

I have been using it for a week these are my observations :
Display is  top class
 Battery lasts for 2 days if use it lightly, for heavy users like me it's 16-18 hrs
Camera good for its price, especially slow motion, live focus and wide angle focus, front selfie is also good
Finger print and face recognition is also good
Build quality is ok for its price
Gaming is also good
Slight heating observed

Phone charger says fast charging but is not so it takes 2 hours to charge fully. Plastic phone body and screen is not a gorilla glass, also looks like a plastic feel up on touching. Saying all this one thing for sure battery is the final one. Although it's claimed to be 6000 mAh but phone does not stand for more than 12 hours if you are a avid user. Less than 10 phone calls and browsing of an hour reduced the battery from 100 to 40 percent. Then it's now your turn to decide upon.

Total waste of money, camera not working, phone restarting twice thrice a day. Battery still going good (The only good thing about this device).
Overall, a very bad experience till now. They say the camera is 48 MP, but it sucks. Even the camera of my older device captures much more realistic and better photos. Samsung really needs to work on their ONEUI as well. Too much of unnecessary notifications. It could have been a better device with stock android. Display is good though. But its not worthy to invest 16K on this device. Better go for some other device.b

Fingerprint is good and fast but sometimes it miss.
Back camera is super and night mode just ok
Front is good it will boost your color n soften the skin
Battery life is good n stand for more than one day. Charge time is very high more than 2.30hrs
Display is superb

There is cracking sound in the side of the mobile don't know why.

Build quality is average.
No back case provided, that's poor.
No glass protection

A below average product with poor processor and poor built quality- definitely not value for money. In this price range, you can go for any single handset in the market - Redmi, Poco, Oppo, Vivo, Moto anything but not samsung.
Some of the issues I m facing in first month of usage:
(1) It gets hanged very frequently. Forget about high end games like pubg and cod, you can't even play clash of clans without lag. At least this is not what you expect from any phone which promises 6gb ram and 128gb internal memory within first month of usage.
(2) Average camera quality : I was using Poco f1 earlier and I can bet on anything that its front camera of 20mp was far better than this phone's 20mp front camera . Also, Poco's 12mp rear camera was better than this phone's 48mp triple camera. Samsung is way behind brands like moto and Xiomi when it comes to camera quality in budget smartphones.

In short, you'll feel cheated by samsung if you consider any other smartphone in this price range. In short you can opt for this phone if you are looking for a Samsung tag and only want to use whatsapp, instagram, snapchat etc with zero gaming and you want to be the person looking for someone else's camera phone for pictures in any get together or event.

Pros - good battery,(1.5 days easily) ,display and decent loud speaker , no heating issues, any lag whatsoever while switching between apps.

Cons- network reception is poor, data speeds are less on WiFi n cellular.call drops / voice drops while moving from one room to another or while travelling .i use Vodafone connection, and my previous phones didn't have the signal issue.m30s doesn't display all the four bars ( max one or two) .While I insert the same SIM in a different phone ,I see full reception.
Flimsy build quality.pathetic headphone
Output( Dolby atmos- no way, I use a pair of Bose in ear headphones) ,slow finger print reader ..but yeah for the price tag we can't expect more..

Guess these days phones are just made for display, cameras ,high speed processesors, and internet ,with no foucs on call quality ,voice quality ,network reception ( sigh)..

Feedback after 4 days of use.

Samsung delivered what it had promised. Good camera, battery back up and nice look.

Charger cable very short. Can be charged using original charger supplied along with phone only
 If we use other charges it takes hours and hours to charge. Headphones not included. Body is prone to easy scratches.

In camera location not getting saved.
Auto updates not getting installed.
Seems some issue with inside GPS chip.

After discount and cash back, received it an effective price of 11700. Worth each penny.

Kudos to Amazon Delivery. On time as assured.

Amazon service is very poor. being a prime customer they took 4 days to deliver the product.
After receiving the product i checked it immediately. Being a defective product this cell phone didn't turn on. I exchanged this with my old Moto one power, right now i don't have any cell phone with me.

After taking exchange of my old phone and full payment  they are not responding properly. they are taking loots of time to solve the issue. I will look for one day and file the complaint in consumer court.

Purchased on 30th September.  But the phone  automatically  lost the network  on both my SIM on the 16th day. Got it repaired at the Samsung  service  center  at Mumbai CST which was a harrowing experience, but they didn't replace my phone as it got defective on the 16th day of my purchase,  and they have  replacement  policy only upto 14 days from the date of purchase. I have lost trust on the brand, and I feel it has the worst service centers in the mobile industry.

Except battery life rest every thing is mediocre .I am not sure if the camera is really a 48 mega pixel or 13 mega pixel. Not even a screen guard is provided.  so far in the last one month of use heating problem is not detected.  picture quality is ok nothing special in it, My earlier phone like Lenovo and Redme are having at par display quality,which I got at much lesser price.

Design and Display
Samsung took a little longer to adopt to the new design language of a notch display, and it all started with the Galaxy M series this year. The Galaxy M30 was one of the better design phone that Samsung introduced over its Galaxy J or Galaxy On series. The Galaxy M30s is not much different from the predecessor Galaxy M30 as well. It features almost similar design but with a new style triple-camera module and new color options. The back is still made of glossy plastic, and it attracts fingerprints/ smudges easily. Having said that, Samsung has done a good job in keeping the weight down (188 grams) despite a massive 6,000mAh battery.

Coming to the display, there is no change in the M30s’ 6.4-inch Super AMOLED panel. It still looks nice and offers full-HD+ (1080 x 2340 pixels) resolution with Infinity U notch. I had no problem with its touch performance, brightness levels, sunlight legibility and viewing angles. Samsung’s displays are usually oversaturated, so that part remains same on this phone too. Overall, the display quality is great for its price. I would rate M30s’ display higher than its competing devices – Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro, Realme 5 Pro and Mi A3.

Massive 6,000mAh battery we all wanted
The biggest highlight of Galaxy M30s is its massive 6,000mAh battery, something that we all need for our smartphones today. During my time with the device, it could easily last me about 1.5 days. In terms of the battery time for not so heavy users like me, the same battery should do fine for about two days for initial few months at least. The predecessor M30 also had a big battery, and it was 5,000mAh. So, just in comparison, the 6,000mAh battery is slightly better. The older mode M30 could also manage one full day on a single charge. That said, it is so much pain to charge this battery in one go, because it takes more than 3 hours to reach 100 with its supplied 15W charger.

Samsung Galaxy M30s: Camera

Coming to the triple-camera setup of the Samsung Galaxy M30s, it has been upgraded as well. Samsung has used its 48-megapixel primary ISOCELL GM2 sensor in the M30s, which is a huge jump over the 13-megapixel sensor seen on the M30. The other two lens in the setup are the 5-megapixel depth camera, and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens with a 123-degree field of view. On the front, the smartphone gets a 16-megapixel selfie camera in the notch.
Performance and One UI
Samsung has included its latest Exynos processor in the Galaxy M30s. The same chipset also comes in the Galaxy A50s as well. The device comes in two variants in India. It packs Exynos 9611 SoC along with 4GB and 6GB RAM options. The base variant comes with 64GB onboard storage, but the 6GB RAM model offers 128GB internal storage.

When it comes to performance, the Galaxy M30s works well in handling day-to-day tasks but lags a little with heavy multitasking. That said, I didn’t find any issue with the popular high-graphic PUBG gameplay. It worked smooth on the M30s, and there was very little load time. Also, the phone didn’t heat much during long sessions of PUBG.
Coming to the software, the M30s also follows other Samsung smartphones at present. It comes running Android 9 Pie-based OneUI out-of-the-box. Samsung’s latest One UI is a better software than many Chinese UI’s you’ll find in the market at present. That said, the company should improve upon the icon designs and gestures a little.

Should you buy?
At Rs 13,999 price point, the Galaxy M30s should be purchased for its battery and display over the competitors in its segment. The 6,000mAh battery does last long, but charging also takes even longer, which is a pain in my opinion.
Overall, the Galaxy M30s is a decent package which mainly kills the competition with its massive 6,000mAh battery. That said, the phone’s processing is just about decent. But the camera performance falls short from the competitive smartphones like Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro, Realme 5 Pro and Mi A3.

This phone is a real monster.
Pros-
1. Incredible looks
2. Great sAmoled display
3. Fluid like performance
4. Monster Battery
5. Superb connectivity- while watching the reviews on YouTube, there were some videos claiming that the connectivity of M30s is not so good. But I have been using in a low network zone with almost full network with single sim.
6. Super responsive fingerprint sensor
7. Good sound quality
Cons-
1. Camera- the 48 mp camera is a no good for me as I am a bit detail oriented when it comes to cameras which this phone failed to deliver in terms of quality.
2. No notifications led or anything notifying the charging status. Or anything else
3. A bit fragile and lower screen build quality-
 Given that I am a bit careless  user when it comes to handling the cellphones, I have to be more attentive now while using it.
4. Too much sensitive while portrait to landscape  orientation,  causes a bit trouble while watching  videos.

But I don't find any of the cons bothering me that much for everyday use, but the pros makes it a great experience  of owning this beast.

I bought the 128GB model for 13K in the festival sale. I would say this is the best for the price point. It has a huge amoled display which is too good. A decent UI (ONE UI), waiting for android 10/one ui 2.0 update.

*The main PLUS is the Battery it has 6000 mah powerful battery, as being advertised it lasts much longer than expected. nearly 2 days of moderate usage.
*The main drawback is the camera, a very low quality images. I personally don't like it, compared to my moto g5plus this has worst camera quality with numerous features. But again at this price point it is average.

Overall, battery is the major plus, camera amd plastic body with no protection is it's weakness. This mobile suits for people who would need a phone with high quality display, low radiation, nice audio, with a brand name on it, that can even compete beat oneplus 7T and other mobiles in battery life.

Special mentions,
*Dual sim plus micro sd slot
*Headphone jack
*voWIFI Calling
*Some cool one UI features namely palm swipe to screenshot, split screen apps, apps in pop up view, Dolby atmos audio and many more

Pros:
1. Amoled display
2. 6000mAhBattery
3. In Box 15W C Type Charger
4. Good camera

Cons:
1. Opal black color doesnt look good. The green color gradient looks cheap. Go for Pearl white even if you are a black lover.

2. No headphones.
3. Slightly bulky, but justifiable as it has a 6000 mAh battery.

Decent Gaming performance

CONS
Build quality is bad, small crack sound when holding
No glass back
Auto brightness is bad ..so bad
Selfie camera is bad ...
Back Camera is mediocre
Heating issue when opening multiple apps for long time.

It's definitely worth buying for 11700 mainly bcz of screen and battery but not worth buying for 14000.(Samsung need to work hard to compete with Mi).

Nice good  looking phone
Slim and smart.
Easy to carry  and if you didn't put the back cover it will easily fall down.
Mines got crack in the screen within 1 day of the phone delivered.
Performance is good
Camera is too good.
Battery not upto the mark
And overall phone is good  if you keep covered with case and tempered glass.
Replacement of screen costs around 580
This phone comes with free screen replacement but they will take more than 30 days time.
They will pay you to the method of advance cash worth of rupees 4899 excess amount we have to pay. This is the process of insurance.

Review after months of usage.Bought in first sale
Pros:-
1. Very good display with awesome colors and deep blacks
2. Snappy performance from ui to games like pubg and asphalt 9. Though asphalt 9 stutters in highest quality few times
3.Regular updates to security patches currently running November patch
4. Best battery. 1.5 days battery on heavy usage
5.Looks are good but buy back cover for safety
6.Audio quality and loudness is awesome through earpiece and speaker
7. Weight and thickness is ok does not feel heavy
8.Camera produces good pics with good colors and HDR from back camera

Cons:-
Only con I can think of is camera. Main lens is good and produces good images and videos but wide angle produces dull colors and details.

Slow motion is awesome but less details and colors.

Focusing speed is sometimes super slow. Sometime ok. This is biggest drawback because in video recording sometimes it takes time to focus and you can't just tap to focus everytime in video recording. Samsung should listen to users about this and solve this.

M30s seems to be a very good product. The cameras are great and gives us a very good output. The 40Mp shot needs the camera to be steady and give a 4:3 frame. no degradation on zoom. Battery lasted 2 days with youtube, games and watsup all going. The graphics are better and played pubg with high frame rate set. the hdr some times does gives slips.

Overall this is an average phone, with your normal usage you will get  1.5 days max battery.
Camara is ok ok not that great.
There were few issues I noticed with this phone I.e. mobile hot spot is not working in my phone dont know why, phone is not identifying or reading sd card.
And if is difficult to connect this phone's bluetooth to my car's bluetooth.

We have to always compromise with these things with low cost phone.

People put there who are planning to  buy this phone, please read all the reviews and make decision.

I already have an M30s and found it was exactly what I needed so I bought this one to give to my mother. I know she'll find it easy to use and she will also get plenty of pleasure with the capacity to load loads of apps onto the phone. Some people may find things to complain about, but for the price I am very happy with the phone's capabilities.

Fast delivery, great product with best price, when I opened the box the camera was very good in day and night time, but I got a new firmware update. After update the firmware the camera is degraded by Samsung, even in day light the camera doesn't perform well. Why Samsung desperately degraded the camera performance, I don't know. Samsung always deprived ther valuable customers. The main camera is now like a 5 megapixel camera. Chinese mobiles are far better than Samsung mobiles. Samsung has high vanity, they never ever realise the reality.

Just after 3 hour of working touch screen stopped responding, availability of this type of defective phones is not expecting from such big brands. This is why I can't give any review about the performance of the phone. It is understood from the above mentioned position that why such big brands go down.
Amazon replaced the same within 7 days. Replaced phone performance is awsm. Fingerprint reader, camera is of high quantity. Battery performance is very good.  Internet speed using 1st sim is very fast but using 2nd sim is not upto the mark. Overall performance is good i.e 4.7/5.0

M30s is an amazing powerhouse and a complete value for money phone. The camera is decent for those occasional clicks, it supports VoLTE and its battery capacity of 6000 mAH lasts for over two days with moderate use and at least for one and a half day on excessive use. The OS is lucid and there isn't any lag on the phone. Completely worth it.

Well i am writing this review after one day usage. So far i am more than satisfied with the product quality. The phone is great stylish in hand, display is awsome one must remember to turn on vivid mode. The number of themes and wallpapers provided by samsung is an amazing experience, battery backup nothing to say the best in world, camera is great, look wise the phone is also awsome i choose pearl white, sound quality could have been better but its fair enough at this price rate. The phone is suitable for delicate use hence if ur a bad handler like me suggest u to put a cover and screen protector, and try not to drop the phone. Best phone at this price wonderful job samsung.

I'll keep this brief. The pros:
Battery is great and lasts really long for normal use (No high end gaming). Camera is satisfactory. Display is excellent.

The cons:
Samsung UI is the worst I've seen on an Android. I'm biased towards OnePlus, so this may not be an issue for Samsung lovers.
-&gt; No deep customization options.
-&gt; Even clearing the system and app cache isn't straightforward.
-&gt; Lacks a proper app drawer. If you change your default launcher to another, dark mode doesn't work in many menus and apps.

The fast charging isn't really fast. I'm aware it takes longer to charge a 6000mah battery, but the bundled charger (15W) is nothing like the Dash charging.

Some apps crash frequently. I do not know if this is a problem with the apps themselves. However, the settings show very heavy RAM usage (&lt;1GB free), even when I don't have apps open and have restricted background apps.

The fingerprint scanner is not the fastest I've used.

None of the above is a deal breaker. For the cost, it's still a good buy.

At this price point M30s Exynos 9611 underperforms compared to Mediatek Helios P70 or SD 712 . But this can be overlooked bcoz this has good battery life ...but not as good as what we expect from 6000mAh battery yet its good when compared to most phones at this price point .I cant have any conclusion on cameras bcoz there are many smartphones out there at this price point can perform better than in some cases or as good as M30s .What I observed in M30s cameras was they are overly saturated n the the photos are a little bit on the warmer side .I love the software experience ignoring random stutters here and there .. theres no point in having samsung developed gallery app which has no option of viewing or importing photos n videos from samsung cloud ... this feature makes the gallery app special ..plz try to cover this feature in an update ...

This is review  afetr 15 days ..
Phone is very good .. you get everything  what you expect  in this price range .. most essential  thing tht is SUPER AMOLED  display  provided  by Samsung  which no one can provide  in this range ... phone speed is very good  even you can play pub g in HDR mode withouth any obstacle  ... yes but external  speakers  r little disappointing but tht doesn't  matter for me ... over all this phone is best for me ...

Phone is faulty with slow charging (taking more than 3hrs to charge) and micro phone problem. When you call Amazon helpline they ask you to try hard resetting, drain battery to 0% and try and then do testing through some dummy software.  3 calls / 3 days wasted.  Then they day technician will visit and confirm the fault but technician available after 3 weeks. No worries Sir, we will extend your replacement time and allow you to replace if technician confirms the fault. Now technician visited confirmed the fault and now they can't replace the phone. Now they are giving you refunds. I had purchased during sale period where I had got 2700 rs worth benefits plus free screen protection etc and now if I agian order the product I will lose 2700 rs benefit and screen protection benefit.
When you promise to extend the replacement window time but you dont replace and I have buy the same product at higher amount costing to my pocket.

Display is good as expected but processor is not up to the mark for gaming. Many games are not optimized for Exynos processor but even during normal operations there's a visible lag in the user interface. Performance is not snappy but if you enjoy videos then the screen will always enrich your experience. Probably future updates can provide better performance but for now it's very average.

Hi guys
This will be an honest review from my side
First let me start with pros then with the cons
Pros:
Phone is light even though it has 6000 mAh battery
Camera is comparatively good in this price segment
User interface is good
Wi-Fi calling option is available on this phone which is a plus
Sar value is good

Let me talk about the cons
Cons:
Design and Build quality is very bad..
Touch is not that responsive and I have not even used a screen guard yet
The worst phone to play pubg... Please do not buy this phone to play pubg.. it's a humble request.. even pubg triggers don't work on this phone..
Battery life is not impressive. One of the main reason for buying this phone is to enjoy the batterylife however it only lasts for 2 days...
 The phone that I used earlier was also giving me the same battery life ...what's the point of that additional 1000 mah
Signal strength is also not up to the mark
Sar value for the body is not mentioned in the booklet
And processor of this phone is slow... Not sure what's going to happen after a year

Overall im slightly disappointed with the phone...

Super cool Phone at a Wonderful Price tag
I would suggest everyone to buy

Also a triple camera Finger print sensor with Dolby Atmos sound, 6000mah battery super sleek with edge to edge screen ,super AMOLED  and what else do we require

Dushera and Diwali I got Double Dhamaka offer for the Best Phone
I m Totally Convinced after a long time that I have Purchased a worthy phone
Thank u Samsung and Thank u to Amazon

Firstly, a huge shout out to Amazon for delivering this phone within 3 hours of ordering it.

Now coming to phone:
It's a really pretty handset, the sAMOLED Screen is just awesome, and takes the viewing experience at another level.
Phone's speed is also very fast. 9611 is doing a great a job here.
Camera is great as well.

But the battery is just on another level. When I unboxed it, it had 42% of battery left, and in those 42%, it gave me around 7 to 8 hours of screen on time. When fully charged, it easily lasts for two days. I have even got more than 14 hours of screen on time in a continuous usage.
Really satisfied with phone. And discounted price at which I got it, makes it even better.

Very bad camera quality.

Tried returning the phone within an hour of receiving it but amazon did not take it back.

Decided not to buy any Samsung product or any other product from amazon without seeing it.

First of all if you want a budget phone under 15k and with brand value then M30s is the best.
I was using Moto x play ,which was stock android, transiting from Moto to samsung was little annoying  but 2-3 will get used to it.
As you all know the specification ahead below is the pros and cons of 15days usage.

Pros:
*Big 6000 mah monster battery, for a normal user with data usage,it comes around  2-3 days Average.rating=4*
*stunning  sAmoled display with night mode,blue light filter ,makes u comfortable  while using using it.
Amazing display.Rating=5*
*Camera - Although they claim it's 48mp camera ,but it's not bad ,with some  settings in camera u can get clear images.
And 4k ,slow motion video recording adds value to it.
*performance- with 4GB RAM and 64 GB memory u will get around 1.7 GB ram for usage
- some inbuilt  apps are added that u can uninstall it,if u didn't like.
-No heating is observed till now.
-Speaker volume seems little low, but trust me if using in earphone Dolby sound makes u amazing.
Rating-4*
-Got some updates related to software ,hope  to get this ahead by Samsung.
-OneUI launcher is smooth and user friendly.

Cons:
*If u are a camera geek and expecting more from this,then there are little cons
-Day light  is good,but there are some dynamic colors are added which feels the images are more colorized.
-night mode is not upto mark,which is ok ok.
-my Moto x play(21Mp) gives clear cut images ,and when I zoomed it in M30S images are distorted which feels some times whether it's 48Mp or not.
* Software updates might not be regular as in stock android (not sure bcas I am not samsung user).
*system memory consumed more but it's common in all.

OVERALL ITS GOOD BUDGET PHONE,RATING =4.5*
Just go for it  without second  thought.
 Buy good slim hardcase  to feel it premium.

Thanks
Srinidhi.

This is the best product in this price range. Battery is awesome, you charge it once and then forget about it for next 24 hours..
Camera quality is good. Viewing experience is good.

Camera quality is good, video viewing experience is also soothing. Screen space is good enough... This is the best one can have in this price range.

I am impressed with the display quality. Compare to redmi note 8 pro which is smooth gaming phone display colours are vivid and battery standyby is fantastic. But game is bit lagging. If u are pubg gamer, I dont prefer this. Not suit for intense gaming

Indoor lighting camera is poor but outdoor daytime photos are good

We cant expect much in this price and that too samsung brand. New UI is very good much more customizable options

Satisfied with the mobile for average user

The Samsung beast with best performance.
The face unlock and fingerprint unlock are much faster. The camera pictures are looks stunning and more detailed. 4k video recording also looks good. Night mode pictures are looks great and beautiful.
This battery beast, or stands about 3 days in single charge. Good phone to play games too. I found no lags while playing PUBG, that kind of impressed me.  The best phone display under 25k. Overall one of the best phones under 20k. Worth to buy and use it.

Got my M30s and overall happy to have a good phone from Samsung. Performance wise and battery life its really amazing and do delivers what Samsung is committing.

After using it for around 15 days, here are my Pros and Cons for this phone based on my experience:

PROS:
1) Very Good Battery Life (almost lasts for 2 days with regular usage).
2) Performance is really great.
3) No Heating or lagging issue at all.
4) Display is Top notch as always with Super Amoled HD+ and definitely it is far better than any other brand phones available at this price range.
5) Also has "Always on Display" feature which gives us a feeling of having any of the Flagship phone.
6) Super Slo-mo and Slo-mo features in Camera are also very Good and records really great videos.
7) Hyper-laps &amp; Super-steady Mode feature are also working nicely.
8) Fingerprint reader is also working fine.

CONS:
1) Build Quality is bit disappointing.
2) Camera quality which is one of the Big Highlights of this is not up to the mark. Specially the Front camera of 16MP is giving Bad results.
3) Rear Camera is also very Average. Specially in low light conditions it gives you very bad images. Samsung should seriously look into this matter and should update the its Camera performance.
4) Samsung should also provides either Case cover or headphones along inside the box but both things are not available with this.

Over all in this price range, i would say its a Decent phone with many good features but definitely disappoints in the Camera department which Samsung should consider on priority basis and improve via OTA update.

Excellent phone for this price point. Only caution- Handle with care.

Phone is super feature rich for 15K price point like - 6GB+128GB (no more worry for memory), Camera 48 MP (R) and 16 MP (F) selfie camera. Very good photos in most conditions. Finger print and face detection is very good. Phone Upgrade from Samsung is regular. From Amazon, I got 1 year screen protection warranty from Acko.

Few -ves#
1. At night or no light condition, the screen light is very much intensive and hurt eyes.
2. Photos plays from phone to TV does not come straight or right orientation, even though it displays correct orientation in phone.
3. Full battery charge take pretty long time. But half charged battery can go easily day with no compromise.
4. I have dual sim. Many time when I pick the incoming call, it got accepted but not connected with calling party for 15 secs or phone got disconnected. This issue is the most annoying problem with this phone as many time call drop happened due to this bug.

Finger print on screen could be better.
When imported pics from other mobiles pics are not quality.And camera is good but  pics looks like a if we edited the pic but not natural.
Good battery I charge daily once .
Screen shots still the same procedure holding volume and power buttons if it could be improved.
Overall Samsung is a trusted brand🙂I converted from iPhone to Samsung😆

Overall good product. No app lagged in day to day works. Good UI, and good screen.

I bought this phone due to 3 reasons

1) One UI
2) Display sAMOLED
3) good processor (good but not the best)
4) Good RAM management

Cons
1) Polycarbonate build. (Use good case)
2) No infrared
3) No the best smartphone for hardcore gaming, there is redmi 5 pro which is better for gaming.

4) Just one issues is with switch application, it shows a little lag when you move betwwen application. But once app is switched there is no delay what so ever.

Overall good product. Best smartphone in affordable category. I would highly recommend anyone to buy it.

Fingerprint reader :Pics can be taken by touching  finger print sensor, otherwise fingerprint  sensor is good.

Rear Camera:Day time pics are good. Night time pics sometimes  not as expected.
Front camera: I like the palm gesture to take the selfie, really fantastic.

Battery: There  are lot of apps which drains the battery  so fast. The user has to disable or uninstall  unwanted  apps. I am moderate  user and getting  2 days in one charge.
Build quality and Appearance: Excellent,but feel little  heavy due to large battery.

Bought this product with bunch of excitement and to disappointment myself with this filthy so called "SAMSUNG MONSTER M30S".
After unhoxing it will mesmorise you. Once you start to use the product you will relaize that it is just like an Aquaman which looks amazing but has no power.
Battery hardly works as 6000mAh. It will last longer for maximum 2 days if you shut everything and do not use with wifi/mobile data connection. I had redmi note 4 which was having lesser battery but worked more hours than this one.
They provided triple camera but when you use it you will see its worser than single camera phone.
Wide angle will stretch your pics to an extent you will feel that you are in 2005 again.
Please do not go for this as i was lured by those idiots celebrity's advertisements and fake reviewers on site.
Even fingeprint reader is worse...

◆Prons
●FHD+,Super AMOLED Display awesome experience,support 4k video.
●Screen to body ratio is nice.
●6000mAh battery is also best but it takes 2.3hr for full charge.
●48MP Camera is best and camera features also .like slow motion,super slow motion,4k video recorder,super steady video recording,AR emojis,selfie cam stickers,night mode is good.
●2.3Ghz,1.7Ghz Octa core Exynos processor ,decent performance.
●descent Sound out put, and also sound clarity,dolby atmos sound in earphones is just superp.
●it has 6000mAh battery but light weight design is also plus point.
●I'll definitely say go for it, Below 15000Rs.price range other mobile phones can't beat this monster. No.1 mobile phone under 15000Rs.cons are not that much.

◆cons
●Plastic body.
●2.30hr charging time.
●No front cam flash.
●finger print sensor is slow.but ok.

If you're going to buy this phone for it's massive battery then don't go for it a battery of 6000mah don't even last for a single day!!! Specifically I don't even play games on it. It's battery promises are totally fake and really too disappointing from Samsung family.

Apart from that camera is really very good

Fingerprint sensor is way too fast

Touch sensitivity is really good but doesn't work sometimes
Phone started the problem of heating slowly slowly but it's not even 1 months of my purchase

Only Battery is good ..rest of all things are worst.  Camera Quality is low when compared  with similar featured  phones.

Motion guesters  are not working properly.  Talk back services are working  worst.
Just after using for 2 weeks, phone got hanged,  when I want to open Gpay. Even though I am using 6 GB ram phone. Really disappointed  with M30s.

Fingerprint not very effective. Camera not up to expectation on 48mp. Battery, not up to expectation on 6k mah. But satisfafied. great phone after all. 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽

Now, April 2020: the recent software update, what is going on producers, unnecessary updates over and over. With this latest software updates, the notes and recordings that I have saved were all lost, also both the samsung notes and the voice recorder is not working now...fix it and stop updating for once.

This phone is simply an awesome product from samsung. The best part is the battery that lasts for about 3 days (standby and normal usage - no gaming) in a single charge. (100%) The camera quality is also so good. Fingerprint is too sensitive that you have to cover entire sensor or else it couldn't be recognised. The face unlock also gets a little bit messy sometimes. Apart from these minor uncomforts it's really a MONSTER.
The delivery was also done in lightning Speed and in a well packed box.

I am very happy to get this mobile phone. I have searched this type of mobile phone since the long time. I am music lover as well so. Good loudspeaker sound. And I hobby is photography, its superb camera gave me a good impact to click but it is little bit tricky to handle to get good photo. Battery life, face recognition, sensor, all are well equipped with dolby sound on headphone. I am satisfied much getting this samsung Mobile M30s, felling as I have samsung note series mobile in this affordable price range. Gaming go ahead no matter... thanks Samsung

The Samsung Galaxy M30s is a super good phone at this price. As i bought it on sale from Amazon and got card offer and another cashback offer.

Pros:
- Battery is too good 6000 mah. Full charge can easily make to 2 days unless in mobile data.
- Camera quality is good with 48 mp triple camera.
- 6.4" sAmoled display is large enough to  type, watch movies etc if at all watch on mobile.
- 4 gb ram seems to be ok in speeds with many apps open.

Cons:
- the phone does not have nfc, means it miss samsung pay.
- The glass is not water resistant  and can easily break. So needs to have screen and liquid protection plans which i bought for 1.5 k.

Its a monster as advertised and for this price very good. Look for offers and buy it along with a good tempered glass and back cover.

never used finger print on this as its located behind unlike my earlier Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 version.

I have really liked this new M30s phone from Samsung. I boight 6GB/128 GB variant and till this point of time very much satisfied with its oerformance. It has all the features I have been looking for in a smartphone and that too at an amazing price tag. I bought this phone on the very first day and got my old phone replaced. The phone works easily for 2-2.5 days on a normal usage and is what I have been looking for. The phone competely eliminates the use of power bank for daily usage. Now coming to display, I found it very crysgal clear high brightness and color. I didn't face any issue while using my phone in dayloght and works well even at angles. UI is also smooth and looks clean and elegant. The response is fasg, thabks to the new processor which has been used in this phone. For a customer like me who looks for a phone in the range of 15-16k this is the best one can get and that too under Samsung brand. Although the camera is not that great but given the price at which the phone is being offered I am ok with it.

Review after using for 15 days..

Pros -
1) Battery backup is exceptionally good.. Using for the whole day, browsing, games, Facebook  still left with more than 50% battery end of the day..
2) camera quality good..
3) fingerprint reader is fast.
4) 3-3.5 GB of RAM always available in spite of  apps already running..
5) touch response is very smooth..
6) Doesn't feel heavy in spite of the big battery capacity..
7) speaker sound is loud in max volume.
8) The screen is best, HD, BluRay movies are smooth and Vivid..

Cons
1) High quality movies ( 2GB size) have hard times loading from SD CARD (maybe its jst my card's fault)
2) The most disliking thing which struck me was wit the messaging app. SMS automatically converts to MMS even while words are not even more than 30-40!! Its just sooooo annoying!
(I am using other sms app for now)

Will update again after 4-5 months for the durability..

I am not happy at all with the product, so much advertisement and so little value. I highly do not recommend this phone at all. 48 Mp Camera does not work at all.if you select 48 MP for capturing the phone it took at least 30-50 sec to save the image and many a time it shows camera failed. 6000 battery last only for 1 to 1.5 day only. Screen is good, face unlock is good. fingerprint is also good but you can add only three finger. I mean seriously.
I bought the phone mainly because of camera and i am highly disappointed.

I will never buy a Samsung phone in my entire life again .. with all the greatest processor and ram in the phone , the bloody thing lags .. how stupid is that .. a China phone works way faster than this one with less configuration .. I regret buying this phone .. please do not buy this phone unless u wanna buy for your old people who plays very little with the phone.. the display and the battery life is awesome..

After almost 2 months of use i again lowered the star. It's their most flagship 48mp that disappoints me. Great for video shoot not for still photo. It doesn't capture texture great. No shutter control for long exposure photography. Image are not sharp in landscape, also mention poor texture capture. However macro are acceptable but not great. Gaming is fine but not great. Videos will lag/skip if played for long period, especially in Facebook app and YouTube

Samsung Galaxy M30s
The phone with a massive 6,000mAh battery.

Samsung Galaxy M30s Review
Big battery, longer battery life

Samsung launched the Galaxy M series at the beginning of this year to strengthen its position against Chinese competition. The sub-Rs. 20,000 segment was dominated by multiple models from the likes of Xiaomi and Honor, many of which offered better value for money than the devices that Samsung was selling at the time. As a result, the Galaxy M series was launched with a strong focus on the online market.

The Samsung Galaxy M30 (Review) was one of the most high-profile models in this series when it launched at around the Rs 15,000 mark. This smartphone sported an AMOLED display and offered good battery life. Samsung has now launched an updated version of this smartphone dubbed the Galaxy M30s. Does it improve on the M30's strengths and fix its weaknesses? We put the Samsung Galaxy M30s to the test to find out.

Samsung Galaxy M30s design
Most Samsung smartphones in the Galaxy M series sport similar designs on the front, with the Galaxy M40  being the exception thanks to its hole-punch display. The Galaxy M30s sports a 6.4-inch full-HD+ AMOLED display with a dewdrop notch at the top, which Samsung calls the Infinity-U display. The panel has thin bezels on the sides, though the chin is thicker. Samsung has pushed the earpiece towards the frame of the smartphone and it sits just above the selfie camera. While the earpiece is small, we did not have any issues hearing our callers on this device.

Samsung has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right side of the device. We found the power button to be well-positioned but the volume buttons require you to stretch your fingers. At the top, the Galaxy M30s only has a secondary microphone, while the USB Type-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, and loudspeaker are on the bottom. Samsung has put the SIM tray on the left side.

The crisp AMOLED display on the Samsung Galaxy M30s makes colours pop

The Samsung Galaxy M30s sports a triple camera setup at the back which is placed in a rectangular camera module. The fingerprint scanner is also at the back, next to the camera module, and it is easy to reach. Samsung offers the M30s in three colour variants: Opal Black, Sapphire Blue, and Pearl White. We had the Sapphire Blue version in for review, which has a gradient finish at the back. This looks a little different, and we like it, though this may not be the case for everyone. You can opt for the more traditional Black or White colour options instead.

Samsung has fitted a massive 6,000mAh battery into the M30s, which is bigger than the one its predecessor, the M30 had. This phone is rather bulky but since the back is curved it is manageable in the hand. Samsung ships a 15W charger in the box.

Samsung Galaxy M30s specifications and software
The Samsung Galaxy M30s sports a 6.4-inch full-HD+ AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080x2340 pixels. There are two colour modes to choose from, and the phone is set to Natural by default. We changed the display mode to Vivid which boosted the contrast and looked more pleasant to our eyes. There is no way to adjust the colour temperature of the display but we were happy with the default settiing.
Samsung has picked its own Exynos 9611 SoC for the Galaxy M30s, this is the same processor the company has used for the recently launched Galaxy A50s (Review) as well. This SoC has four performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.3GHz and four efficiency Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. It also features integrated Mali-G72 graphics.
The gradient finish on the back of the Samsung Galaxy M30s looks good but it may not be to everyone's taste

The Samsung Galaxy M30s is a dual-SIM device and has two Nano-SIM slots. There is support for dual 4G as well as VoLTE, Bluetooth 5, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, and the usual sensors.

Samsung ships the Galaxy M30s with One UI 1.5 on top of Android 9 Pie, and our unit was running the August security patch. We have used the same UI on several of the Samsung Galaxy smartphones that we have tested. This UI is designed with reachability in mind, and so most system apps and menus can be pulled down so that tappable areas are within reach, making single-handed use easier.

Digital Wellbeing, a popular Android Pie feature, is available along with the Wind Down mode which switches the screen to grayscale and sets the phone to DND to help you unwind. There are a few other features such as Dual Messenger which lets you run two instances of supported apps. Samsung puts the Super AMOLED panel to use by offering an always-on display option. This lets you glance over notifications and other alerts on the lockscreen (along with the time) when the device is locked.

The smartphone has some bloatware, most of which can only be disabled. Preinstalled apps include Facebook, Netflix, Galaxy Store, OneDrive, and My Galaxy. We found the My Galaxy app to be the most spammy of the lot, and had to block all its notifications. The Lock Screen Stories option dynamically changes the lock screen wallpaper on the smartphone.

Samsung Galaxy M30s performance and battery life
The Samsung Galaxy M30s has a good display, and watching content on it was a pleasant experience. It gets bright enough outdoors and we did not have issues with sunlight legibility. The Exynos 9611 powering the smartphone is capable of delivering a smooth experience without any hiccups. We could navigate through the menus and launch apps without any stutters. The fingerprint scanner is also quick to unlock the smartphone and did not require multiple attempts. There is face recognition as well, and the smartphone is quick to unlock after a successful scan.

We ran benchmarks to check how the Exynos 9611 fares against some of the other processors used in phones at around the same price. In AnTuTu, the Galaxy M30s managed to score 152,453 which is lower than the 178,570 scored by the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro (Review) with its Snapdragon 675 SoC. However, it isn't far behind the Realme X (Review), which scored 155,897 points with its Snapdragon 710 SoC. In Geekbench 5, the Galaxy M30s managed single and multi-core scores of 355 and 1,310 respectively.

The selfie camera sits in the water drop notch on the display

As for graphics benchmarks, the Galaxy M30s managed 40fps and 14fps in GFXBench T-Rex and Manhattan 3.1 respectively. The Redmi Note 7 Pro managed 41fps and 15fps in the same tests. This shows that the Exynos 9611 is in the same league as the Snapdragon 710 SoC.

I played PUBG Mobile on the Galaxy M30s, and the game defaulted to the high preset. The graphics quality was set to HD and frame rate set to High. There were stutters at these settings, which prompted us to drop the graphics quality. I played the game for 20 minutes and noticed a 4 percent battery level drain. The smartphone was barely warm to the touch after gaming.

Battery life is the highlight of the Galaxy M30s and the 6,000mAh battery does help this smartphone soldier on for a very long time before it needs to be plugged in. We could go on for two days with our usage involving an active WhatsApp account, running benchmarks, taking camera samples, and playing about 40 minutes of PUBG Mobile. When the battery does run out, the supplied 15W charger is capable of charging the phone to 22 percent in 30 minutes, and up to 43 percent in an hour. Charging the phone completely takes about two and a half hours

Samsung Galaxy M30s cameras
The Samsung Galaxy M30s sports a triple camera setup at the back, consisting of a 48-megapixel primary sensor with an f/2.0 aperture lens, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with an f/2.2 aperture lens, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. The primary camera takes 12-megapixel shots by default, but you can capture 48-megapixel shots though the toggle is clubbed with the aspect ratio options. The camera app on the Galaxy M30s is very similar to what we have seen on recent Galaxy M-series and A-series smartphones.

There is an AI-driven scene optimiser which helps the phone recognise what it's pointed towards and set things up accordingly. It has multiple shooting modes including Pro mode which lets you take complete control of camera settings. The Live Focus mode on the M30s lets you set the level of blur before taking a shot, and you can also change it in the gallery app later. Other modes on the Galaxy M30s include Food, Night, and Panorama. Switching between the primary and the wide-angle cameras is easy and can be done using a toggle switch.

Photos taken with the Samsung Galaxy M30s are decent, and look good on the phone's AMOLED display. Daylight shots had average details on zooming in, and while text on objects at a distance was legible, it wasn't crisp. The phone meters light properly but it does not have the best dynamic range. The wide-angle camera packs more into each frame but there was a noticeable loss of detail compared to shots taken with the primary sensor. I also noticed barrel distortion at the edges.

Low-light shot from the Samsung Galaxy M30s (Tap to see full-size camera sample)

Low-light sample clicked with Night mode on the Samsung Galaxy M30s, notice the crop.

Pictures shot in low light lacked detail and were grainy on zooming in. Photos shot using the Night mode were brighter, but the Galaxy M30s crops the frame, so you will need to take that into account when setting up a shot.

Macros shot captured with the Samsung Galaxy M30s

We noticed that the Galaxy M30s was a little slow to lock focus when shooting macros. This reminded us of the Galaxy M40 (Review), which had a similar issue. As a result, you will have to be patient with this phone. While shooting in low light, the camera takes even longer to lock focus increasing the chances of you walking away with a blurry shot. Once locked, the camera managed to deliver good details with a natural bokeh between the subject and the background.

Portrait shot on Samsung Galaxy M30s

Colours popped a lot on the AMOLED panel but looked more natural when viewed on a computer. Portraits turned out well and the phone managed good edge detection, but shots taken in low light had slightly lower quality. Selfies clicked during the day had good detail, but the level of details drops in low light.

Video recording maxes out at 4K for the rear camera and 1080p for the selfie shooter. We noticed that there's a 10-minute time limit when recording in 4K. Video shot in the day at 1080p was stabilised. Samsung has also added the Super Steady video mode which switches to the wide-angle camera and crops the frame. Video recorded in low light was stabilised but had a visible shimmer effect.

Verdict
The Samsung Galaxy M30s can be seen as an upgrade over the existing Galaxy M30. It retains its predecessor's good attributes, such as the crisp AMOLED display, and bumps the battery capacity up to 6,000mAh which helps deliver better battery life. The new Exynos 9611 SoC is more powerful than the Exynos 7904, and offers similar levels of performance as other popular processors at the same price point in the market.

The cameras on the M30s are one area in which Samsung still needs to put in some work. We often found focusing to be slow, and the camera performance in low light was below average.

If battery life ranks very high on your priority list, then you should consider the Galaxy M30s. Interestingly, this phone shares a lot of hardware with the Galaxy A50s, which we recently reviewed, and if you were considering that model, the Galaxy M30s could offer much better value. If you are looking at the base variant of the Galaxy M30s, the Realme 5 Pro and Redmi Note 7 Pro  are suitable alternatives. If you are willing to pay for more RAM and storage, the Realme XT  offers better value.

I will say this to only 3 types of people ,don't buy this phone-
  1. Pro or heavy gamer.
  2. Pro photographer.
  3. Those who drops their phone often(like me😉😉).
  Now for others or normal user-
  This is the best device u can have under 15000/-
  I bought it for my uncle in great indian sale and believe me i am quite impress with its performance in terms of 1.design(holding in hand)
2. Processer.(not gpu)
3. battery backup.
4. rear camera( colors,saturation)
5. Ui( for me its the best ui with many useful features)
6.Audio through earphone.(afterall its dolby atmos)
7. weight (It feels like a phone with only 4000mah battery)
and obviously
 8. Display( best display under 30,000 devices).
9. Dot notch ( i personally like it)

Camera quality and battery backup both are very low on quality and whatever has been claimed in add is rubbish. Even the vedio quality is very poor in comparison to any normal phone . And the 10 day replacement given by Amazon is just nothing but to fool you- as even if u don't like the phone once you purchased it then you can't change it as it is only replacement with the same another phone. So once purchased on Amazon then u have to take the liability of the phone for self and no refunds from Amazon.
 Always have very bad experience with Amazon.

I've been using this phone for almost 3 days now and believe me it doesn't disappoint you if you choose to go for it. Having used Poco F1 before this, I do feel a difference in performance. But here are the pros and cons as per my usage so far.

Pros:
1) The sAMOLED display is amazing on this. The AMOLED displays of Samsung are on another level when compared to other manufacturers and this fact gets evident when you start watching videos on it.
2) The Battery: It's amazing to say the least. I've used this phone for three days, that too almost on data all the time and hardly charged it twice. If you are an average user, you can easily expect 2 days of life without plugging in the charger. Adding the screen on time details in the images.
3) The UI : Probably the most surprising aspect for me. I have never used a Samsung phone before because of the custom skin touchwiz which Samsung had been using which was notoriously slow and memory hungry. But the One UI one this phone is pretty feature rich and appears to be light on the memory.
4) I am probably in the minority here but even though the body seems to be made of plastic it certainly feels pretty good in the hand and it isn't really heavy given its mammoth battery.

Cons:
1) The day to day performance is seamless and should not be a problem for a normal user but somehow the 9611 processor and the mali G72 GPU don't seem to handle heavy games adequately well. Heavy gamers should skip this phone.
2) The Camera is a big let down to say the least, doesn't work like a 48MP in anyway.
3) I should probably not complain about this but the 6000 mah battery does take almost 3hrs to charge from 1-100.
 This is what I could think of so far. All in all this is decent phone in this price range and you could definitely consider it unless you are a shutterbug or a heavy gamer.

Guys, please avoid to buy this phone, this phone do not have proper battry backup amd it hanged some times. Also network has been flutuating. After all this non sence issue, amazon customer support told me to do not compare this phone with other brand which is having 4gb ram, 5000mhz battry and it is perfoeming well. Also as per new policy of amazon they will not take replacement of the product till technician will check this product. So ideally amazon do not have trust on customers review. This is pathetic i have to use this defactive oroduct till next week.

I had an eye for this phone when it was launched by samsung and ordered it on its launch date. The delivery was very quick. I ordered it on Sep 28th noon and got it in my hands on 29th morning. Unbelievable! Because this is my first quickest delivery in my overall Amazon purchases. Thank you Amazon and STPL online store.  Coming to the unboxing, this phone is having a killer display and the form factor is very much satisfactory. Though Its little bit weighed more than other phones because of the monster inside, but when holding it in hand it is so firm, sturdy and comfortable. When I am saying comfortable I mean it. This is due to its sleek and slim factor.  On the back it is polycarbonate plastic but it's not attracting finger prints. For me opal black is so beautiful than sapphire blue. So I ordered opal black and i am happy about my decision. Display, oh you can watch it over a day without boring. The display is crisp and colors are awesome. Previously I had nexus 6 with its amoled display but this one is having sAmoled which is more superb than that. But you need to enable vivid color mode through its display settings. By default, It will be in natural mode. Media playback and gaming colors are very pretty to view on this screen and the touch is very responsive. Now it's not dull when coming to the overall Performance. The exynos 9611 and Mali GPU does its job very efficiently. In gaming I tried different games like Real racing 3, PES2019,NFS no limits and Call of duty mobile. Since pubg is CPU intensive and more YouTube videos available of its gameplay in this mobile, I tried PES2019 and other games. I can assure that you will not be disappointed with its performance. Games can be played upto high settings without hiccup. Ultra high may have some lag. But high setting in this display is like a feast to the eyes. Even after prolonged gaming also this device is not heating up. It is little bit warm but nothing to expect more. And the monster battery is not discharging even after heavy gaming and media playback. I charged it on 29th noon and it held up upto 30th night with 27% of juice left. Unbelievable when comparing with my nexus 6. I changed from my nexus 6 due to its random shutdown problem and my decision to go for this mobile, worth it. Camera, I feel like its little bit lacks here in capturing details. It is not poor but satisfactory. I expect more from its 48MP shooter. This could also be due to poor light conditions or because of my lack of experience in shooting in different modes. 48MP takes some seconds to capture the shots. Its having slow motion and hyper lapse camera modes which I found very good. Night mode shots exceeded my expectation. Overall it's a very balanced device in which you can expect it for HD Media, Gaming, Camera and for prolonged usage. Comparing with newly arrived phones in market under 20000 this will be very much VFM device. Hold it in hand and feel the difference.

Pros
Display: Its very good 4.2/5
Speed: Decent 4.3/5. Using from last 8 days, no hanging and no lagging in normal use.
Battery: 5/5. Battery is great 2 days backup on single charge in normal use.
Camera: 4.5/5. Video and Camera is very good. Lot of useful options wide angle, slow motion, speed motion, 4k, stabilisation.
Make: Make is decent at this price.

Cons:
1. All samsung SAMOLED display are bit yellowish even after disabling blue filter as compared to normal IPS screen. Samsung mist correct this. IPS screen have better white color reproduction.
2. No notifocation LED. It must be accomodated at this price
3. Body Color options are very less.
4. Adaptive brightness did not work couple of time but overall ok.
5. Cover and Headset must be given free with box in14k to 17k phone like this. Its difficult to find proper cover later on.

Bought M30s for below reasons:
1. It's Samsung
2. AMOLED screen
3. 6000 mah battery
4.128 GB storage.
5. Rs.13999 launch price.
Guess what, its adorable and works seamlessly,  gives feel of a flagship phone.
Camera, YouTube,  downloading, speed of operation, user friendly interface, is all i need and i don't play pubg so battery last 1.5 days easily.

Everything is good except network issue. I had contacted my network company and Samsung help but none of them had resolved my problem. The phone leaves the network whenever the phone was not used for more than 15 or 30 minutes. And the problem is only with my current SIM card.. I had visited my network provider's help centre and after checking everything they said that there may be some problem in the handset. People who want to contact me are facing problems. Except this everything is good... camera, battery, screen... I'm facing the network problem since the first day.

Awesome product
Camera has a disadvantage of not AI futures.

Looks of Product is okay. Camera Quality of both sides is very bad, pictures are blurr, hasy, not clear. Battery backup is not satisfactory. However, I tried to return the product as it was written that "Eligible date to Return or Replace the Product is till 3-Nov-2019" but Customer Care Executive denied to return the product.

What should I do with this product, my money is stuck. Very Bad experience. Please do not believe Amazon's services in Electronics &amp; Mobile items. They just cheat and makes money and fun of the customers.

Design and Display
Samsung took a little longer to adopt to the new design language of a notch display, and it all started with the Galaxy M series this year. The Galaxy M30 was one of the better design phone that Samsung introduced over its Galaxy J or Galaxy On series. The Galaxy M30s is not much different from the predecessor Galaxy M30 as well. It features almost similar design but with a new style triple-camera module and new color options. The back is still made of glossy plastic, and it attracts fingerprints/ smudges easily. Having said that, Samsung has done a good job in keeping the weight down (188 grams) despite a massive 6,000mAh battery.

Samsung Galaxy M30s

Coming to the display, there is no change in the M30s' 6.4-inch Super AMOLED panel. It still looks nice and offers full-HD+ (1080 x 2340 pixels) resolution with Infinity U notch. I had no problem with its touch performance, brightness levels, sunlight legibility and viewing angles. Samsung's displays are usually oversaturated, so that part remains same on this phone too. Overall, the display quality is great for its price. I would rate M30s' display higher than its competing devices - Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro, Realme 5 Pro and Mi A3.

Massive 6,000mAh battery we all wanted
The biggest highlight of Galaxy M30s is its massive 6,000mAh battery, something that we all need for our smartphones today. During my time with the device, it could easily last me about 1.5 days. In terms of the battery time for not so heavy users like me, the same battery should do fine for about two days for initial few months at least. The predecessor M30 also had a big battery, and it was 5,000mAh. So, just in comparison, the 6,000mAh battery is slightly better. The older mode M30 could also manage one full day on a single charge. That said, it is so much pain to charge this battery in one go, because it takes more than 3 hours to reach 100 with its supplied 15W charger.

Samsung Galaxy M30s: Camera Review
Coming to the triple-camera setup of the Samsung Galaxy M30s, it has been upgraded as well. Samsung has used its 48-megapixel primary ISOCELL GM2 sensor in the M30s, which is a huge jump over the 13-megapixel sensor seen on the M30. The other two lens in the setup are the 5-megapixel depth camera, and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens with a 123-degree field of view. On the front, the smartphone gets a 16-megapixel selfie camera in the notch.

During my time with the device, both cameras performed average for its price and competition. In the daylight condition, the rear camera does outshines with the 48-megapixel lens. Also, the wide-angle camera does a good job. But the problem is with the low-light performance. Samsung made some big claims during the launch for its low light capabilities, but in our tests the phone couldn't do a good job. The shots lacked detail and looked grainy to us. Even the night mode was of no use in that situation. I am assuming that Samsung should be able to fix it via an update. But that said, the camera overall isn't good in front of the likes of Realme 5 Pro, Mi A3 or even Redmi Note 7 Pro.

Performance and One UI
Samsung has included its latest Exynos processor in the Galaxy M30s. The same chipset also comes in the Galaxy A50s as well. The device comes in two variants in India. It packs Exynos 9611 SoC along with 4GB and 6GB RAM options. The base variant comes with 64GB onboard storage, but the 6GB RAM model offers 128GB internal storage.

When it comes to performance, the Galaxy M30s works well in handling day-to-day tasks but lags a little with heavy multitasking. That said, I didn't find any issue with the popular high-graphic PUBG gameplay. It worked smooth on the M30s, and there was very little load time. Also, the phone didn't heat much during long sessions of PUBG.

Coming to the software, the M30s also follows other Samsung smartphones at present. It comes running Android 9 Pie-based OneUI out-of-the-box. Samsung's latest One UI is a better software than many Chinese UI's you'll find in the market at present. That said, the company should improve upon the icon designs and gestures a little.

Good product for the price, the battery despite being 6000mAh drains by day end with decent heavy use. Display is awesome, camera is just average, the cable provided in the box is tooo small, had to get a new cable, fast charging works well. No earphones or back cover in the box was a disappointment especially because no good back covers available at of now.
Overall decent phone for the price

Samsung Galaxy M30s has the best display that is super AMOLED in this price range
And the camera quality is awesome 👌 in low light it is good in this price
Night mode is also for low light condition
The Exynos 9611 is good enough
It also Runs the PUBG in HDR + Ultra fps
The battery life is awesome that it has 6000 mAh but
It won't be fill heavy in hand
The weight distribution in the M30s has the fantastic it just weight only 188gram and has 6000mAh battery 👌
The Network and Internet speed is also best I compare form Redmi Note 7s
But In video Recording the live focuse is some issue Samsung should give an update on M30s

But Overall this is Best in this price Segment
I will give 9/10

Its a manufacturing defect in ALL M30s as the back of the body is not fitted properly to the body...when u press a little, the body shakes and makes noise as if it has come out from rest of the body...Its a design failure, product failure by Samsung...Mr. Jeff should be asked to answer as to why his Company Amazon is selling such Sadakchaap products and cheating the customers!

After 15 days using this phone, I totally disappointed by this phone because of mobile data speed( Ping time is to high) u can't get ,even I am using Airtel VOLTE SIM. Since last 10 years same service provider ok am using &amp; in previous I was using  MIA2, there was no prob. Again I tried to put same SIM in old MI A2,I m getting perfect data speed. This thing I complained to Amazon on 6th &amp; 7th Nov, they have instructed me to download one app from Play store, they tested &amp; replied that there is no.issue, but when I explained evey that even I have changed new SIM from same provider. Then Amazon care instructed me to do the Hard reset the phone &amp; Ur problem will be solved. After doing Hard reset  this problem doesn't solve. I feel Amazon have only kill the time to close the replacement time. Now I totally disappointed &amp; this is the waste of money, even I have given the complaint to Amazon with in time they didn't replace my phone.

It's an amazing phone for the price. I have no complaints as the primary reason I purchased it was for the battery and it lasts insanely long. However, I have recently been facing an issue with recieving calls. Ot gets stuck in the "Incoming call" mode. I got it checked. Apparently its the phones
fault.  The camera is good too
 I like the wide angle mode. But the clarity of pictures and pixels is low. The front cam has pretty low clarity.
The performance is okay, there have been instances where the screen has malfunctioned and also the screen glass is really really delicate. Would suggest to buy a tempered glass along with the phone as even one drop can break the screen. volume is good.

Its First time that I'm buying a SAMSUNG Smart Phone. I was pretty excited to order the phone. And I got it on First Sale on First time as a Amezon Prime Customer. But somehow I don't know this product is not up to the mark.

Attractions for Mobile
1. Camera is good as far as I see
2. Features and Price Range.
3. Obviously the SAmoled Display is + point.

Defects I Have seen in My device.
1. OS is reacting little slow when I use multiple apps.
2. Auto Brightness Is a Failure in this.
3. Flight Mode is working Slowly.
4. Processer is not up to the mark. Can be upgraded.

Over all At this Price Range (17K) (6GB+128GB). The mobile is good but SAMSUNG should focus on the defects that I have mentioned and hopefully they will come up with a new Version to upgrade in the devices.

Best Work from SAMSUNG is what people believe and its Brand Value people love.

So dear SAMSUNG please keep it that.

Finger print reader is okay, camera quality is not at all satisfactory,very dull photos and poor quality not at all like 48MP rear camera,  selfie photos are okay. Coming to battery life even my old phone of 4000MAH and this 6000MAH doesn't  have any difference  in working hours and standby time.

Best thing is the Amazon offer and using it, I got it for 11,600.

Pros:
1. Great super amoled display (night mode, always on display, great sharpness, eye-catching colours).
2. Fast processor (Exynos 9611, good ram management, decent gaming).
3. Superb battery life (easily last a day even with heavy usage and 1.5 day on moderate usage).
4. Fluid One UI (with lots of features and updates).
5. Sound is also good.
6. Expandable storage (UFS 2.1 storage, dedicated microSD slot).
7. Best after-sales service (Samsung brand value).

Cons:
1. Plastic build (feels cheap in hand).
2. Camera are not that good (like Redmi Note 7 Pro) but I am sure Samsung will improve it by giving future updates.

So, cons are for now but hard cover can be used to avoid plastic feel and camera will improve in future for sure.
In short, it is the best deal under 15,000 for now. Go for it.

Samsung really turned the table by launching this product.

I am using this phone for almost 3 months now.
When it launched I checked all the reviews in youtube, all was against it. But I went very carefully by its specifications, and bought it. And I proved myself that I was correct. On this budget you will get MI/other brand phones but you wont get the
1. interface (if you dont use MI phones &amp; samsung phones u cant relate eg. Customization options, user daily useful options, &amp; many more ),

2. display (compare playing a hd video on MI phone with full brighness rest u gef to know)

3. Camera (wide lens is awesome, super steady mode, 48 mega pixel true, it is compared with phones price range till 50k)

4. All rounder (game, app, camera, display, sound [atmos supported], battery, what else do you want?)

5. If your budget is 15k then go for M31 (#dekhoterabaapaaya)

This device is an all-rounder when it comes to overall performance. The mammoth 6000 mAh battery, vibrant s-amoled display and an extremely useful and intelligent feature-rich Android OS powered by the Samsung One UI makes this phone extremely competitive among its peers in this price-segment. The Exynos 9611 SoC is powerful enough to handle daily multitasking like a pro. The camera however is of decent quality, the front camera struggles to shoot selfies in low light/artificial lighting conditions, I feel Samsung could do better with the camera in natural lighting conditions. In a nutshell, it will be safe to say that this device will never turn out to be disappointment for anyone looking to buy it considering its holistic performance.

This Samsung phone has thoroughly let me down. Purchased it with great expectations, however, so disappointed with its performance. Phone getting no sound in between the call and the when u try to call again mobile not reachable. Someone called for a feedback and told them the same issue and he informed saying he has taken the comment and will ask the technical team to contact me. Great service by Samsung the so called most trusted brand none had called till date after 2 months of registering the complaint. Never thought AMA ain’t products are also so pathetic. Never again......

Pros:
No other phone has these many features compared with this price range.
It has Super AMOLED
UFS2.1 which is masterpiece compared to other brands with EMC5.1 storage type. UFS Storage is more faster than EMC ones.
Memory has LPDDR4X with 3200MHz speeds. Others are 1866MHz. Flagship phones are running with 3200MHz right now. You will not get 3200MHz this in other brands with this price range.
Exynos 9611 is almost equivalent to Snapdragon 845. Just little more features which is not major difference.
6000mAh is a monster, no other phone with this much battery and with this price.

Features should have been into this:
1. Finger print is in the back, should have been into front, but it's fine, things are still working
2. Due to low SAR value, I think we get a little low coverage as compared to high SAR but not a major difference.

Camera quality is okay even though it hangs a lot. Focusing is absurd. Fingerprint sensor is an utter waste. Sometimes it don't even know if the finger is there or not. And with the massive battery of 6000 MAH, it provides me 24 hrs of standby back up. My take is, don't waste your money on these range of samsung products. I'm writing this review after using this product for almost 8 months. Terrible and pathetic experience from samsung again.

I like the phone. Camera &amp; speed of the phone is really good in this range. Battery Backup is something which I like the most. Overall look is good, I purchased black color version. Screen is amoled, dedicated sd card slot are things I needed.
Cons is -- little bit heavy, little bit thick (as compared to other phones in same range), charging is slow. Samsung must improve their chargers.

Third grade product I have seen from Samsung in my life...48MP camera should need to be improved a lot . Also front camera is very dull and pic looks like a 5 MP camera ....Even my 10.OrG camera is good then this samsung one ....
M30s is my big mistake which I did in my life instead of REALME XT which is a good mobile then M30s....
Shame samsung ....What you did with fake 48 MP camera

Samsung has taken the fight to the Chinese with this one. It's a compelling package in terms of performance, display, huge battery and price. The phone feels premium (except the back) and the amoled display delivers crystal clear images and the blacks are truly black. I'm yet to test the camera extensively but first impressions are impressive with great image quality.
The one negative I found is that because of the screen design, while holding and watching videos, scrolling, e.t.c, you inadvertantly tend to press parts of the screen which triggers unwanted commands. A back cover is probably recommended.
Overall, thumbs up Samsung.

I have Samsung m30s which is 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and 6000mah battery with Exynos 9611 processor
1. If I talk about battery life it is just amazing "ab Mai office jata hu to charger carry Nahi Karna padta hai" with this statement you can imagine how powerful battery life Samsung M30s has

2. Next is 6GB RAM and Exynos 9611 processor that is powerful till now I am not facing any issues but when you play games in high definition like PUBG, Call of Duty you will see some frame drops but this happens very less "apko pata bhi Nahi chalega or na he irritation hogi bus ye samajh lijiye iski wajah se apko koi game me hara Nahi Sakta hai" but I believe this can be zero because when you do lot's of stuff in your phone and at the same time you start play games in high definition definitely you will face such frame drop but if you close background running apps then everything will be smooth I do in same way

3. If I talk about Camera that is also very good but I personally don't use much camera but for photos are really good "bus itni hai apko iski photos se embarrassed Nahi Hona padega" and low light photos are really good whether it is front camera which is 16mp or back camera which is combination of 48,8,5 MP in few word " Maza a Kati hai photos Dekh ke".

4. Now if I talk about sensors you will get all sensors in this phone but I found fingerprint sensor is littil bit slow my Lenovo k8 note has much faster in this case "or Baki to sab mast hai you will love it"

5. Display and touch: display of this phone is really amazing and touch sensitivity is " aisa touch Maine aaj tak Nahi Dekha is price range me" this is what I can say about the touch
But it has no screen protection of gorilla glass so be careful while dropping your phone

6. Build quality is also very good personally I liked it

7. UI : I will say you will love one UI because it has lots of new features which you will love.

I the end I just want say yes you can buy this phone in 16999 and one thing more which I feel about battery that everyone is saying it takes 2h 20min to charge phone from 0 to 100% that is true but if you charge your phone daily it hardly takes one hour because at the EOD phone has remaining about 30% so it takes less time in my case it can be different for others but sirf charging ki wajah se Dinah mat divert Kate Kuch or reason hai to alag ki Baat hai

This phone is really good in this range

I just got this wonderful phone
Without taking much of time
I would like to divide its pros (plenty) and cons (few )
Pros
1.amazing battery and battery backup
2.one ui
3.plastic body (for me plastic body aint a con its much more practical
4.camera (i am a average camera user as per my opinion back camera is awesome it has minor bugs for focussing but when it does it captures amazing photos .selfie camera is good not the best but in good light takes wonderful selfies.my favourite mode is the night mode
5.sound -loudspeaker is adequately loud but not too much but when it comes to headphobe jack guys seriously hands down it just destroys all its compitetators at this price .just in advance sound setting enable uh scaler and u are in for a treat .so loud and clear
7.features of one ui
Had to say this differenty as it has a lot
Night mode
Blue light filter
Always on display
Dolby atmos
Screen mode vivid and natural
Digital well being
Battery optimisation and so on
8.last but not the least its display
The super amoled is the usp the best display i  have ever used  under 25000
Now to cons
Minor selfie issues
Minor focussing issues
A little (very little slow fingerprint reader but fack lock compensates with super fast opening)
So overall it has a strong hardware so these issues can be easily fixed with ot updates in
I am not a great gamer so i did play ashfalt it ran without lag .
In totality a great phone under buget segment truly the monster has arrived

Nice phone with great features including your personal emoji at an very attractive offer. M30s is real deal if you want worth the spend item along with durability and at par features and quality. For me it killed my iPhone lookout and I stopped my search with samsung. Will recommend it to people who need good smartphone that's updated and loaded and will survive for good 2-3 years (cycle of new buyer's)

Thanks Amazon

Samsung launched it with so much hype of 6000mAH. Overall, it's a good phone considering  the cashback and instant bank discount and the specs. Phone is light weight and sapphire blue looks so much trendy. Camera is awesome. But the major pomp and show of 6000mAh battery doesn't seem great and seems a book value only. My previous phone of redmi note 4,with 4000mAH used to last longer than this phone. User interface  of phone is also good. All is well if u don't have high expectations  from 6000mAh thing  battery is good but doesn't last 50% higher than usual phones, instead it drains much faster.

I love you... Try out... You'll love it too

Was searching for a budget smartphone and thinking to go for some Chinese Brands like the one I had before but then I came to know about release of this phone. For the sake of getting a good phone from brand like Samsung at unbelievable price, I think the wait was worth it.
Delivery was the best as I got the phone in my hand within 4 hours of placing the order during Prime Early Access.
I am using the phone for since then and faced no issues till now. Let's see what it have on its plate for future.

Writing this review as I got call from Samsung Executive asking for rating I would give to the phone. I said 5 as no issue till now and really enjoying the features. Then he insisted to share the same on Amazon and here I am ;)

Attached are few pictures of device and few pictures clicked from device using different features of camera. I was sitting at the terrace of my house while writing this review and saw a plane going so tried to click the picture of plane with moon in the background. Same is attached for your reference.

Thanks for reading my review.

Those who are writing network issue, heat/hang issue or battery issue, i think they don't know how to use a phone and how to report any issue.
My phone usage is heavy, continuously using for several purposes and here is my honest review (I'm technical person so i know technical aspects)

Display : Samsung rocks with AMOLED display, awesome.

Performance : Super, if you manage your background apps and services, it will give more than enough performance.

Camera : Really good (Far better than oppo/vivo/Mi and other brands, except iphone anyway), but clicks at night time or low light it may be average if object is moving and flash is off, for steady object it is good. Front &amp; rear both have good output in both images &amp; video recording.

Body : Super smooth and color is too good (it is not my concern any way)

Battery : Best battery performance I've ever seen in smartphones. On first day,100% to 0% drain with heavy and continue use took 1 day 3 hour 27 minutes till auto switch off, in super power saving mode enabled in settings (only call/sms) it may standby for 3 day minimum.

Overall awesome phone with budget adjusting price, don't compare with RealMe XT as it doesn't have such battery &amp; brand reputation.

First of all I would like to write about

1-Fingerprints: because I gave only 4 ⭐.
Sometimes this is not working properly. Wet finger may be caused behind this. (Overall good)

2- Camera: it's fantastic. Yet now I clicked more than 200 photos from this phone.  So I can say this is well whether you click the photo in day/night or any time. But the clarity of pictures depends on you that how are clicking.

3- Display: This is super almond display so nothing to say much more about this. Superb

4- Battery: This is low waited power bank set up by Samsung. You can use It minimum 1 day anyhow. It's not matter how are you using.

5- Processor: yet now I haven't faced any kind of problem relate this. So can say easily fantastic.

6- Sound: Since I haven't much knowledge of sound so can't explain. But this is good for me.

7- Color &amp; Design: I booked in opal black color this is well.

********Negative points***********

1- Headphone: Company doesn't give headphone with this phone. Which is not is good in this range.

2- Phone covers: We don't get cover with this phone by Samsung.

(The company must give these both facilities to customers)

1⭐ for Amazon also because delivery was too late. I got it after 8-9 days after booking.

A complete package from Samsung ❤. 6000 mAh Battery (15w charger in the box), Full HD sAmoled Display 😍😍, Triple Camera ( 48 mp main sensor), Powerfull New Processor. What else u need ??. 6000 mAh Battery is Monstrous. You will easily get 2-3 days of battery backup on a single charge. &amp; sAmoled Display is just awesome 😍😍. You will love it. The smartphone is a whole package if you want a branded smartphone rather than a Chinese smartphone. ✅ 10/10 ✅.

PROS-
1. Best for daily Usage and Day to day tasks at this price point offered by Samsung.
2. Super Amoled Display is just Amazing.
3. Battery SOT is superb.
4. Clean and Simple ONE UI.
5. It has 6000 MAH battery but does not feel so.
6. 48 MP Camera is superb in Daylight conditions and it also supports Camera2Api.

CONS-
1. Not For heavy Gamers yes u can Play PUBG but Instead search for SD processors.
2. Build quality is ok ok type due to Polycarbonate back and no info. About any glass protection
3. Selfie camera images in low light can be improoved.

Otherwise Nice phone you won't regret After Buying just Go for it....

I have used this phone for a while now and this is my first ever Samsung phone. The design  and colour is awesome. 5 on 5 for display and seamless performance till now. Games like pubg work well. Battery back up is super. Over all an amazing phone and value for money. Only 2 cons,selfie camera isnt that great but good and it takes more time to charge the phone even with high voltage charger.

It's a nice midrange phone from Samsung.
Processor shows some lag while opening normal apps like Facebook, Amazon etc to name a few.
Overall it is a good package to buy.
Battery on full charge lasts for a day.
However to charge the battery fully it takes 5-6 hrs(not sure if device is faulty).
Although it's supposed to support fast charging however in 15 mins it charges 15% and after 30% charging speed slows down drastically.
Battery charging is a major issue.
Also nowhere description says it is India only SIM.
While checking with Amazon they mentioned you need to have Indian SIM to start the phone then any SIM card across the globe can be used. Not yet verified. On can check with Samsung for the final answer.
Traditional physical finger print is fast but not faster than Motorola phones.
On screen finger print is not the fatest and also not very accurate in A50/A50s, so compared to that M30s physical biometric is more accurate.

After complete one day used result.
1. Battery performance is not as expected. Samsung claim 6000 mah but actual its not, it's look like 4000mah battery.
2. Display is good.
3. Camera is not as expected, front is 16 MP but acutal its look 8MP , same about rear camera, you will see noise in camera, depth camera is good, some camera effects are good. Overall camera is Ok but not upto the mark.
4. Phone body is plastic must handle with care, if you drop you'll lost.
Samsung little bit disappointed this time.
Result : Good

After use of this phone, I found that fingerprint reader is working fine. Camera quality is good as expected. &amp; As per battery life I would prefer to say battery performance is not as much as it should be due to 6000 mah, it's battery is not performing as expected. Moto one power with 5000 mah I was using and that was same as this 6000 mah.

Pros:
Monster Battery- Literally it's a beast. It can last almost upto 2 days with moderate usage.
Size- Hat's off to Samsung for packing the huge battery inside this handy device and keeping the weight in check.
SAMOLED dispaly- Great viewing angles with vivid colors. Awesome experience during outdoor usage.
Exynos 9611 processor- High performance without lag and optimised power consumption.
Camera - Back camera quality is very good. Slow motion hyperlapse features are cherry on the top. Front camera is also great.
Biometric Locks - Fingerprint reader and face detection are smooth and very fast.

Cons:
Plastic body- Easily catches fingerprints and scratches if used without cover. Samsung could have provided plastic case at least with the phone.
Front camera - edges are little bit soft in low light selfie.
Back camera- Edges are not that much crisp in Portrait mode.

First time I purchased phone from ecommerce site (Amazon) and believe me I am more than enough satisfied from this phone camera quality is awesome speed of phone. I guess I was the first in my company who have this phone and all my colleagues eyes was broad after seeing and after that few of my friend ordered the same. Sorry to tell you that I didn't find any dislike in this phone yet. For me it's just spellbound.

Pros:
1. Fast one day delivery.
2. 6000mah battery is enough for two days with normal usage.
3. Super Amoled display is just awesome.
4. Without case, phone is pretty light, slim and gradient black with green color looks actually quite good.
5. 15w fast charger is OK.
6. Games : Free runs fine with smooth settings. PUBG runs fine with smooth HD settings. other games just runs fine.
7. UFS 2.1 with Exonys 9611 processor will run all daily normal apps
8. One UI is better than MIUI , Color OS

Cons:
1. Price should be around 13K. currently it is 15K. you will get redmi note 8 pro at this price range with 64mp camera, helio g90t processor, glass back and all....but doesn't matter for samsung lovers.
2. Camera is not as 48MP as mentioned. It has 16MP quality.
3. No notification light. find very irritating. samsung should bring it through software updates .
4. PUBG will lag at higher settings . can't play it for longer hours too. so use it for 1-2 hour gaming.
5. FIngerprint scanner is average.

Verdict:
Go for it if you want bigger battery and super amoled display and low SAR value.
Don't Go for it if you want PUBG, glass back, notification light

My last phone was MI max 2, which I've bought only for it's massive battery and was surprised to see that it actually exceeded my expectations. But this massive 6000mah battery of samsung m31 doesn't work like that and drains pretty fast when compared to max2, so I have to say am not totally satisfied with this phone.

Well before purchasing any phone, I researched in details and finally I focused on realme xt, vivo z1pro and m30s. XT was costly and Z1 was not having type c charging port  finally buy m30s because of battery, super amoled screen and my trust in Samsung as a brand. After 1 month I feel it's a great phone and I am fully satisfied with phone's performance in its budget. If anyone is planning to purchase a new phone explore mi note 8 pro if you trust mi, otherwise go for this one it's a great phone.

When confused on what to purchase in the mid-range, then you better go for Samsung Galaxy M30s.

Fingerprint reader:
Works pretty good and response is fast most of the times unless you have wet fingers XD.
It can also use it to scroll down notification bar.

Camera (rear and front):
This is exactly like what you will expect from all the reviews. Delivers perfectly. Wide angle is superb. Scene optimizer is a like a cherry on top. You can make super-slow-mo videos and night mode will blow you away XD.
One the bad side, the pro mode does not provide the option to control shutter speed which I really wanted. Thus you can't take long exposure shots.

Battery life:
Well it will last longer than you lol.

Games run pretty smoothly, no worries there. Heating is not much.
Sound quality is sharp and loud enough.

The Camera is over hyped, except for Night snaps other features are commonplace now. Massive battery is an advantage. 4 Stars for getting exactly what you are paying for. I am being reasonable after all you are not paying a fortune for this device and it delivers the performance accordingly.

Face recognition works. Just in case anybody says it doesn't, don't believe him.  Sound , screen are all fine but nothing extraordinary.

I have bought this phone on Amazon.Using this phone for 20 days...No issues found at all...Great camera with an Excellent performing wide angle mode. Monster Battery service...Charge it once and use it for next 30 hours Without any  In power saving mode it can last more...Camera is awsome,.Nightmode pictures are great...And best part of the phone i like the Display 😁 Excellent performance of display. No  so called" Hang issues of samsung " i have faced yet..Value for money product in this price range. Go for it.

The phone on a whole is a good one considering the price point.

Pros

1. UI is good
2. Build quality is decent
3. Camera quality is good
4. Display is good stands out from the rest
5. Battery lasts a day
6. Mobile is light weight

Cons

1. Fingerprint recignition sometimes when dirt is there does not recognise.
2. Battery could last longer considering 6000mah, it comes for me around 16 to 18 hours on a normal usage.
3. No time stamp in camera pics.
4. For me one more concern was when you listen to built in FM radio and also navigating using Google maps, strangely the FM radio volume does not reduce for the voice navigation in Google maps. Samsung pls look onto it.
5. Also when FM radio is paused using earphones while listening , and when we try to resume it after 2 to 3mins, it does not resume ,again you need to turn on radio by unlocking your phone manually.  Samsung pls look onto it, other major mobiles does not behave like this, this is bit annoying.

Overall i would give 7/10.

Considering price point and these minor issues ,its a good phone by Samsung.

I don't want to go more deep technically so that common people understand.

Brand : Samsung ( already established and one of the best brands)

Price : reasonable

Build quality : based on the price, it is upto the mark.

Camera : 48 mega pixel ( what else you are expecting in this price)

Memory : All kind of variants ( I bought 128 GB not much difference in price so I go with 128)

Battery Capacity : 6000( compare to other phones way more sustainable. This is one of the important thing for us. Because at last after 1-2 years durability and sustainability of battery matters for us)

Extra memory slot for unlimited storage.

Best for gaming and watching movies ( i watch 3-4 movies with one go with full charging)

I know processor is not snapdragon flag ships but still it's not bad.

So I recommend this phone to everyone who thinks about budget and wants best phone in budget.

-Good and timely delivery by amazon.

-A decent buy for the price.
-Ordered Sapphire blue 6gb/128gb variant.
-Super Amoled Display at this price is pretty good.
-Performance no lag, runs smoothly.
-Good battery life, lasts more than 1 day with normal usage.
-Speaker is decent.

-Camera is the Biggest Drawback of the phone. Both front and rear cameras are below average. Daytime pictures are decent and low light pictures are poor quality. No where near 48MP sensor. Selfie camera is the worst.

-Despite fast charging takes a long time to charge.
-Build quality is average, with plastic back.
-No additional accessories besides charger.

-Overall, a good buy for the price but camera is a big let down.

The phone as whole package is a good one. Except of little things here and there, I liked the phone. The screen is probabily the highlight of the phone. It's beautiful and bright. The software by Samsung complimented such amazing screen. Vivid or natural,  choose whatever you like, I usually like natural colors but vivid really shows capability of the screen, gamers might like it. Battery of course is huge. Currently did binge watching Young Sheldon during my tour and the phone really hold up to long duration of watching. Battery saver mode pushes it even more. Camera is average in my opinion. But you can't expect more at such great price.
Only wish the speakers were better. They are terrible and songs doesn't sound so great. Earpiece speaker is also very loud. When speaking to someone on call I can feel the back of the phone vibrating when they speak.
All in all, really impressed by this phone. Worth the price and deal.

I believe in Samsung products. My very first smartphone was from Samsung and it worked really well.
Now coming to M30s i believe its a powerhouse under a good budget.
1. Camera quality is a pro. You wont regret it even for a minute. The only thing is you need to change the ratio to switch the camera to 48MP.
2. Battery life is just amazing. I used my phone for straight 1hour for gaming and all i lost was 10% battery. I wasn't expecting this. Also it takes less time to charge a monster of 6000mah. Again not expected.
3. It comes with samsung smart apps and makes it a whole better experience.
4. Comes with gorilla glass and supports VoLTE and dual 4G sims.
5. Special features like night mode and blue light filter makes it relaxing for the eyes.
6. Dolby atmos for all the music lovers makes it a treat to plug in headphones and listen to your favourite music.
7. Auto call record feature which can be switched on/off makes it yet again easygoing.
8. 4k video recordings is all together an absolute dslr experience.
9. AR emoji app the one you've see in apple ads so far is here in Samsung. Again really cool and fun to use.
10. I am still finding out about new features this phone is capable of and so far there isnt a single drawback that i came across.
Thanks alot Samsung for bringing this delight to your customers.
Easy on pockets and features like never before.
CON:-
This samsung Galaxy mobile has some connectivity issue. Internet works poorly and also earphones when plugged in do not connect. Even on a call the voice is unable to be heard. Really poor connectivity issue.

I'll be straight to the point.
-Fingerprint reader doesn't register when finger touches it partially. You need to have the whole finger pressing on it to work. I have used 2016 model k6 power Lenovo and it recognises partial finger print to unlock.
- Front cam is bad... It's like 2MP. Low light is even worse. Some how the photos look pixelated and flat. I have tried 'open camera' app, some improvement in quality but it's really not that good.
-Back 48MP cam is good. It doesn't feel like 48MP but the photos look good. Video super stabilization is amazing.
-No Google camera support. Although it somewhat supports Gcam 2.7 apk but it also crashes.
- Battery life is good, I get around 12hours+ heavy screen on time.
-Face ID is really bad. The front cam struggles to identify face in low light. It takes a couple of tries to unlock.
-Network issues are there, I'm getting two less bars in m30s compared to other phones in the same zone.
-Compass &amp; Geo magnetic sensor does not work properly. Needs to be calibrated everytime to use GPS(rotate the phone in a '8' spiral manner 3 times)
-The only good factor of the phone is the battery nothing else.(1.5 days heavy use)
-Screen is huge, superamoled and vibrant. No complains here.
- No Haptic Feedback in this device for touches. I downloaded Google Keyboard to enable Haptic feedback in keyboard presses.
-Plastic back attracts fingerprint and oil. Black colour is better than blue or white. If you are buying go for black.
- A few milliseconds slow in opening apps compared to other phones of same price as m30s
-Bluetooth 5.0 Connectivity is fast but range is small. Doesn't connect between walls of room.
-Touch UI 1.5 is fast and efficient
-Rememeber when setting up device to deselect advertising else advertisements are shown in the notification panel. Also deselect installation of bloatware.
-No optical image stabilization in either cameras.
-Next android 10 + One U.I 2.0 has arrived for m30s.
- Battery takes 2 hours for charging 6000mah. Fast charging is good.
-No headphones or back cover provided in packaging for Indian variant.
- It's a dual LTE phone.
-No complains with headphones, mic, volume and power buttons, or even the speakers.
-i received my phone in 4 days from amazon.
My final take would be not to buy the phone. Go for any other brand other than m30s. Check YouTube reviews properly first then decide which one to buy.

Delivery by Amazon was awesome ordered on 28th night and got it on 30th ,Monday morning even I don't live in a metro city

I purchased  4+64 GB variant, out of this only 1.7 gb ram and 51 GB storage was left after preinstalled apps.

Pros:
1)6000 mah battery ( max output mentioned is 5870) so for this price range it is best.
2) 48 mega pixel back camera is awesome,  Back camera is really amazing

3) Night mode is very good, compared with realms 5 pro ,it's delivering better  quality  at night
4) 6.4 SAMPLED Display

Cons:
1) it is taking almost 3 hours to fully charge, 15w fast charger doesn't do the job here.
2) Front camera is not much good it's just average.
3) RAM Managment is not good only 1.7 GB ram was left after the preinstalled apps.
4) no earphone
5) no back cover
6) no tempered glasses

However for this price range it is good, battery lasts for over a day once you fully charge if you are continuously using internet

I have been using Samsung M30S since 2&amp;½ weeks, and here are some of the pros and cons.
Pros:
1. Camera is of great quality works better in day light and video recording is at par.
2. Battery life is too good, when fully charged it works for almost 36 hrs after playing games,watching videos and using social media platforms. Clearly it's the USP of this mobile.
3. Processor is nice as I found no lag while playing game(  like Real Racing 3). Also works smoothly while switching between the apps.
Cons:
1. In low light camera lags a bit and night mode is not that great , still at par.
2. Sometimes it gets heated while playing games, but game booster helps to control that.

All I can say that device below 15k and Samsung brand is clearly a win win.

DEVIPRIYA : It was a nice experience with this model. Camera is really good. But still have a feeling like why there is an option for 48 mp cam separately. Why they didnt give for main camara. As of now main camara has 16 mp clarity only. Battery is awesome once fully charged its get 20% after 1.5 days for me even am using data and playing games. Handling is very nice and face recognition, finger print authorization, voice unlock are working awesome.

1. If you're someone who's looking for a great battery life on a smartphone then this one is best option for a mid-range smartphone.
2. camera quality is average doesn't click great detailed pictures.
3. It has got the best display among any smartphone in this price range.
4. Since, it's "SAMSUNG" after sales service is really good unlike brands like realme, oppo etc.
5. Software experience with ONE UI is really good, it's very fast and responsive and no lags whatsoever. It keeps most apps in memory.
5. fingerprint scanner is decently fast but not the fastest out there. But the worst part is we can register only 3 fingerprints at the max.
6. It's a good a plastic back and needs a really good cover to protect from fall damages.

Overall, a good deal for the price. I would take it over realme 5 pro or the realme XT anyday.

This is a beast of a phone!
Have been using Android phones since a long time and every time you are in the market to buy an android you find phones that have some features and lack in the others.
Samsung galaxy M30s is not that phone. This phone has everything that you would want at the right price.
The phone has an amazing battery. Have been using it since the last couple of days and charged it only once and still have 50% left.
The display is great - Amoled 😊
The phone is fast and responsive! - the 4Gb ram is good enough for daily use.
The CameraS 🤤 48MP at 13k price!!! Pictures are stunning. I love the wide angle mode.
What else do you want at this price??
Haven’t tried for gaming yet but I am sure it would be great as well.
Go for it! It comes with the Samsung trust 👍 Unlike other companies where I have struggled to get a good customer service in the past.
I am happy to say that I am switching back to Samsung after a long time and couldn’t be more happier 😊😊😊

I even didn,t install unnecessary application, i HAVE INSTALLED ONE SOME SOCIAL MEDIA APPS,

REQUEST NOT TO PURCHASE ITEMS FROM AMAZON

Camera as light sensor eats lot of battery. Also I'm not comfortable samsung taking photo without my knowledge to measure light. Phone speaker voice quality is not good. Phone is bulky, heavy, takes lot of time to charge. OS on this phone is not optimized, eats battery. I was using j5 pro, it was a wonderful phone. Not seeing much difference of using 3 camera to take one photo. Bokeh mode is software blurring, not based on focus. 48 mp camera just uses lot of size to store poor quality image. Increased rating from 1 to 3 after 4 weeks. Battery life improved after disabling adaptive brightness.

Slightly disappointed with this product in few things. The network reception is poor as it keeps fluctuating between 4g 3g and 2g ( not a network issues as signal strength is very good in other phones). Though the phone boasts of 6000 mah battery i find that battery is not lasting for very long as expected ( again everything is optimized in background and no power consuming apps). Camera quality is not upto mark as should be for 48mp.

I am using from last 15 days..I review on this product is below.

1.Userinterface is smooth.
2.Good features like digital wellbeing,devicecare,we can use apps as popup window,darkmode,widevine l1 support.
3.Display good..
4.Multitasking is good but need to improve .
Battery not up to the mark.
Camera in daylight performs well but at nyt some times it struggles.
5.front camera need to improve alot.
6.Little lag some times but not  noticable.
Build quality is just average.(need to use good screen protector and back case).
Phone becomes little warm while using camera but I think it will be in all mobiles.
7.Fingerprint is slow compared to other budjet mobiles.

My final point is those who are not heavy gamers can buy this mobile undoubtedly.

Note: Samsung has to give regular updates and improve the performance of the device and keep the samsung brand value..(It is end of october but still it is running in August security patch only)

The battery backup is major highlight it stands up to 1.5-2days.Finger print sensor &amp;  face unlock is decent.Rear camera is good 48mp mode is produce little more bit of details &amp; dynamic range is also good &amp; livefocus mode produce natural bokeh effect  but night mode is not upto level.Video is better than photos The super steady mode &amp; super slow mo videos is just awesome.Selfie camera produces natural colors but little details if you zoom in you will see the skin smoothening.The build quality is average my unit has produce some cracking sound on middle of the phone it has annoying.Over all its ok.

This is my 3rd samsung phone since 2011. I just trust the brand.
Coming to M30s...
 1.Battery life is mind blowing..
2.Screen display is awesome..way ahead of Chinese counterparts.
3.Processor is ok..good as of now..hope it stays the same.
4.Camera is good....haven't taken much pics till now though....but feels average when you compare it with Redmi note 7 pro...Redmi is miles ahead...in dt dept.

5. Build quality is average..the back panel quality could have been better..n..more...premium...but again it compensates this deficiency... by a brilliant battery n super amoled screen display and quality.

6. Features such as...Blue light filter...night mode..face recognition etc..etc..is icing on the cake.

7. Should have given at least a cheap...silicon back cover with the set....no good... back cover available  till now in local market or even online. . there is a waiting period of 15 days...which is the main problem.

8. Rest... how it performs in the long run only... time will tell.

Hope this review helps u all..
Happy Durga Puja.

Although phone is good...but they have not given bluetooth headsets which was supposed to be with box as it was clearly mentioned in box and warranty card in box.

It seems the box is already tempered or disturbed to remove the headsets from the original box which was with the phone as per samsung company

Writing this review after 1 week of usage
1. Camera is very good... Especially ultra wide mode
2. Battery even though its mentioned as 6000mah, it's behaving like 4000mah.
Draining faster than expected after installing apps.
38 hours(1.5 days) battery backup for normal usage without any games, Unlike 48 hours (2 days) as promised by Samsung.
3. Finger print scanner is good but definitely not the best... Sometimes doesn't detect
4. 108Gb/128Gb of internal storage available
5. Phone looks very nice... Buy back case immediately to avoid scratches.
6. Speaker sound quality is good
7. Could have included a ear phone in the box
8. Dedicated SD card slot is added advantage

Overall nice budget phone but battery not upto expectations is very disappointing.
Giving 1 star less because of battery

At starting I thought that it will be a normall midrange phone just with a large battery inside but after purchasing it. I realized that it is more than a normal midrange phone. Like it has the crisp and big FHD+ display and the camera quality is stunning the build quality is also pretty much good and handy. The screen to body ratio is 91% means that you can see nearly no Bessels just a small chin at down side of the phone. And what about the finger print sensor it is the fastest just one touch and the phone unlockeds at an lighting speed. And the most important highlight of this phone is it's bigger and larger 6000mah battery. It gives more tan a one day battery backup at an normal usage. I really appreciate the Samsung's efforts to give a such great specifications in this phone at such a low price. I am really enjoying using this phone.

This phone is really amazing. I think one the best products by Samsung still date. The aggressive pricing and the discounts offered by Amazon through different debit/credit cards, added to this phone's charm. The camera quality is really amazing. It gives you so many options while taking a pic. Really a great camera. The battery life is also good. While iam writing this review the battery is at 63%, I had charged the phone yesterday  morning. I have received and made various calls, played a few games, went on WhatsApp made some online payments and it's still going strong. It should last me a whole day today and probably have to recharge it tomorrow morning. And this phone is a total value for money phone. You get a lot many things for a very less price. This is a phone I had been waiting  for for quite sometime. I hope Samsung is able to bring many other phones for cheaper price tags. It's a great buy. And thanks to Amazon, I got this phone very much in advance. Thank you very much  Amazon.

When I got the phone the panel was not properly closed. I got afraid but I just pressed and it was fine. Amazon side - great as usual.

My detailed view :
So it's been more than a week with my mobile! Explored all the features I guess. I have listened to some suggestions from utube and explored on my own also..
Pros : one ui - like in one plus they have a little features enhancing ui.
When I'm calling colours wil come and move
Samsung themes apps r there where u can get different free and paid themes wallpapers and icons
Always on display feature also u can download something so that it wil b displayed always. I have downloaded small panda 🐼 photo
When u r searching something in settings below it wil b giving suggestions. Do u want to know about this setting? like that
Ar emoji camara
Extended view camera
Other amoled specific apps like swift key android pie features r always good
Gallery options are also good
Notification panel options
DARK MODE IS AWESOME here
They have given extra facility to listen to dolby audio when head set r Bluetooth device is connected
Last but not least, battery - u select power mode it will give definitely more than 2 days

Cons
Camera may b not so great. When I select to take photos work 48mp its taking time to save
Finger print is back side
Little glitches in some features when I select something I felt like it's not working
Samsung installed so many extra apps for running
Fb and Netflix it had given which I cannot even uninstall. I have 128gb luckily so no need to bother about it.
I lost other customised features by one plus.

I bought this phone for my father.  His primary use is calling, What's App, Facebook and Youtube. Hence went for a phone which has good screen and longer battery.  This phone has everything going for it except the camera. It costed me 12,600 after 10% off on SBI card and got 1000 extra cash back in Amazon pay.
- Good form factor, easy to hold
- light weight considering 6000mAMP battery.
- Very good and vibrant screen
- Dolby ATMOS - very very good sound through good set of headphones
- Humongous Battery - lasts almost for 3 days

Things that are not up to mark are
- Camera - really disappointed with the camera quality. Xiaomi Note 7 Pro (my friend has it)
- The phone back cover has dual color which looks cheap.  External mobile cover is recommended.

I took this for great display and massive battery life.
It has a good clean OS unlike other chinese smartphones that are filled with many unnecessary apps and ads.
But I have to say that I am disappointed with this product.
Does the job of an average 9000 INR smartphone.
Better consider M10s or A50s.
Got the product in an exchange.
Maybe amazon gives refurbished products to customers who opt for exchange option. Do the needful while considering this product.

Screen is best in the price segment.
But in bright sunlight it's not very bright but you will able to see the things.
Speaker are good but not loudest
Back camera is poor as its f2.0 so don't Capture enough light and picture are not sharp. Real me 5 pro has the best camera in this price.
Front camera very good but not the best.
After heavy usage battery will last for entire day.
Plastic body is of very cheap quality it give sound on little pressure.
Processor I didn't find it fast as it shows some lag may be I uses SD card that's why it's not that fast.
So it's basically screen and battery that you will be paying for rest everything is of below 8k budget phone.
And all the reviews on you tube regarding this phone is paid reviews so beware.

Don't buy device heating up a lot while making and receiving calls. It goes uptown 35degree celcius. But Amazon representatives saying that it's normal and within acceptable limit. Imagine that how can it is possible to keep 35 degree celcius warm device near your ear for about 10 to 15 min, sometimes even more for longer call. Waste of money and device, bad product from samsung and Amazon. How can a manufacturer itself can set a norms for their own device ? Don't believe the advertisement, samsung and amazon are cheating the people...

I bought it in exchange with my old phone at 13,748/- (6+128). Exchange pick up was hassle free by amazon. I have been using this phone from last 4 days. The color opal black is beautiful. Phone is running smoothly. Camera is not up to the mark but not bad also,doesn't have that artificial whitening filter. You can see the real you in your photos. Slow motion video feature is simply great. Screen is big enough to use it to read a kindle book happily. Brightness of the screen is still bright even at the lowest, I am facing problem because I have eye problems. Battery doesn't feel like it is a 6000 mah battery. I charged it twice a day even after it got fully charged every time. It has 6000 mah capacity only if you full charge it and keep it on table. I brought back case and screen guard extra,which leads the price to 13,948/-. Phone comes with charger and ejection tool,it would have been good if they provide the case at least. Overall it is a good low budgeted phone. I liked it. Will upload a review again after a month using it.

This is an amazing phone at the cost it is being sold. Performance is amazing and I can really not think of any cons, if any at all, that is overweighed by the cost of the phone.

Battery though is of 6000Mah, It lasts only for a day on moderate use. The Battery performance can definitely be improved.

Plastic back is a little issue, but itne paise me itnaich milega..

Camera is awesome, it got all modes except Macro ;-) If we get this somehow.. It will be amazing.

One last, the size of charger cable is not upto the mark.

But, like i mentioned, Itne Paise Mein Itnaich Milega :-)

This is a good mobile for day to day use....But though it has all the features,  some are not as fast as expected,  Here are few details,
Display- Its a super amoled display, so can't compare with any other mobiles in this price segment,
Battery- Its 6000mah, but its almost equivalent to 4000 to 5000 of other brands, can't make out the difference,
Rest all features are average,  Camera, touch response, overall mobile speed, fingerprint sensor speed are ok ok...not that best ,but are sufficient for daily life.
Build quality is below average.
Processor- Its not for gamers ,can manage day to day tasks...compared to snapdragon 675 its slower one...
UI - One UI is new one , its different one and has really good features,  for people who want a change from the  Mi UI from MI phones can opt for this as a change....

Got delivery in time.Have been using it for well over two months
Points in favour
1. Sleek phone good looks
2. Capacitive screen is very responsive with no lag
3. Audio quality is clear
4. HD video quality good with reproduction of natural colors
5. Main camera is has high resolution. Image does not blur even after zooming
6. Camera works well in night mode
7. In  bright daylight screen is readable

Points  against
1. 6000 Milliamp battery drains out fast &amp; does not live up to monster reputation.Have observed it drain out with no use in 3 days
2. Battery charging is slow &amp;takes at least 2 hrs
3. Xynos 9611 power consumption is high.Mobile heats up with continuous use or when tethered for internet. Battery drainage can be reduced by setting device care
4. Mobile is slightly heavy
Overall a good phone for normal use not for heavy use. One can try out vivo z1 or MI A3 as an alternative
Have attached photos taken with night mode &amp; without night mode

I would like to tell you Prons and cons of mobile,
Prons:
1. Camera pucture quality is good.
2. Battery Backup is very good.
3. Energy consumption by phone is also very well managed.
4. Inbuilt antivirus for phone.
5. Good look but not that much impressive.

Cons:
1. 48 MP camera taking more than 30 seconds to save picture and ready for next picture. So more chances to have shaken picture.
2. Software is too poor it's not designed to have a easy graphical user interface, that you can find while saving your first contact to phone. You can't copy OTP from notification, you have to open it.
3. Its ultimate "SLOW". Yes it's slow, even though it says its having 2.3 Ghz processor but believe me, I have used Galaxy phone earlier also and the same problem I faced there are still exist. I have used a very low cost phone like Redmi 7 which cost is around 5999 on flipkart and having 2 GB ram and 32 GB  memory is having good performance than this phone.
4. Most irrited and worst part is customer care of samsung. They are not their to resolve our problem but to irritate us with their replays.
5. It comes with many un wanted applications  that you can't un install.
6. When I conveyed my problem about camera, they simply blamed their failure on third party apps which are also comes from them.

My experience using this phone for 2 months now:

1. Great Amoled screen with water drop notch.
2. Never lag during daily usage or while playing game. Even though I have over 250 apps installed and many of them running in background.
3. Rear Camera is good but not great. Other similar price range phone has better camera.
3.5. Front camera is average in good light but worst in lowlight.
4. Large battery last 2 days on normal usage. It also fast quickly within 2-3 hrs to 100%.
5. Finger print is fast. No issue.
6. Sound is good. Not best though. Good thing is 3.5mm jack is there.
7. USB type-C charger and fast charging.
8. Not too heavy or large to hold.

Best phone from Samsung in this price range.

Note: It 48MP mode is a separate option. You have to switch to it to capture in 48MP and it restrict you to 3:4 resolution. It take too much time (have to hold it in that position for more than 5 sec) for camera to click picture. So you will rarely use it.

Value for 💰. I got it at Rs11900 using HDFC card 10%+5%extra using smart buy.
Now Directly to the point.
Pros:
1 Long battery
2 Clean User Interface and highly
  customizable too.
3 Fast face unlock, even faster than its
  dedicated fingerprint sensor.
4 screen quality is unmatched.
5 Gaming performance above average.
6 Audio output through headphone jack is excellent courtesy ( dolby atmos support).
Cons:
1 cheap built quality.
2 not so good camera when compared to
  mi a3.
3 bug in fingerprint sensor as if you put it
  for long and then use fingerprint it
  doesn't unlocks at once , it takes another
  try to unlock.
4 Audio loudness through speaker is ok but
  quality is not that good.
Overall by my experience none of the con is deal breaker for medium user hence you can consider it in this price range.

1. Battery life is not as good as 6000 mah. It just runs full day. Battery drains fast as compared to my other phone.
2. Cracking noise coming on both sides, I believe it's a built problem.
3. Too much heating after 45 minutes to 1 hour call.
4. Being a new model, it's not as fast as other phones in this price range. Exynos 9611 is not good as Snapdragon 710.
5. While using multiple apps, it hangs a little.

This phone is truly a battery beast.
If you want to gift this phone to your parents like i did. Then this is the Best phone you can gift.
I bought this device after alot of research and shortlisted 3 best selling mobile but this phone fullfilled all my requirements.
This phone has everything which we use in our daily lives. Like FM radio. Call recording. Gaming mode. Faster cooling.
I've been a fanboy of Samsung since quite a long time and the innovation and specs that they are providing with the price is totally worth.
I don't have any problem with this device.
Things which i liked the most-
1. Beast Battery
2. Camera performance
3. Super steady video mode
4. Software experience
5. Fast charging (18W fast charging)
6. Display and also always on display like flagship phones
7. Fingerprint reader is decently fast
8. Dedicated SD card slot which not many brands provide
9. Gaming mode
10. No lag at all in HDR settings with ultra graphics in PUBG. And cooling mode gets activated automatically to cool the device.

Things which i don't like-
1. Build quality could have been better. It feels a little plasticy but its totally fine as you are gonna have a cover or case on it almost everytime.
2. Samsung should have included earphones in the box.
3. Back is prone to scratches so you have to laminate it or something.
That's all.

I'm quite satisfied with battery life. Even the performance is also nice but the worst feature of this phone is CAMERA. Despite of having 48MP triple camera the image quality is not up the mark and on zooming the deatils are also missing. 48MP samsung senor can't compete with sony impx363 sensor (used in iPhone 5)  &amp; I can't say anything about selfie camera because 'Worst worst worst' as the photos are really really soft. It could be better if there were no selfie camera. At last 48MP camera is a biggest MYTH about this phone.

This is a very good mobile phone in price slab under ₹14000/- . Battery life is excellent good for two days use without any interruption. Smooth and fine navigation through crispy touch. Veey Good display screen. I am using with 10% brightness and feeling comfortable. Fully satisfied with its captive screen which is very much light sensitive. You can enjoy movies as Dolby sound provide effect like cinema hall.
It's figure print and face recognition is so quick. Voice clarity and loudness is very good.
After 12 days use I can confirm the camera quality is also good. But you need to spent some time to explore it's camera settings. Afterwords you shall be abled to click quality pics.
Besides that Amazon make us fool as providing cash back in the form of unlock offers. Because I never use the flights, so I will not unlock this option or purchase an air ticket. This is not a genuine practice of marketing of amazon card.

As usual Samsung did it's job to made customers satisfaction by manufacturing M30s mobile to fulfill their needs.....

Coming to the performance of the mobile
M30s mobile battery backup is good but not as much as 6000mah battery...camera quality is very poor by using this phone no one believe it's camera is 48mpxl...
Operation of the phone is good...but external design of the phone is too bad...by look it's appears as old model/assembled/refurbished model.

This phone is feels awesome. I don't have words to describe how much I am loving it.

#1) Battery- This 6000Mah monster is giving me 2.5 days in a single recharge.
I used 6 hours Youtube in that and 3 hours jiocinema and surfing. 👌
#2) Display- This is 1st time I am using Samoled display it's colors are so natural if you compare normal IPS screen side by side you will notice difference. Plus good with sunlight.😊
#3)Camera- It's totally good camera even in low light it performs best.👍
#4) Fingerprint- It's works very fast and face unlocking is also very fast.🙌
#5) Processor- I don't play PUBG so I don't know about that but everything works fine and fast no lag at all.🔥
#6) UI - It's awesome guys One UI is awesome it's comparable to One plus UI. No adds at all.⭐
#7) Speaker- It's voice is good at low and high pitches. Well many of you don't know it also supports Dolby Atmos in headphones.👂

I will totally recommend this phone to others bcoz it's value for money.💪

First of all, this mobile is over rated. Expectation was high.

Screen and display is awesome. Real pleasure at this price.

Mobile software works smooth and no hang till now (since 2 months).

Battery back up is fair enough you can use for at least 2 days with day 2 day normal usage (I don't play games, will use to see post of social media).

Finger print sensor is of less sensitivity. It sometimes take 2 to 3 try.

Camera, they say 48MP, but the color and brightness of the real picture captured are not attractive, although you can apply filters to improve image clarity.

Overall it is a descent phone for decent price. I expect more updates for camera app to improve clarity.

Camera quality is very poor and also battery performance.... Slow charging process... This device heats very much... Amazon providing worst services at the time of return of products. I tried 25th October but still 2nd November they daily cancelled my pickup request and mention the reason that customers hand cancelled.

Ordered on 29th Sept 2019 and got it on 1st October 2019 with free two day delivery (despite not being prime member). Along with that, got 10% instant discount ie. 1400 and 1000 cashbacks as Amazon pay balance. Instead of 14000, I got this phone for 11600 !! Amazon couldn't have done better 😁😁😁

Now coming to this phone.. Well, this is the best phone in the 13-15K price segment and for good reasons:

Pros:

1)6000mAh battery: Indeed a monster. No phone, flagship or budget, comes with a 6000mAh battery as of now. The only thing that has more capacity than this phone as of  now is a POWER BANK.

2)sAMOLED screen: If you're using a branded smartphone except apple, it's screen has been probably made by Samsung. However, Samsung keeps the best for itself and you will see that in M30s. You will get true AMOLED experience in it - super bright and super sharp. The dark mode takes the experience to a different level.

3)Speed: Due to UFS 2.1 and Exynos 9611, you will get fairly good speeds.

4) 48MP camera: The triple rear camera works very well in good lighting conditions. The colors produced  look natural, not over saturated which you see in other brands.

5) Build quality: By just looking at the phone and even holding it, no one can ever imagine that there is a 6000mAh battery just under the case. The phone is very slim, just like it's competitors realme or A3. It's weight is also very less, doesn't let you feel that you are holding a phone with a 6000mAh battery. The back is made of plastic but it's not glossy. So your fingerprints and other smudges are not easily visible to spoil it's look.

6) Brand: You get a quality product from a brand like Samsung and that too in a Oppo Vivo Xiomi price range. And you won't have to worry about after-sales service either.

Cons:

1) Charging speed: This phone has a massive battery but it comes with just 15W charger. Even though it's a fast charger, but charging the battery to full takes almost 2.5hrs.

2) Gaming: For light to medium gaming, this phone is more than enough. But for heavy gaming, it is not suitable. For eg. unlike any phone in the segment, this one gives HDR+Ultra option in Pubg (for marketing purpose). It will run good in this mode for 20-30mins but after that, you will notice frame drops due to thermal throttling.

3) Front camera: Selfie camera is a big disappointment. It's a 16MP lens but only on paper. In real, it looks like a 5mp 😭 Nowadays, phones are competing for camera but Samsung, whose camera is compared with Pixel and Apple and other flagships, chose to stay out of it. A big let down for users. No point in talking about low light photography because it's foolish to expect it from budget/mid-range phones.

4) Updates: Not a con but a concern. Motorola stopped giving updates (not even an Android upgrade) in it's budget E-series phones just after 3-4 months of launch. Despite having stock Android, my E-4 plus didn't even get an Oreo upgrade. It's stuck with 7.1 since purchase date. Hope Samsung doesn't do that.

I didn't say anything regarding looks of this phone. As they say, "beauty is subjective". However, you you want a quiet presence, you will be happy with the looks of this phone.

To summarize,
If your expectations were very high for this price range, you should go with other brands.
If your expectations were low, then this phone will surprise you.
If your expectations were reasonable, then you will be happy with the deal.

Initially I got an opened box , so I claimed for replacement,  then I got newly unboxed pack but the phone has some problems initially like I couldn't able to update , if I click on update its saying invalid file , I couldn't able to open normal default messaging app , always app got crashed . Then I restarted,  soft reset , hard reset . Nothing works out . Then I visit samsung care and handover the phone to them,  they flash firmware and update the software . All these things really disappointed me a lot .

Anyway positive side of phone is

Excellent display
Excellent battery life
Fast face unlock even at dark areas
Good finger scanner
Good cameras ( I mean rear camera )
Good physical appearance
Radiation level is too low ( not like Chinese craps )

Cons
Average front camera .
Sound little bit low .
Plastic rear panel

With exchange and discount offer I got it at rs 9000 during festival sale. But I felt it's not worth of that amount also.

Pros :
Good battery life
Display is nice

Cons : It lacks many feature which Mi or other brand have.
Camera quality is worst it's not even 5mp, pictures get blurred even if you zoom little.
Battery life is good , it takes more than 3 hours to charge phone. So fast charger is of no use.

The phone is amazing it has a very good display and processor and all the other features are great at this price. The only downside I saw is -

BATTERY LIFE
Don't get me wrong the battery life is amazing but considering that it has a 6000 mAh battery I was expecting around 2 day battery life instead it reaches from 100% - 20% in around 23 hours.

So it will last 1 whole day with just a single charge even if you are a heavy user. And it's fine for me as I charge the phone every night 2 hours before I go to sleep.  As it has a fast charger it charges up in 2 hours.

CAMERA -
Nowadays it has become a trend of having a 48 megapixel camera in a smartphone and it will takes pretty amazing shots and was expecting the same with this phone also but was a little disappointing as it didn't had the quality that I thought it would have.
But for general use it is a great camera and the features you get along with the camera is also pretty amazing (slow motion, night mode etc).
Just doesn't have that quality when compared to the other competition in the market.

In conclusion the phone is amazing at its price point and I can easily recommend it to someone else also unless you are a pro photographer or going to use this phone for photography purpose

Overall Phone is really good and more than worth its price. Some of the features are really awesome. Battery life is amazing gives me more than a day on a full charge and with all day usage. Its finger print reader takes time to react so that is one negative. Another thing is if you will click pictures in 48MP mode than it takes I guess 20-30 seconds to save the picture and sometimes you get error also in this mode.

That's why I am rating it 4. Samsung has tried its best with this phone to put up a fight in budget phones section.
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars
-----
There is quite a competition in budget segment with 100s of smartphone models available at disbursal in likes of Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Motorola etc.

Previously I have owned Asus Max Pro M2, Motorola G4 Plus, Lenovo K6 which all belong to 13k-15k price band. I never liked Samsung earlier due to its launcher and bloatwares in earlier phones.

But recently Samsung has made a huge come back with A series and M series phones.  Why go for flagships when you get a near similar experience in price band that you can always afford!!!  Samsung is back with a bang to replace its lost glory to other Chinese manufacturers

Galaxy M30s met all the parameters I always looked into a smartphone namely
1. Latest version of Android
2. Full HD screen
3. Huge battery
4. Better RAM and battery management
5. Great storage space
6. No/Very less bloatwares
7. Lightweight
8. Better camera
9. Least SAR value

I would like to give gist of each of the above

1. Ships with Android 9.0 out of the box unlike M20/M30 that has Android 8.1
2. Has Full HD sAMOLED screen.  What can ask more for at this price range.  It has much better saturation and natural colors, legibility under direct sunlight
3. Battery.  6000 MaH!!! Nothing like it I have seen till date.  First in segment. First by Samsung.  You can easily scale it up upto 2 days with normal usage.  For power users, you can still see battery at 20% after one and a half day's usage.  When used in power saver mode, I got to use this mobile upto 3 days with moderate usage
4. On RAM management, it automatically adapts to app usage and kills unnecessary apps.  This reduces lag considerably.
5. Bloatwares are very less and quite a few like snapchat, helo etc. can be uninstalled.  You can disable others to avoid them getting udpated.
7. Even with 6000 Mah of battery, phone does not weight like a brick.  Rather weight balance is quite awesome and you dont feel it. At 188 gms, it is at par with its peers with lesser batteries. The phone surface is not slippery
8.  At 48 MP, samsung has delivered a better camera. During tests I conducted, daylight photos came good however, night shots struggled with some noise. I guess this can be fixed in future OTA updates
9.  Lesser SAR value.  I am specific to SAR values when I purchase phones.  Thats where I stopped using MI and never like One plus brand.

Overall, The King is back to reclaim its throne!!!

It's been a week of using the product and so far I am impressed with this device except the front camera.
Bought @11600. For this price, I find this device to be an excellent product.

Background and type of usage: Not a heavy gamer, do not play PUBG and all heavy titles. Use phone for internet browsing, mails and youtube and occassional photography. Also I was a Moto fanboy and switched from G5s plus to this device.

To keep everything short and based on the price I bought this device
Build - 3.5/5
Design - 4/5
In-hand feel - 4.5/5
Display - 5/5
Touch responses - 4.5/5
Fingerprint - 4/5
Face Unlock - 3.5/5
UI experience - 4.5/5
RAM management - 4.5/5
Storage - 6/5 (Extra 1 for providing dedicated Micro-SD card slot)
Bottom speaker sound quality - 4/5
Network reception - 4/5
Call quality - 4.5/5
Earpiece sound quality - 4.5/5
Rear camera photos - 4.5/5
Rear Camera videos - 4/5(Night mode needs improvements)
Front camera photos - 3/5
Front camera videos - 2.5/5
Battery - 6/5(No comments here. Hands-down the best in this price range)

What I liked
1. Battery -&gt; Gives almost 2 days of back-up on my type of usage. Kept device on stand-by for 4 days, battery percentage is now 72%. Fast charger is also provided in box.
2. Crisp and punchy display. Change display settings to Vivid if not done yet.
3. Lag-free experience on day-to-day multitasking
4. Good set of rear cameras. Takes good photos in low light also.

What I didn't like
1. Build quality-&gt; Could have been built better if SS used a little more sturdy Polycarbonate material.
2. Front camera-&gt; Need lots of improvements in maintaining details. Photos lack sharpness on so many levels. Over-smoothening of skin-tones is observed in capturing photos. I hope SS fix the camera issues with software updates in near future.

Overall it's a very good device and like always no product is perfect.

Even though having a larger screen and aspect ratio with a much bigger battery capacity than any other ones in this range(Best-in-class), it still feels so light and easy to use single-handedly that i do some heavy gaming (MC5, CODM) for like 4-5 hrs. continuously (with smooth performance) and still it got some good battery backup for some other stuffs too. And at this genuine and affordable price with these great features in a smartphone no one could better it for now(as other ones in this very range are either 4+32,4+64 or 6+64 configured) but this smartphone is perfectly configured(i.e.,4+64 or 6+128) as for a greater RAM, comes a greater storage capacity like in premium smartphones. Also to mention that it has a better, easy and relevant UI experience with a good slo-mo, super slo-mo and ultra wide camera features, and many customizations available for one's relevancy in UI. Fingerprint Unlock is quite good and the phone's build is quite good too (as since i got it in my hands, i might have slipped it once or twice and still it doesn't get any dent on the body or any scratches/cracks on the screen even though it was without any screen protection). Overall no other phone can better this one at this very available range for now with some high-end premium performance features at an affordable and genuine price deal.
Once again Samsung India has launched a breakthrough smartphone series in mid-range smartphone competition and the best thing is that it is a Made In India product which is making a Buzz.
Thank you @ amazon.in and Samsung India for launching a great mid-range and high-end performance smartphone at this amazing price with premium features.
Overall the conclusion is that if you are willing to buy a smartphone for miscellaneous heavy-use with high-end premium performance features at an affordable and genuine price, this one is a great deal for you.
A must (cuz it worth its price every pie)!!

Really this device made for a person who wants his phone last for long. I am using it for a month now. And trust me this is really a awesome device. Battery last for up-to 2 days on heavy use. Samsung later UI i.e. ONE UI is perfect. optimization is better than anyone else OS.
For Gaming, i tried to play most trending games all are running smoothly.
And weight distribution you will be use too in 1-2 days. It doesn't feel heavy in hands.
You can go for it. :)

Cant see much special of Pros, it has mostly common feature like every another android phone.

Cons:

1. Very short and low quality charging cable. Feel like local street market stuff.
2. Camera details are very bad even in normal modes and day light. When zoomed, Its pixels start breaking a lot.
3. Performance not upto mark, it doesn't lag but its not that fast as expected.
4. As per battery capacity charger is very slow, even after its Fast charging.

I am disappointed with Samsung and this device. They could have done better.

my new m30s i has 3 days batter after full charge.After one month of usage, and installing many apps, the battery is for 1day -24 hours to 30 hours after a single charge, with data ON.I am on dual sim with data ON. Using internet and telephone moderately. The battery is exceptional outstanding!!!. I bought a opal black. The phone is a pleasure to hold in hand, slim and STURDY. A Royal finesse. The DISPLAY is a marvel. It's a treat to eyes. It feels as if we are turning pages on a oil printed book. What a flawless display!!!! The night mode and color inversion are simply fantastic. Night mode works with Samsung internet app also and not with chrome. Very easy and appealing to eyes.The phone display can be larger. It doesn't feel like 6.4 inch. The finger print sensor is on the back and i love it. I dont like display finger print phones. Back finger sensor in m30s is awesome. We have option to turn off all the background apps in the settings which can stop all the irritative app notifications and apps running in the background. User friendly.
The camera was bad when I tried taking pictures on my new phone. Low light didnt work at all. I don't know how, in a few days, the low light worked marvellously. A little wide angle. The company has a default 16MP rear camera which can be adjusted to 48MP. Wide but not deep. The camera has good color, but lacks clarity or precision.  See the samples i have posted. Very good. The sound is Dolby atoms and clear. The ringer is loud enough. The phone does not come with earphones, no temper glass or back case. Simply the phone and charger is in the pack. We need to buy them 3 extra. I got a samsung level U along with it and it works awesome too.

All features meets expectations except two things.
1) Video call quality (from both front &amp; back camera) is down to earth(just like VGA camera/2 mega pixel even if using back camera of 48 mega pixel its gives 2 mega pixel quality) while using in built calling app. Whereas video call quality through what's up calling is better than in built.
2) Finger print sensor is not up to the mark, takes little bit more time than other compatible brands. Also built quality surrounding finger print sensor is very poor.( sharpen edges surrounded by fingerprint sensor must have or cover by fingerprint sensor but it's on upside of sensor which may create small cuts on finger while moving finger for unlock phone through fingerprint sensor. I have replaced my phone due to it but  in new phone having same issue. It's like manufacturing defect in almost all M30S.
But it's not impact its overall performance.
If u don't care for this two issues, it's a best phone which I recommend to buy within this best price range.

Overall Camera performance is poor at this price segment ,little more expected from Samsung.Coming  to the fingerprint sensor, it's not up to the mark, battery performance is very impressive, smoothly takes almost 1.5days,it should support atleast 22watt fast charger inbox sothatcharging could be reduced.Exynos9611 with One UI from Samsung gives a new experience,day today activities and gaming there is no lagging issue till now.Customizition is userfriendly.Nothing much about the SuperAmoled display,it's nice as usual.Glass finishing would make the phone more immersive and premium feel.One important note, TPU case should be included with in the box,Charging cable length should be at least 1.5meters. Overall in the budget segment it can be an awesome choice along with some bank discounts

I'm writing this review when the battery is 1% remaining.
It's 3rd day I'm using this phone.
Fingerprint  reader is very quick.
Camera quality obviously it's not a DSLR so in such a price you shouldn't expect very much.
Battery life I used yesterday from 100-0% of battery I used for 1 day and 4 hours means 28 hours and 9 hours and 10 minutes screen on time for a normal to moderate use.
I don't play games so haven't tested it.

Most important thing is phone looks premium.
and
Korean company is better than any chinese company.
That's it.

Amazon packing  0 stars for very poor packing.
Value for money product .
Charging issues may occur due to network  fluctuations.
but you can get 10 hrs screen on time for 6000 mah battery .
Display quality is superb can watch movies with high qualities.
Storage options are managed very nicely...
They are giving storage option for downloads to sd card or whatsapp etc to sd card directly.

I loved this phone , This could be more better but it's best in this price .
If you've budget then go for it.

I hope some bugs will be fixed in the next major update.

[Update after 19 Days of use.]

Battery is best giving about 11-12 hours screen on time.
Night mode helps alot.
Front camera should be a little bit good.
But Value for money at this price.
Rear camera does not meet 48 mp camera but a good one.
Dolby atmos is good for music.

Camera is Hopeless 48 MP is not a number.
Samsung J7Pro of 13MP is far better that this camera.
Battery is 6000mAH but in Actual it lasts only 1 day on normal use.
Built Quality is very poor, Plastic or fibre used makes side bezel noise after pressing the mobile sides.
Sim Not allowed message for both sim slot was observed.
Don't buy if you are planning or thinking to buy this.

Review of #GalaxyM30s after 7 days of intense usage. (4GB ram / 64 GB)

Pros :-

1. Super Amolate display - Frankly speaking the display is very good &amp; it is literally spoiling me.
2. User Interface - Its very simple and easy, far better than the Color OS in Realme / Vivo.
3. Battery Backup - There is no competition available in the market in terms of battery life. Excellent!
4. RAM Management - Pretty Good (I ain't a hardcore gamer, so it might be different for others) but for me as an everyday rigorous user its pretty good.
5. Cellular Network - I have used 3 Sim card (JIO, Vodafone &amp; Airtel) and all 3 of them worked perfectly.
6. Sound Quality - Very good and with headphones it's even better because of Dolby Atmos.
7. Processor - Its pretty good and the phone didn't lag a bit (till dated) and nor was there any heating issue.
8. Fingerprint Scanner - It takes roughly 4-5 second to unlock or even less.

Cons -

1. Camera - you will be disappointed if you are highly optimistic about the camera of the phone.
The Color saturation of the back camera if good and looks clean but as soon as you zoom in it divides into grains.
Coming back to the front camera, it's not good. It kind of gives a artificial soft skin (which I didn't like personally).
The portrait and panorama mode are decent.
Overall the camera is AVERAGE, not the best.
2. In box accessories - In the box you won't be getting a headphone or a back cover or a screen protector.

Everything about this phone is excellent. Except camera as it claimed 48 MP camera. Quality is not up to mark. Also when I take selfie, It makes my skin too fair which I am not. If they can improve  this thing it will be a superb phone. Also it has a problem with face detection lock. If I am sleeping my eyelids are closed then also its get unlocked. It's a serious security issue. Processor is very good. Even the display quality is amazing. Charger wire is bit shorter than expected. This review I am giving after using it for a month. I got this phone for 14k (6GB ram +128GB) in launching day.

Talking about the design its absolutely beautiful. It feels so premium in hand. Quite convenient to use as well. It does not feel bulky. 5 stars for design.

Now coming to the battery. For a battery of 6000 MAH, It's quite lite actually. The battery life is also quite good. It will simply last for more than two days in a single charge. I have tested it, thumps up for battery life. 5 stars again.
Now coming to the display. Wow gorgeous,  absolutely stunning. Bessels are there but still it's not bulky. Bottom end is a little bulky. But it's just fine. Overall color is great. It has a vivid mode in display settings through which you can just boost the colors like hell. Thumps up again for display. 5 stars again.

Now coming to the camera. Well I would say, It's good. Day light photography is absolutely beautifuly. Dynamic range is good. Color reproduction is also quite good. In our door condition it performs great.
But in in door conditions it struggles a little bit. Overall picture quality reduces. And when it comes to night or low light condition again the same. Camera struggles in night condition. A dedicated night mode is there, but still its compromises with the clarity.  Details are not up to the mark. For the Primary 48 MP over all I would give a 4 star. It's just because of its lack of performance in night or low light conditions.
The wide angle 8 MP is quite wide. Its captures more compared to the other phones with wide angle lenses in this price segment.
Now about selfies. Well out door conditions it's quite good. Gives out decent images with decent details. But night time again it struggles.  So for selfies I would give  3 stars.
Now in case of performance it's quite good. Games run smoothly ,no lags so far. It has a dedicated game optimiser settings which is good. Performance is snappy and awesome.  Thumps up for that as well again 5 stars.

Over all I would say it's a great device. For this price range Samsung has definitely given a stunning device. I will recommend it, except for the selfi part especially in low light conditions. Other wise it's a gorgeous piece of equipment. Hope Samsung will give us some software updates for improving the camera performance. Because its hardware is much more capable for sure.I would like to give 4.5 stars overall but there is no option that why I'm giving 4. I hope this will be helpfull to a lot. Thanks

Pros:
- worth the money. You cannot get branded phones with these many features for 17k
- battery life is really good. I am an average user (neither play games nor keeps data on always, but uses hotspot quite often) and this lasts for minimum 1 day 5  hours if fully charged.
- phone looks good, slim and light weight
- sAMOLED display gives good clarity

Cons:
- I am using this phone since 2 months. Since last week, the finger print sensor is not very effective as how i was before.
- Back camera quality is good. But the front camera pics quality is poor in low lights. Expecting Samsung to roll-out updates, addressing this issue.
- Inbuilt data speed indication is not available. Need to install 3rd party app for this purpose. This is quite upsetting.
- the phone body color combinations are not so impressive. could be better

Bottom line:
- Despite few cons, you can buy this phone as its worth the money.

Best phone of the millennium. I wiated all my life for a phone with AMOLED screen, good battery, good processor, good camera and good looks. My wait ended here where all my expectations were not only met but I got everything better. Pros and cons
Pros
 battery life: Better than expected. I am a kind of heavy user with daily 7 to 8 hrs screen ontime. No phone till today matched upto my expectations. This phone lasts for 1 and a half day. I charge it 100 pc and go to office which is 20 mins away with bluetooth on and music playing. When I reach office the battery is still 100 pc. For moderate user battery would last more than 48 hrs.

Screen: Screen is better than all other brands I have used (I have used many flagships). Watching movies and youtube is a bliss.

Camera : works like my DSLR in night mode. But is very slow in normal mode. Clicking consecutively is difficultand takes 1 sec sometimes 2 sec to ready the camera after one shot. Maybe some settings isses which I have not figured out yet. Video quality is excellent. 4K video can be recorded. Excellent image stabilisation

Processer speed: Unmatched speed. No lagging. Opens apps without difficulty. Could not believe my eyes how quickly it boots and opens apps.

Fingerprint and face unlock is far better than Samsung's flagships. When ever I hold the phone and bring close to my face phone is unlocked and homescreen appears within no noticeable time. Works like magic

Overall best phone till date for which I waited all my life

Likes : display is better than any other phone in this segment
Ram management is better, so no worries switching between apps
Video stability is also awesome

Cons : Camera images not so clear, even in full HD. Edges get blurred. Front camera pics are not so clear, just normal and not so sharp.
Camera focus is very slow. Very Disappointing.
There is app for game management but when I played pubg, it was lagging and there  were frame drops.

Rest all the features are similar to same segment phones.
Suggestion : go for 4+64 or 4+128 version as it is cheaper and no other phones in that segment, not 6+128.

The battery life is extremely good. The phone works for atleast 60 hours once it is fully charged. The fingerprint reader is very smart and recognizes the finger print very quickly. The camera quality is very good as it let's you takes pictures in different modes with different options of changing focus. The back camera is protected with an outer layer of covering over it. This outer covering over camera is an added feature which is not present in most of the contemporary phones of other brands.

Complete budget phone, with all desired features in this segment
1. Camera is useless and poor quality, night mode is extremely bad. Not expected that much bad quality.
2. Battery is good but not great, as expected/advertised for 6000 mAH.
3. Good phone to use with Samsung 1UI
4. Display is amazing with FHD video quality
6. Speaker quality is not so good.
7. Call quality is also not good compared to older brands of Samsung.
8. Processor Good but not great.
9. Over all it's "The good deal" in this price segment to get a good battery phone only.
Samsung need to improve a lot in camera part of phones, rests are ok and acceptable.
I sold out the phone after using for 4 mo the only.

<div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R2G9ZBM3L75351"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91oXR1JQlkS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ZuGwI9ArS.png"/> I didn't expect this much cheating from amazon. Given that 48+8+5 Megapixel camera, not giving even 5M or 10-megapixel camera quality. It could have shown at least 25-megapixel quality. The selfie camera (16megapixel) very much disappointed, too bad. see the attached photo and video. The photo was taken from nearer to laptop screen with live focus. The text on the laptop screen is not resolved with 48 megapixels!!!. And about the video, the green tree looks grey in color!!!!
After replacement recieved a defective product with scratches. wasting our valuable time.
I contacted Amazon customer care people. They didn't respond with this issue and they are not allowing to return the phone. They kept a replacement policy. Behind this policy, they are selling very low-quality product advertising with wrong product information.
This is not a single case, the same thing happened for my friend too, when he purchased a Samsung printer. During the guarantee period when the product was found defective, they were not ready to replace the item.
this phone 6000mAh battery looks like 5000mAH. The display is fine and good.
Since camera quality below 20 percent of the advertised quality, I am giving an overall 1 star only.
I have lost trust in Amazon and never purchase any items in the future.

I liked most things in this phone is it's battery. You can use it without seeing corner percentage of battery for full day.

However finger Recognition is not prove much powerful as per my concern. BCoz it's can't recognise my 5 years son's fingerprint which Lenovo can do very well.

Camera is good but not expected as 48 megapixel, its also useless in wide angle mode, BCoz photo looks like as it made in Photoshop.
But night mode of camera is much better than other.

Facelock is also good and powerful. But i disable it BCoz whenever you take a mobile in your hand, its work automatically and Either your mobile will unlock or its show face can't recognise.

One can go for it if he thinks like me that it's better to spend 2k more if we get Samsung instead of China.

Let's start with Cons first
1.Front Camera is the only major con for me.Photos come out very soft and misses sharpness totally.
2.Speaker is a big minus for me,lacks quality audio and bass.
 Overall the two cons are big drawbacks but there are so many cons that you can completely forgive it.Lets check out the Pros
1.Superb Display,with FullHD Super Amoled Screen,I bet this display is the best in its Category.
2.Camera : Rear Camera works seriously good,Live &amp; Ultra Wide modes are the best and works excellent in the day time indoor/outdoor.
3.Storage : 128GB + SD slot is more than enough.
4.Ram : 6GB Ram works efficiently.
5.Battery : 6000mah ,muuuaahh!! Seriously guys with full battery charge in the morning 9am till 8pm in the night and with usuage including games,wifi,mails,excel,word ,etc i just lost 50% of charge and next day with 4G internet i lot 68% ,which is the best battery life i have ever seen.
6.Built Quality : Initially switching from metal body to plastic body on my new M30S i felt less happy but soon i got to understand that it grips very well into your hand,Phone is a bit on a thicker side but you never feel the weight which is enough to let go it.
7.PUBG : Works just perfect on this and once again the battery stays like unbelievable, after playing for 1 hour i jusy lost 8% from the intense gaming.Game performs well if considered under 17K.
8.Face Unlock and Fingerprint : FU works great in the day, but at night it dosent perform all that great.Fingerprint response is very fast.
9.Samsung UI : Only one word , BEST
10.Charger : It takes 0-100% charge in 150mins.

Great phone if you are not a 'gamer'.
I chose this over note 8 pro because:
.. note 8 pro does not have amoled
.. m30s has a 6000mAh battery
The plastic body did not matter as I put a case on all my phones . Yes, the redmi has a glass back, but that makes it more prone to cracks , so I would've put a case anyway, so essentially it didn't matter if it was plastic or glass.
Fingerprint reader is quick enough unless someone kills you for not opening your phone 0.05 seconds faster than the others. Tenths of a second don't matter people.
Camera is great, people who want professional quality should buy DSLR or mirrorless anyway. For general Instagram purposes:
..HDR is great
..supersteady mode on video is great.
..depth sensor works perfectly

Exynos 9611 great for everyday use, with the everyday use covering 2hrs of gaming. (Shouldn't game more anyway, shouldn't blame Samsung for trying to give us a life)
Call of duty works great (pubg is dying anyway)

I liked screen quality ,I watch movies a lot so I the screen ,and battery is super impressive it lasted about 1 1/2 days , I play games but I won't play pub g or call of duty ,I play games like wcc2 ,Leo's fortune sky force reloaded and it played them very well and I didn't face any lag in my day to day usage , camera is good I  won't take selfies mostly I use rare camera and it's fine in daylight conditions but it's performance is average in night times but it's fine with me ! One thing I didn't like about this mobile is it didn't get even December security patch update where as in Samsung A50 which my dad uses already has Jan security patch ,pls work fast on it ,and their is a rumour that m30s will get android 10  hope we will get it soon , thank you for this device at affordable price ,it looks good alteast in my point of view , even this device have 6000 mah battery it didn't feel heavy  , over all , excellent experience !  Thanks  ___ Chandra !!

I liked this phone very much. There will not be a better phone in this price range. Thanks a lot to Samsung and Amazon.com. Many thanks from the seller as well. Flexibility improved on phone's processor / RAM / Battery. It is running very fast. There is no problem in heavy game. Even after running a day, the battery remains up to 20%. it's awesome.

First of all the name monster is worth for the phone , battery life is really awesome.

The triple Camera setup performs really well, there are different modes available in the camera , you can shoot the video in super steady and super slow motion. Therefore , the overall rating for camera out of 5 is 4.5.

Now comes to the processor performance , the Samsung exynos 9611 performs really well , with very smooth multitasking experience. The gaming experience in m30s  is really amazing you can play pubg with high graphics and frame rate .
The phone gets little warm initially while you play game , however it maintains the balance after 15 minutes of game play and you will feel warm after that.

The m30s comes with super amoled screen that makes the experience of watching movies , videos and games really well, all the viewing angles are really great.

The design of the phone is also really great , and it is 188 gm with 6000mah battery inside it but will not feel bulky as samsung have maintained the balance very well.

The m30s comes with three colors as of now , white , black and blue . I Like the black color which have the greenish shade at the back side which makes smartphone really cool.

So , the overall experience from last 5days with m30s is really awesome till now.

It's a useless phone for 17000 supposed to be 6 GB ram, it's performance is like a 2 GB ram phone, battery does not even last 1/2 a day. Drains on its own, charging is very poor, even after whole night charging it's not 100% even though mobile is switched off. Comparatively my old MI note 4 with 4gb ram is very quick in accessing any page, battery lasts the whole with heavy usage. Don't buy unless Samsung sorts out these issues. I have idea as well Airtel sim cards, even in middle of town where MI shows full range, this mobile has just two lines coverage signal. Tried both sims at the same spot in another mobile, full power coverage signal. Looks like Samsung bought cheap phones in China and labelled them as I have J2 Samsung original bought in Dubai, it has fallen in bucket full of water, fallen off pocket on bike, screen broke but function is normal as day one. By selling this phone Samsung is giving its reputation a very bad name. I not but any more Samsung, Xiomi MI far better

Just Great....
Display 10/10 ( turn on vivid mode in display setting)
Battery 11/10( yes 11/10 see the attached screenshot)
Camera 9.5/10(turn on hdr to see the magic)
Use snapseed for dslr like photos
Software 10/10(much better than MIUI and Color Os)
Performance 9/10
Build Quality 9/10
Value for money 10/10 (4gb variant only)
Everything is great just the speed of finger print scanner can be improved a little bit through software update
Hope Samsung Fixes that.

Mine is sapphire blue 4gb 64gb for 11.5k

Friends after using and cheking feature  i came to point  that in this mobile  batery backup,display quality,sound quality, fingerprint scaner all are performing well but only negative things in this mobile is camera there is 48mp camera is given but it is not even performing  like 16 mp camera  which i used in moto g4+,clarity is missing pictures  is not so fresh after zooming . So if you are buying this mobile phhone for camera  then look for another mobile phone and if you are neglecting  camera then go for it...

Firstly, the Samoled display is is straight up flagship and its so good to look at and its one of the main unique features that beats other mid-range smartphones as all all phones now-a-days are starting to look alike. The RAM is of the latest technology and is very fast as advertised. The processor is one of the most perfect things about this phone. Its a latest 10nm chipset and its powerful and easy on the battery. The UI is crisp and fast and doesn't hang at all. The cameras are so good. Normally the rear camera shoots at 12MP who gives very good detail thanks to the 5MP depth sensor. You can take 48MP shots in good light conditions to zoom in to far away objects, other than that its not much use. The 8MP ultra-wide sensor shoots excellent 1080p videos and photos in good light but low light performance is not great. Its better to use primary camera at 12MP for pics in low light. The night mode is fine at this price point. But I recommend using the normal mode when taking close up shots of objects or portraits and night mode to take photos of buildings etc., The front 16 MP camera photos are good too with decent detail and also has live focus. I recommend removing the beautifying setting that comes on default as it softens the image and removes detail. The speakers have good loudness and quality. There's no need to talk about the battery. Even for a very heavy user like me, its kinda difficult to drain the battery and don't worry about fully charging the phone as 55% charge is enough for a day. The rear finger print sensor is very fast but you need to keep it clean as the glastic back attracts small fibers and is a finger print magnet. I recommend that when you buy the phone exchange it for your previous phone. Cause I bought the 6GB+128GB variant for 13,300 rupees and its feels like a steal. The phone is already a steal and I made even a better one.

Pros :-
1. Battery - Samsung M30s is surely one of those smartphone that won't be asking much of a charging. With full charge lasting more than 1 day usage
2. Camera - A very reliable camera for any kind of pictures and videos much better than its contemporaries (Redmi Note 8) within price range
3. Display - Very rich experience with all kinds of gaming and videos.
Cons :-
1. The device is not very much usable with just single hand.
2. Sometimes the response during call or fingerprint scanner is slow.

But I will suggest that it's pros overpower it's cons.
You won't regret buying this smartphone.

When it is Samsung you just rely on its product blindly. Camera, battery network as far I checked all are as per my expectations. If updates are being performed periodically then more improvements will be there. Just bank on SAMSUNG and post your reviews positive or negative it will serve the TOTAL COMMUNITY OF AMAZON. Thanks.

Samsung Galaxy M30S is the game changer.
Excellent features in low budget.
I am using it from 7 days and facing no issues.
Detailed review:
Battery: I am really happy with battery backup as it lasts up to approx 3 days with normal usage. Even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light.

Camera: Photos taken with the Samsung Galaxy M30s are decent, and look good on the phone's AMOLED display. Daylight shots had average details on zooming in. Night mode is good enough to capture good shots.

Touch, Look and Design is awesome.

The fingerprint sensor and the face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock.

The processing speed is good.

Overall, it is a value for money product.

Pros:
1. Looks-Phone looks good, very handy, easy to use and back glossy finish looks awesome
2. Performance- is good, PUBG runs well.
3. Sound- is good and loud.
4. Fingerprint works fast.
5. Face lock is also so fast.
6. Theme is also good as compare to other Samsung  models.
7. Battery- battery life is great as battery is high.

Cons:
1. Camera- is not good as it is 48 mp camera, photo quality  is not that good. But several features  like slow motion, portrait were great.
2. Charging- is slow, it takes 2-3hrs to fully  charged. So i don't think it supports fast charging.

Overall phone is great for gaming, battery life and looks.

Overall great phone and honestly it's a steal.
I was a Samsung phone hater(mid-range segments) and preferred mi and realme but now the tables have turned. Based on my 10 days usage these are the things I noted(4GB variant):-
1)Great Battery Backup (lasts almost  2 days in
  normal usage and more than one day with heavy
  usage).
2)The sAmoled display and the touch response is
  great.
3)The speaker is decent and there is no problem in
  Calling which I felt bad in redmi devices but their
  4g speed is greater  than this phone(100 to 200
  kbps difference only)not alarming maybe due to
  the snapdragon  processor(which is better than
  exynos in power efficiency and performance).
4)The exynos 9611 is snappy,fast won't say power
  efficient because I think if they would have put
  snapdragon processor then the battery would
  have lasted for 3 days straight.
  Day to day usage and multi tasking is good may
  be due to lpddr4 ram and ufs 2.1 storage.
5)Camera qualty is ok. Trust me 48mp is just for
  marketing  I can't  see any difference in normal
  12mp photos infact I liked 12 mp photos with
  hdr enabled and has more clarity  than 48 mp.
  The dynamic range is good.u won't get the
  sharpness mainted after zooming  the photos but
  kind of ok .wide angle camera also great but
  struggles in low light.Selfie camera is average and
  struggles in low light I felt decent only there is
  not much detailing that u could see in other
  devices like mi and realme in this segment.
  Infact I think it's ok because  it's main sensor and
  selfie sensor is wider than the camera's  used in
  other phones therefore there is a little blur at the
  sides of the focus point when u zoom the photos.
The camera app has many features  like slo-mo,I personally liked the ar face feature, night mode is crap.
Video recording is very good with eis,sound recording  is also good.
Overall  the camera is ok but if u want the best camera then go for apple ,oneplus and gcam fully enabled phones.
6)The samsung One UI is I perfect,elegant and snappy to use I used lean launcher to look more beautiful.
7)Design is good and in hand feel is also excellent.
8)Built quality is low because it dosen't have a gorilla glass protection and the back cover is very light that when I pressed the sides a clicking sound is produced but it's ok.I would highly  recommend a screen protector and  back case.
9)while keeping the camera app open the phone gets heated up a little and gets heated  on the top portion of the phone.But it was suprising  to see that the phone cools down very fast.

After reading  all this if ur still confused to buy this phone then wait till 2100😁 to buy the best phone at budget price.

Phone battery is not enough as a mentioned in the website 7% battery used when watched movie for 65 mins by headphone. means 20% percentage batter used when not using phone and Internet ON in just 4 hours. After updating the phone twice, the option of Torch is disable and torch is not working. Many times did complaint to Samsung Customer Care they given suggestion to contact Samsung Authorised Dealer. OTG is not supported also Samsung Customer Care they given suggestion kindly purchase the UTG only from Samsung Authorised Centre.

PROS
I liked almost everything about the product. It's battery is why people bought this phone which easily lasts for 1.5 day. Camera was not that good initially but after the update it got much better. The display is top notch in this handset. One of the best displays one can get at this price point. Touch is also super responsive. Memory management is at par with redmi phones but could have improved. The black color back looks stunning even with plastic use. Gaming is also supported in a better optimised way in M30s.

CONS
I switched from Redmi therefore I noticed a significant drop in Quality of Service in the network connection. With jio it still works fine but the moment we put another sim of airtel or voda the net speed drops or doesn't work. Other thing that I missed in this phone notification light which is standard feature in all redmi phones. IR blaster is also missed but not alot.

Cons:
1. Average Camera (autofocus dosent work properly when you try to focus nearby objects)
2. No Gcam App support
3. Dosent come with earphones
4. While scrolling of heavy apps( FB,Twitter,Insta etc), you can see the phone will have some hiccups

Pros:
1. Awsome Battery
2. Superb Display AMOLED (blacks are blacks)
3. 3.5mm Headphone Jack

Overall best phone only for those, who does lot of media consumption , and social media usage, and basic functions. Don't expect this phone to take extraordinary photo( that 48mp photo is you click , it takes hard 3-4 sec to get ready for another photo).

I have been using this smartphone for last 3 months.
Here are some of the list of positives and negatives from my experience.

Positives:
1. Amazing sAMOLED display (Watching videos are good on this phone)
2. Good Processor (Gets the daily multitasking done - don't expect too much gaming)
3. Amazing UI (Really liked the One UI it's intuitive and good)
4. Nice Camera (I am not a camera geek hence I canÂÂ’t comment much about the camera)
5. Samsung Brand ( It is always better to choose, branded phones considering the trustworthiness of these companies, Chinese brands will take all your data)

Negatives:
1. Worst GPS /Compass (If you use maps on your phone better stay away from this phone GPS sucks on this phone, I am really frustrated because of that)
2. Bloatware - Like any other mid-ranger You get some of the Samsung and Microsoft apps which you can't uninstall) (But you can force stop/disable some of these apps)
3. Plastic body - The body is made of plastic with not so exact fitting (The body is made from ordinary plastic and if you press along the left-hand side phone edge, you will feel that it’s not properly built, there are clicking sounds and a gap between the plastic body and the screen)
4. Color - The sapphire blue option on this phone is not good as it is very glossy same is the case with the black color option. Instead of blue, the company could have used green which is used on the sides for extra color (Use can always use a screen protector)
5. Battery life - The phones battery life is not that impressive as it is marketed, my 3000mah Moto G5 Plus used to last me 1 day in full charge, while this phone last me only 1.5 day (even after having twice the battery size)
6. Light sensor - The automatic brightness sensor is not that responsive and a couple of time you will have to adjust brightness manually
7. Fingerprint Sensors - The fingerprint sensor is of poor quality and is not well bonded with the plastic body. It is at times slow and has the plastic feeling to it
8. Loud Speaker - The Loudspeaker on this phone is just okay it could have been more loud
9. Updates - Being Samsung mid-ranger phone don't expect quicker updates on this device

I rarely write reviews but thought to post one for this simply because this phone offers almost exactly what it claims. I have been using this for 3 months now and it has been quite a rewarding experience.
Now on the features
Pros
Amazing battery life: if you use it moderately it will last up to 2 days, for very heavy users it will easily last a day. As I said it claims it has 6I mah battery and it proves its effectiveness. But yes even with fast charging this one takes quite sometime to charge
Performance: For this price, performance is quite good. For daily task without much of multitasking this phone doesn't hung up or lags but I guess for a game junky this device can disappoint although I have tested it
Display: Wow as Samsung does boasts of its displays this device has got a soothing, crystal clear, pixel perfect display
Call connectivity and caller sound: I did not faced much hiccup here although I needed to restart phone couple of time as my primary sim was not able to connect but it's a pass by issue
Value for money: This is really a value for money phone

Cons
Fingerprint sensor: This has one if the slowest sensor I guess amongst most in this category
Camera: Actually I wanted to put camera in both pros and cons since as I was coming across different reviews about dismal camera and all, I was not disappointed by the camera. This is capable of taking some good shots in average lighting too. And I don't know why people are saying it has slow focus, contrary to others opinion, I feel this one's focus is quite fast. I used mi a2 which was pathetic in focus category but yes it had great resolution and images looked very real but here images does lack the depth and clarity a bit. This one where Samsung claims of 48 pixel,  I really doubt what they mean by pixel here coz it can be 8 pixel but definitely not 48
Build quality: As the outer shell is made of plastic, it does not feel rugged at all and you can literally make dents in the sides. And also I guess because of the battery this phone is little heavy

On the whole for the price this phone is worth it and surely worth the hype

This product is a great buy at a reasonable price from Amazon. I got this product delivered with minimal waiting period.

Samsung is a known brand across in smartphone ranges and this model M30S has proven to be exceptionally better than the previous launches. I have reviewed this product based on my one month experience on the below criteria:

 Display: The display is amazing with an amazing pixel density thereby providing clear picture quality. The 91% aspect ratio provides a full use of the screen space.

Battery life: The box comes with a fast charging 15w and is truly living upto its name. The phone charges upto 100% within a span of two to three hours.  The 6000mAh  battery truly stands its potential by providing you a battery life lasting for approx 1.5 days ( I use my phone regularly). The phone doesn't heat up during charging / during use of heavy apps which is a rare quality in smartphones these days.

Processor &amp; Memory : With a 4GB RAM, 64gb memory space, I believe this phone is the quintessential requirement of every millenial. The time it takes in between switching apps is almost negligible and the touch screen is very responsive to the slightest tap.

Budget : A good buy from a branded company at the range of 15k

Cons : The only drawback I have faced in this phone is that the headphone Jack is located at the bottom making it a bit uncomfortable to use during travel. The sound quality doesn't seem to be Dolby atmos as claimed but is satisfactor.

Overall,  I would happily recommend this phone to anyone who is planning to have a branded , high battery yet reasonable price phone.

I give this review after 15days,I got this phn on 29th sep,,,....Everything is best in this price range,,,camera ,display,battery,fingerprint....bole to aur kya chahiye???processor was good ,if u want u can gaming with this ,it is equal to snadragon 675,and m30s is the best optimization UI,no add...if its price remain 14000 ,I would say it is the best other than mi or realme....but I got this phone on Amazon at price 11600 and 1 year free screen replacement,thnks to Amazon for such a beautiful offer and quick delivery...you great...but only two cons is there one is back body is carbonate body ,so easily scratched so use with cover..and two is when u capture a photo with 48mp cam,taking some time for saving ,Also when u see the photo on gallery pic load to it's original view so take some time but that not means it lags....simply it takes some time to load high quality pic...I think update will minimizes that....great phone ,I always use branded phone ,I use moto so mny year but now I think I go with this monster phn with brand....using from 15 days ,I didn't see any kind of lag....only back side got scratched easily ,back built quality is not up to the mark otherwise all superb gd back bodys color design ,it has dedicated ni8 mode,Dolby atmos so mny option....u can go for it...and battery life just one word wwwwwooooowwwwwww.....enjoy ur m3os

Worst product ever used. Network issues. Signal suddenly goes down in same location
where it was working and you will not aware. Limited number of fingers option for finger print scanner. Finger print scanner also not good. Its battery is same like 4000 battery. I'm getting  similar  battery backup as 4000 mah one. Worst camera quality. I don't recommend it. I would  like to return if they allow me. I'm getting other  mobiles similar price and with good options. Made mistake by going with spec and brand.

Have been using the phone for the past 2 weeks. This is my first Samsung  phone. Would  not go for Samsung  in the past as they were too expensive and laggy in the midrange models.  My previous phone was an Asus max pro m1 which was excellent  but the battery  had puffed up within  13 months and hence I decided to replace it. Would have blindly gone for another Asus but there was no proper successor to the max pro!

Anyways,  the hiccup I mention happened to be this weird  behavior of my idea sim. The idea sim would not allow itself to be registered on the network.  I would get the network bars but no calls ,no internet could be made. Tried multiple  idea sims but same issue.  Vodafone n jio worked fine. Amazon customer support was poor.  I explained the problem but they insisted on sending a technician to physically inspect the phone a week later.  I had to roam with two phones  for over a week as I use dual sims.
First time I was disappointed with Amazon return policy.

Anyways,  the technician dint turn up( great
after sales support Amazon!!)and I just reinserted the idea sim into the phone and it worked flawlessly.  I have no idea what  made it work but there was some writing on the Samsung box mentioning using Indian sim card first and then other foreign sims can buy used.  Never heard of this in any other phones I had... guess this was causing the issue .
Now the everything works fine! I hope it doesn't  return again as the replacement window is over .

The positive are its 6k mAh battery  though it shows it to be 5800 odd mAh design capacity
on AccuBattery and 5364 mAh as estimated  capacity. I get 10hrs screen on time which is what I expected.  I am a heavy phone user n hence I needed a big battery phone! The camera is good enough  and the amoled screen is awesome!

The negatives which  might  put of some people are the lack of ambient light sensor,  it automatically adjusts brightness but it's a little slow to react,seems to use the front camera to assist in that. This makes finding the answer menu difficult if u pull ur phone out of ur pocket  in bright sunlight.

Due to my initial hiccup, feel network range is spotty,  making calls require two tries to connect sometimes,  happens on n off. No double tap to wake makes u use the physical button wake the phone. The phone doesn't come with Corning glass, so a screen guard is a must.  Also the speaker is that loud enough.

Overall,  a very good device from Samsung,  worth it for its battery and screen. Lack of ambient light sensor  is the only negative that impacts me a lot.

After using for 9 days, Here are my views on Samsung M30s(6 GB/128 GB- 14k after Amazon cashback). (This is my first ever purchase of Samsung Mobile)

Pros:
Battery Performance-------10/10
Display-----------------------9/10
Software------------------------------------8.5/10
Gaming-------------------------------------8.5/10
Camera (Daylight: Photo-shoot and Video)-------------------------8.5/10
Face Unlock and Fingerprint sensor------8/10

Cons:
Charger(15W)---------------------------------------------------------7/10
Camera (Night light: Photo and Video)------------------------------5.5/10

Summary:
A complete pack for the people who wants performance and value for money.  Processor Exynos 9611 made this package faster and battery efficient. With normal usage, It can work up to 2 days and it takes around 2.5 hours to full charge. Other than that crisp display, 48MP shoot, ultra-wide-angle camera, super slow motion and many more...
I played PUBG at a full resolution setting around 30 min and it performs outstandingly well, bit warm but perfectly ok with these settings.
The only thing which I find less remarkable is the camera (photos and videos) in low light conditions and Android 10 update.
Overall fully satisfied, I am happy to be part of the Samsung family.
Last but not the least Amazon's fast delivery, purchased on the first day of its sale and received within 16 hours.

Its better with this Price..Its Battery is too longlasting. Very useful to buy. Dont go for any other devices, if you will have budget for this amount.
Here are some my personal view by using of this phone as following:-
Display is Super AMOLED, outdoor display brightness is better than M30,
Ultra-wide camera is improved and captures 123 degree
Battery is bigger enough to be compared with a battery of MacBook Pro,
Phone is lightweight as 188gm while holding a bigger battery with capacity of 6000mAh,
Triple camera setup includes a 48mp Samsung GM1 sensor, an 8mp ultra wide angle lens and a 5mp depth. Front camera is also 16mp
It does not have EIS but Super Steady mode is impressive. It can record 4K videos, Super Slow-Mo and Hyper lapse
Type-C port along with a 3.5mm headphone jack provided
Exynos 9611 octa-core chipset based on a 10nm process. Same processor has been used on Samsung A50S which is being sold at higher price by same brand. Performance is smooth and competent for playing games because Exynos 9611 is better than the Snapdragon 665 as per my experience,

Processor is power consuming but Battery performance is as per upto expectation.
Small size apertures (48mp cam with an f/2.0 aperture, 5mp with an f/2.2 and 8mp with f/2.2.) capture less light through it. Result average night mode and less blurred bokeh,
Front cam selfie lack detailing and seems smoother.

Excellent product by Samsung....Really an outstanding  product.....using it since last few days.....touch is soooooo smooth....and camera quality  is also very very excellent....just fell in love with photography after taking this product in hand.....fingerprint reader is also too good .....in setting the fingerprint in only one touch it has done 100% verification.....and of course  it's battery basically I think Samsung gave an inverter to you....after fully charged,I didn't  charge for 3 days....and its battery was only 25%...down....so you just can imagine  what type of battery  it got....it's monstrous ....and yes in those 3 days I fully used it by watching  videos....playing  games....taking  Pictures....so guys I think one should  really go with this excellent product.....its great one.....truly loving  using  Samsung  M30s......👌👌👌👌❤❤❤...

I have been using Samsung M30S from the past 15 days and so far, it's all good.

My first impression was that the phone packed such a huge battery so neatly.
But, somewhere, the backside gives a slight plastic like feel.
The Super AmoLED display is outstanding and the battery lasts easily for more than two days.
Amongst the cameras, the primary 48MP camera is very good but the other two are satisfactory. We get many options here, though.
So far, the performance is very good and the fingerprint and other sensors are working very well.
Dolby Atmos Sound option is available, when earphones are plugged in.
The SAR value too is well within the limits.
There is a dedicated SD card slot which is a plus but the SIM card holder is very thin and delicate.
Overall, when a trusted brand adopts an aggressive pricing strategy and offers a device  with such good features, any phone buyer  simply cannot refuse the deal.
I also got cashback in Amazon which further enhanced its Value for Money aspect......

Nice feature phone camera quality is great in this price the weight is little bit on the heavier performance is great. The only worst thing about this phone is that many apps from Samsung are not available in this phone. Samsun pay including Samsung pay mini,Samsung flow,Samsung side sync and many Samsung apps dont support the device. And the price is also going down day by day. I bought this phone at 16,999 and after some days I saw the price 14999.
I was  thinking of returning this phone because I was feeling cheated. I am a regular costumer of Samsung  but this time Samsung put me in a negative mood
If you want to use this phone only for camera and battery  the go ahead but if you a looking for feature like Samsung pay etc then better buy some other phone from market

The phone is good and has most of the premium features. The battery is the best which can last a day after hours of gaming and rigorous use. Will go upto 2 days with normal use. Camera quality is also good in daylight and lowlight conditions however it's somewhat blurry if taken at 48MP resolution. No lags are there and the device stays cool after usage. The finger print sensor is a tad bit slower however.

Its the amazing phone under the price range, also tha sapphire blue is an awesome color and eye catchy.
After using it fir a week I can surely say it has awesome battery life and great camera quality. On comparison with redmi note 8 pro, the winner is surely the Samsung M30S, the touch sensor and face unlock feature is working awesome.
The fast charging feature is amazing and it charges the battery to 60%in less then 30 minutes.
The processor and 6 GB ram with 128 GB storage capacity its the fully loaded phone.
Its a worthy option to choose from a wide range of options available in market.
You can count on it.

Camera is average.
Performance of the processor is okay.

Face lock is super fast even identify the face in dark light as well.

What I like the most is the Display. The battery life is insane. I'm using it from the morning with 60% battery level at the end of the day still 35% is remaining!! Performance is very fluid. It can play PUBG in HDR..  what else. RAM management is good. Sound via headphone jack and speaker could be louder but it is good enough. Camera is good enough in this price segment. The user interface is clean, very optimized and smooth to use, though there are some bloatwares but it can be uninstalled. Overall a good experience.

I was in for a new phone on the market, from my old Moto g4 which was in Nougat, and had only 2 gigs ram and 16 gigs storage. So when I set out to look for a phone, I looked for:
1. Killer Battery
2. Pretty Good Screen
3. Type C fast charge is a must
4. Good customer support.
5. At least 64gigs storage
6. Cameras are not a priority, but if it's good, I ain't complainin.
7. Processor and GPU are not a priority

My budget was 17k. And I shortlisted Realme XT, Redmi Note 7 pro and this. And I am ecstatic with the choice that I had made.

This phone is a killer deal, when I exchanged my old phone and paid with 10% discount bringing the 128 GB variant down to 13.5k.

The screen is absolutely brilliant. The battery life is, as advertised monstrous. The charging time is also not too bad, about 2.5 hours for a full charge. But the 6000mah lasted me 3 days no joke, with about 14 hours screen on time. Given I am not a power user, I watch YouTube and live streams on Twitch.

The camera is not as good as a Realme or a Redmi, same goes for the processor and GPU.

Remember, if your priorities shift more towards a camera or a better GPU, go for Realme XT/5 pro or a Note 7 pro, though I suggest waiting for the Note 8 pro. But if your priorities align with mine, just go for this.

PS The delivery guy was absolutely helpful and amazing, I hope Amazon takes care of the good employees just as much as "taking care" of the bad ones, if you know what I mean.

Been using the phone since a couple days from launch and 1. Battery life has been really good from my medium usage of WhatsApp and some light games and web browsing. 2. Screen is definitely an amazing panel with good colors and hd viewing on prime video. 3. Body creaks a little bit, but it's been fine now that I added a case on like I do with all my phones. 4. Samsung One UI is really nice to use and can remove bloatware that comes installed unlike miui on my other phones. It's pretty fluid and smooth. Definitely better than MIUI which is better than ColorOS in my opinion. Also doesn't seem to heat much at all from my use case scenario. Overall I really like it.

I would like to provide 5 rating and gave more than that if available.

Battery:  5 out of 5

Powerful battery !!! If you sleep background/unused applications than it's will give you best result.

Camera: 4 out of 5

It will give you best result i.e. mind blowing clarity.

Issue: when you capturing the super slow videos then its slightly fluctuating.

Processor:  5 out of 5

Provide you good speed in terms of application accessibility.

Sound: fair enough

Display:  5 out of 5

It really surprise you that the display is quite smooth

Delivery: 5 out of 5

I got this item within 2 hours. Amazing delivery by Amazon Prime Now.

So the overall rating is 5 as almost all features are great. Also the price which I got was great.

Thumbsup:

1. Battery life is good. As I am not much of a gamer, idk about performance with gaming.

2. Camera is very good. Video recording could have improved functionalities though. But then, with this aggressive pricing, what do you expect, right?

3. Already dropped it several times, and nothing happened, so far. No cracks on the screen, no touch disfunctionality. Sturdy built.

4. Always on display shows clock on screen even when the screen is off, so that you don't have to press power button everytime you want to see the time. And makes it look unique and different.

Thumbsdown:

1. I hate to install 3rd party appware for themes and fonts etc. and never tried them. However, without 3rd party, all these have to purchased. That disappoints as well.

2. Fingerprint sensor - there is the disappointment. Very slow, compared to other brands. Sometimes, doesn't even detect until you turn on the screen with the power button. Samsung could improve on that, as I have a friend who owns a samsung A50 and fingerprint there is also slow.

Overall:

Very satisfied. Nothing can ever be perfect subjectively. So, 4 stars due to the fingerprint sensor and purchases. Improve that and you have a 5 star at this price point.

As I have ordered the product on 28th September and received next day on 29th September is really awesome thanks to Amazon delivery services

Coming to product I want to declare in several points why it is awesome  and must buy.

1. Major factor is its monstrous  battery of 6000mah as best in its class and it comes with the fast charging type c which really lasts 1.5 days easily
2. Coming to display  its my first Samsung phone and display is awesome (i.e. super amoled) .
3. Camera  - the rear camera comes with many effects like super slow videos  really awesome and front facing camera good for selfies &amp; it shows true colour.
4. Biometrics- the face id works really nice in even low light &amp; fingerprint is awesome to use.
Other than that it supports Dolby atmos which is supported in earphones &amp; speakers.

3.improved camera compared to Samsung midrangers from early 2019

Camera:- At this price point, or rather till 20000 price, this is the best camera one can get. It's triple camera. Yeah we got Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi but when it comes to trust, one can put his faith only on renowned brands like Apple, Samsung, Motorola.

Fingerprint Reader:- it's not at the best position. As the phone is of massive size, sometimes you might not get your finger at the correct spot. But that's not a big problem.

Battery Life:- It's 6000 mah. It's the best at this segment or any segment I know. It's too good. No other phone provides a magnificent battery like this. And yeah it just takes an hour and a half to charge it completely and will last you 2 days.

Price:- it's a perfect budget phone. Seeing the present inventions, we can say that within 2 years, your phone will get outdated. So just get the best phone present today. This is the most updated right now.

RAM and Storage:- 6GB and 128GB. You just don't need anything else...

expected much from this mobile but still for Samsung in this price this phone is surprise. I Got Android Pie with One UI 1.5 along with adaptive fast charging adaptor out of the box. Let me share with you my experience;

PROS;
✓✓ Display is Super AMOLED, outdoor display brightness is better than M30,
✓✓ Ultra-wide camera is improved and captures 123 degree
✓✓ Battery is bigger enough to be compared with a battery of MacBook Pro,
✓✓ Phone is lightweight as 188gm while holding a bigger battery with capacity of 6000mAh,
✓✓ Triple camera setup includes a 48mp Samsung GM1 sensor, an 8mp ultra wide angle lens and a 5mp depth. Front camera is also 16mp,
✓✓ It does not have EIS but Super Steady mode is impressive. It can record 4K videos, Super Slow-Mo and Hyper lapse,
✓✓ Type-C port along with a 3.5mm headphone jack provided,
✓✓ Exynos 9611 octa-core chipset based on a 10nm process. Same processor has been used on Samsung A50S which is being sold at higher price by same brand. Performance is smooth and competent for playing games because Exynos 9611 is better than the Snapdragon 665 as per my experience,

CONS;
✓✓ Body is made of plastic which makes it quality inferior and does not give it a premium look like other Samsung phones,
✓✓ Front screen and Back glass are not protected like Corning Gorrila Glass so beware of losing it. (If you have enrolled for Amazon 1 year screen replacement program then fine otherwise AMOLED display replacement can cost you minimum Rs.6k)
✓✓ Processor is power consuming and Battery performance is not upto expectation, even its same almost like M30 as I compared with my brothers phone,
✓✓ 15W fast charging is slow for this giant battery,
✓✓ Small size apertures (48mp cam with an f/2.0 aperture, 5mp with an f/2.2 and 8mp with f/2.2.) capture less light through it. Result average night mode and less blurred bokeh,
✓✓ Front cam selfie lack detailing and seems smoother and Super steady mode does not work on it,
✓✓ No inscreen fingerprint sensor like Mi A3 which is earlier launched in lower range,
✓✓ NFC is no future technology and missing it in a latest phone does make it lack at some point
✓✓ Face unlock is not faster and effective
✓✓ Slo-mo video Flickers in artificial lightening

Final verdict;
As per my experience if you want to stuck with Samsung then you can go for Samsung M30 which will give you better battery backup with lighter weight and less mAh and better image quality in lesser megapixels and bigger Aperture.
And if you can go with another brand then Xiaomi A3 is an option which is more economical with better camera, inscreen fingerprint sensor and display protected by Corning Gorilla glass.

I have been using this phone for last one and half month and I'm fully satisfied with this SAMSUNG product and proud on my decision of relying on this brand.

If you are looking for a phone comprising of majority of features then M30s is the one.

Pros:
-6000 mAh is working really well for more than two days of normal use. I heard rumors about battery life but SAMSUNG does provide a battery life best in the market.
- 6GB and 128 GB is the limit as far as RAM and ROM are concerned.
-Camera is also good enough to capture all details.
-the inbuilt features of the phone are so good that it eliminates downloading and installing third party applications.
-Super AMOLED display from SAMSUNG is best in the market which gives amazing movie viewing experience.
- BEST PART IS USER INTERFACE OF THIS PHONE WHICH ONE CAN NOT GET IN BRANDS LIKE MI, VIVO OR OPPO.
-Purchased it (6+128) in just 15300 INR, great value for money.
-You get two nano sim slots and SEPARATE memory card slot ( up to 512 GB).
-Reliability of brand like SAMSUNG.

Cons:
-For those, whose major emphasis on CAMERA only, then you may get bit disappointed with this phone.
-Esthetics may look a aspect where SAMSUNG could have improved.

"I don't play games so I can not comment on gaming on this Phone".

Worth buy it😅.

Ultimate battery backup,
camera quality is not as expected.

Pros
Astounding battery life
Great shooting capabilities
Smooth performance
Immersive Super AMOLED display
Cons
Night mode isn't the best
Selfie shooter could've been better
No display protection
Take one look at the list of most popular phones in 2019, and you'd see how Samsung has been able to script a strong comeback in the budget and mid-range segment, a category which has been awash with Chinese brands for a long time. While it seemed nigh impossible last year, the Chaebol has done this on the back of an impressive lineup in the form of its all-new M series and refreshed A series. And some of its phones even managed to grabbed headlines by offering industry first features. The Galaxy M30 (review) for instance, was one of the rare handsets that flaunted a triple-camera setup under Rs 15k, when it was introduced back in February. So it was certainly interesting to see what Samsung comes up with next, and we've got our answer with the Galaxy M30s (first impressions). To figure out if the new phone is just an evolutionary upgrade or can it offer something more, here's a deep dive into its capabilities.

Hi Amazon,

As i received this product day 1 itself facing a issues and problems.Regarding on this i raised a complaint but no solution asked for a refund and Replacement but u guys r simply ignoring my REQUEST.

1)Hanging issues(2 times) and its New Product
2)Battery getting Heating problems
3)Cam Quality not as expected
4)Touch Problems some times it works unusually

As i raised to u r Care sent a TECHNICIAN he simply checked 15-30 mins came up with simple solution No ISSUES,how come he knows without using as a single day of half day. Of-course he's a technician fine, but as per Human Psychology it works properly when technician uses the phone,but after USER Uses the phone we will get the issues.

And,Now today morning(18-02-2020) same mentioned problems and extra benefits and gifts like while pressing home Button it migrated into Black and blur screen and continuously VIBRATING 2-3 mins Until unless it gets normal and went to Servicing center today morning while technician only faced this problem not an user and screenshots the issues if u don't trust me just ask near by Samsung Servicing center whether this user came r not with this phone and issue. Will attach screenshots and find them.

As a middle class man trusting u r site since when u r site launched in INDIA and buying products whenever i have scope, but this time very much disappointed not even u r care also not supporting properly simple came up with a solution install Blancco app and raise a complaint, of-course raised but no use every time same old process repeat means how can i bear and take a time to explain everything i have faced and  not even completed 10 days for  this product and Very first time when call happening and  asked u r Executive in future if it repeated means what i'm suppose to do no ANSWER.

Please take it as a serious ACTION and i just asking REFUND r else change and replace the product that also u r responding properly.

Regards

Good device otherwise, but the Samsung's bloatware has gone way too noisy and too far intruding in and spoiling overall user experience and data privacy. One can see that they must have put hundreds of thousands of $ to find loopholes in GDPR and other data privacy compliance laws (at least in India). I gifted this to my parents, who are not so much aware of the data privacy concerns and the strategies of companies to get people install their Apps and give consents to share data by bombarding them with popups. I am really worried about this and have to keep a close watch continuously on what's on the phone. I trusted Samsung for respecting user's data privacy, but I am disappointed.

Camera: The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots.

Battery: I am really happy with battery backup as it lasts up to approx 2 days.

Design, Touch, Look &amp; Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light.

some times mobile will be hanging and Es file explorer doesn't installing in that Mobile.very slow installing

First of all i have bought this monster from amazon at 14k . Starting from pros:-

1-This is a hardcore mid range phone having massive 6000 mah battery which usually gives 2 days backup for normal usage,so guys just go for it who wants a gud battery life there is no competition for this massive battery in this price range. ( 5 stars for battery backup)
2- Ram managment and battery optimisation of this phone are of next level believe me guys samsung has done a lot of hard work in this area , very less people look into these two points but i have mentioned them here for hardcore users.
3-Camera is ok ok , not upto the level of samsung but still providing lot of modes nd features which are best in this price range.(3 stars for camera)
4-Now coming to UI , i m personally fan of Samsung's UI,  and samsung has tried to put almost all features like AOD, blue light filter, power saving modes etc ...which will give u feel of a 30k range phone.(so 5 stars for UI)
Now coming to CONS
1-First of all the camera hasn't that clearity of 48 MP its gud for outdoor photography, but for low light pics it is not up to the mark.
2- nd this 1 for all the hardcore gamers, the headphone jack on the lower left side is always creating problem and i personally found it very annoying
3- dolby atmos aren't creating any out of the box effects , i didnt find it much useful and i m not a hardcore music lover but for music lovers it will matter.
4- PROTECTION  this is my personal advice to samsung that u guys are providing a 6000mah battery phone ,even if the weight management is awsm ,but still phone is heavy u should have given gorilla glass protection, now a days people look for it gone r the days when people didnt notice these things ,
So plz look in to this.
PARDON ME FOR THE GRAMMATICAL ERRORS.

Cons:
After using it for 30 mins continuous, it starts to heat up.
2.2 GB of RAM is consumed by Samsung UI and OS itself; thereby, leaving only 1.8 GB of use-able RAM space out of 4 GB.
Prolong gaming can cause the game to hang, I played PokemonGO for 3 hours continuous, in afternoon, the mobile got overheated and game got hanged twice. Although, as soon as it cools down, it works properly.
Pros:
Superb Camera quality.
Long lasting Battery.
Light weight and slim design.
Good display quality, since it has sAMOLED.

Edit after 1 month. Few points added/improved/changed after OTA update and long term use.

Pros: 1)excellent battery.. 15-16 hours of screen on time. Edit: After receiving OTA update with November security patch, battery performance has improved further. Now I get 17-18 hours of screen on time. Simply amazing. Truly Monster battery. 5/5.

2)Magnificent FHD+ super AMOLED display.. Great for watching movies and YouTube videos. Vivid mode gives great vibrant colors. Joy to watch. 5/5.

3)smart RAM management with lightweight OS compared to bloated OS of chinese phones. Apps stay in background even with 4 GB version for long time compared to other phones. 5/5.

4)UFS 2.1 storage is amazing. File transfer is so fast compared to EMMC storage. Transferring movie from laptop to phone is fast. 5/5.

5)Dark mode/night mode/black theme looks very sleek and stylish due to super AMOLED display. With coming Android 10 OneUI 2. 0, all apps will support it. 5/5

6)Capable processing power of Exynos 9611. Handle all day to day tasks smoothly. Slightly struggles for Heavy gaming. But that's reasonable enough considering price. 4.5/5

7)Dolby Atmos audio. Improves Audio output significantly for Earphones. But can't be used for Loud speaker. 4/5.

8)camera is decent enough for this price. Daylight pics are excellent, low light night photography can be improved further by updates. 4/5

9)Low SAR value is quite good. 4/5

10)Build quality: Plastic body feels bit cheap but it helps to keep weight down. Especially with 6000 mah battery, weight can go very high but managing it under 188 g is incredible job. So this is kind of neutral. 3.5/5

Cons:1)charging could've been faster.
It isn't slow especially considering massive battery of 6000 MAH but 15W seems slightly old/outdated. Would've liked 18-20W charger at least. 3/5

2)single loud speaker isn't as loud as expected. Not as clear in noisy environment as I would've liked. 3/5

3)This is the only true con of this phone as 2 points above are not that bad. Lack of dedicated ambient light sensor for auto brightness. Samsung uses front camera for auto brightness which is slow and uses a lot of battery. So I always set brightness manually and just avoid it altogether. 1/5

Summary : a very decent phone for normal day to day usage which class leading battery and superb display.

Final verdict: 4.5/5. Half star deducted due to lack of light sensor.

Do not buy this phone.. it's the worst phone I ever experienced.  It cannot play a multi touch game like pubg n mobile legends which need two hands to control it. This phone, if I use other half screen with other half hand than the other half screen does not works... it's a mess.. I bought opal black n sapphire blue, I want to return both I won't my money back.. I frankly says that this is robbery. Selling third class goods for high price... it's not a smart phone...it horrible

Everything is ok but camera quality is so so poor front and back also...The picture quality is like 5 m.p camera..Just go for mi a3......Back panel is made off so poor plastic,,when you ring or make a call there will be a vibration on back plastic,,,,it is so irritating....Phone is also slow and network reception is very poor... Display is crysp and sharp like samsung s9.Dont waste your money just go for mi a3 without any doubt..........

Crashes often. No solution to that. Lots of bloatware. Stick to simple UI based phones even if you have shell out more. Not worth the irritation. Considering buying another phone.
Battery is the only thing that is dependable. Rest is just ok.

Perfect phone in midrange. This phone  is well balanced between looks and performance. I was  amazed despite 6000mah battery,  it is soo slim and the life of the battery is really good it lasts for 2 days  on normal usage and the overall  performance  is decent. When it comes  to gaming it do well in medium settings and do lag at high graphics which was a bit  disappointing although it shows in Pubg HD with ultra settings but in reality it lags a lot. But as a daily usage it do pretty well and I loved  it.

It's quite a great phone at this price. Still I didn't received my ₹1000 cashback for which I'll have to complaint to amazon. Superb battery backup. Nice camera. Great display, nice sensors, outlook is fine, back cover is plasticy but it's fine in this range. I've not done any heavy usage till now. Will update if anything else.

Samsung M30S, Never even thought of buying it...was looking for a mobile in the 15 to 20k range, had a look at all the brands for almost 15 days, couldn't decide, even the "A" series of Samsung had newer models but finally picked up this one.
Before opting for this one, actually got to see it with one of my associates, and I was quiet impressed with the looks, camera quality, slow video rec, and moreover the feel of it. In less than 30 mins, had ordered this one on Amazon.
After a months use, the battery quality is superb!! It lasts for a full day long, and  with lot of calls, browsing , YouTube, the battery doesn't drain out too at all.
Charging is definitely fast and the sound quality good for this range.
Overall very satisfied with this model, though used a different very popular brand for a month, but switched back to Samsung as the UI was better than the popular brand.
Got it at 12500 with cash back.
Amazon gave excellent service by replacing the phone as the one that was delivered, had a problem with the camera, but in less than 24 hours, I had a replacement by Amazon.
All in all, very good mobile compared to other brands.

Initial impressions seems good.
Hopefully will get good life for long term use.

Pros: Battery life, dedicated micro SD card slot, good quality display, Nice main camera.
Cons: Will start to slow down as the number of apps increase, not so fast finger print scanner, average face recognition, average front cam.

The product was delivered on time. The display is amazing and touch is as smooth as butter. I used a J7 before and the screen doesn't appears to be too big, It fits right in the pocket. Only thing that I was disappointed is that there is no earphone included in the package which I feel a basic thing that must be included along with phone.
Overall it's worth every paisa..  go for it

Best phone in the department of screen ,battery , software and camera too
Phone has got android 10 update and running smoothly ,battery is best ,screen is amoled the best
Just litle bit bulky but that's acceptable as you are getting almost twice the battery  capacity than the other phones
No need to worry about glass protection even it's not gorila glass it is rugged glass without any screen protector my dad is using this phone ,screen protection is good no need to think about gorilla glass ,this phone have as good as gorilla glass 4 standard or may be better ,again depend upon user but glass protection is good one can use phone without any screen protector its glass withsatnd all daily activities very easily without getting scratched

4)  Performance – The main thing in this phone is performance. No major heating issue. Processor works very well while operated continuously almost 4 hours.

5)  Security – Face unlock and finger performance in this phone is very speedy and liked it very much.

Pros:

1)  Super Display.

2)  Amazing Performance

3)  Good battery

6)  Audio quality is awesome.

7)  Call quality is clear

8)  18 W fast charging

9)  Android Pie ( Cherry on the cake 😍)

Cons:

1)  No cover and glass provided( Not a big issue for me).

2)  No LED notification light.(But it’s Okay)

In short very too much Pros but very less Cons.

One can go for this “Monster in the market” Blindly. It will not disappoint you.

That’s it from me !!!

Hope this review is helpful. Click the helpful option.🙂

A 1 month review.

Pros:
Battery : Primary point being battery, it serves its purpose. 6000mAh battery runs for 30 hours on one go with a medium usage and 4g internet continuously switched on.

Display : S-AMOLED is clear, crisp and bright, but with the screen guard on it.. It struggles a bit outdoors in bright light.

Call quality and Network : Calls are usually clear and loud. Network fluctuates with 4g in the semi-rural areas.

Face recognition : It is quick and properly functional as a biometric.

Phone functionality and Speed: The animation, storage and RAM management are good and gives a great multi-tasking experience.

Cons:
Fingerprint: The fingerprint is slow and sometimes takes multiple taps to function.

Camera: The camera struggles with manual focus and the photos from back camera have colors little washed out. Video is also pretty unstable during slight jerks. But, the front camera is good.

Summary : For a 14k prize.. It is awesome phone in its segment. Great for people who are into travelling and medium users.

This one is "no" for hardcore gamers and Camera freaks.

I ordered Samsung galaxy M30s from Amazon and got delivery on 10/02/2020. I was very happy with the model look and feel. On next day itself device got disconnected from the network, I thought there could be some problem and restarted it. After restarting it started working fine. But irony is that I had to do it frequently, so I complained this issue with Amazon and they asked me to hard reset it but it didn't help so they arranged a technician to visit my place. Technician came on 14th Feb and he also reset the device once again and he said "This problem won't occur again". This problem didn't occur for next 3 days and then on 20th Feb I faced the same network disconnection issue. I spoke to amazon customer care again and then they scheduled another technician. Technician visited today i.e. 22nd Feb and I explained him the problem and asked him to mention the problem in his report, I shown all the screenshots. I called customer care to know the procedure for returning the device and I was shocked to know that technician has mentioned that there is no problem with the device. I'm fed up of contacting amazon customer care.
I am attaching screenshots which will give assurance that there is problem with device. I cannot use this defective piece. Please help me to return this device.

The Phone is perfect at this range , but the only problem I am facing is while in call , suddenly the sounds stop going to other side , it happens daily 3-4 times . I raised complaints to amazon within 10 days they sent technician he did something phone worked very well that day bit again same problem from the very next day , I again reached out to customer care they did remote troubleshooting and found some problem with the phone they raised a replacement request and I am waiting for it to be replaced . Happy with the support. Apart from that camera quality is superb , battery life is obviously good being 6000mah . Home layout and display is superb . No heating problem I play pubg for hours it very smooth and no heating at all .The unique features like blue light filter saves your eyes .And obviously it looks stylish have got multiple praise from frinds .😍😍😍

Dear Samsung, i share Professional review, please take it seriously:
1. The Heavy weight of device that not worthy, becomes 400gm after normal back cover.
2. No notification light ( why Samsung did not respond well small LED light bulbsfeels professional thing ..no we didn't want always-on display)
3. No headphone connection symbol while connecting Headphones♧
4. Headphone connector / Jack placed at wrong side that become obstacle to hand when in landscape mode..
5. No zoom in zoom out option when video recording in Slow motion, super slow motion why?
6. NO zoom in zoom out options for capturing live focus , night mode etc...
7. No any live blue option in video mode that makes negative effects
8. 48 megapixel is hopeless , stop making fools to people it not the hardware of 48mp it just 12 megapixel lenses and stretch to 48 mp via software... faid off!!!
9. Battery backups is remarkably good. Feel better when other phones are dimmed off and this working long lasting.
10. No Infrared(IR) sensor, why???
11. Involve more technical approach because Samsung is technically strong company (hopefully).

Thank you

M30S is a well balanced device.
 •Battery life is phenomenal. Can easily last 2days even with heavy usage.
•Camera quality is good ( not exceptional). I gave "good" because of the stabilization in video recording which is really superb. Wide angle mode gives a large field of view.
•One UI is really very good. (Earlier Samsung's TouchWiz was kind of crappy. And made budget oriented devices go lagging quite fast. But that is kind of solved with OneUI).
Tied up with Exynos 9611 the performance for day to day tasks seems to be smooth. (But still haven't tried any games)
•Display quality is awesome. They are indeed the pioneers in this field of Amoled displays. (But only Gorilla glass 3 level protection in this era of level 6 or atleast 5)
•Build quality is just OK. But the plastic unibody design feels good in hand - "With PHENOMENAL WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION"
•The major issue I feel Is the device doesn't use the full potential of the network speed.
Call quality is fine. But the internet speed is just average when compared with other devices in the same network, in the same area.
• And afterall the customer service of Samsung is good compared to other Chinese counterparts.

When there is competition among brands consumers always benefits.

Great price...great deal...got it only Rs. 10k ....thanks Amazon for super fast delivery....
Let's come to the mobile now...
This phone has a giant 6000 mAh battery which is more than enough for day long performance...I regularly played 4-5 hrs. Pubg..but battery still  remains more than 30%.... I watched 3 movies in a day just consuming 38%....video quality was excellent... color pigments are bright and beautiful...4K video shoot available..
Contain Exynos 9611 giving smooth performance...no lag issue found... processor is as powerful as Snapdragon 675... Built quality is average... backside is made from polycarbonet plastic material, but the super AMOLED screen gives you mobile a nice looks and feeling.
Rear Camera is really good... front camera is average....but manageable at this price tag... Now comes to the rating...
Screen 10/10
Built Quality 7/10
Battery  10/10
Rear Camera 9/10
Front Camera 8.5/10
Processor 8/10
Overall performance 9/10
Value for Money 10/10

After using around 20days, I am writing this review.

Phone is average....now a days lots of phone available in this range with more stability than M30S.

Problems observed..
1. network issue... Most of the time whenever u call it says out of reach or switched off...whereas other phones r working perfectly at same location same network.

2. Although battery is 6k... Performance is not good as compared to other phone with 4k battery.

3. Application stability... From last four days I'm trying to upload few photos on "Google Photo" shared album using brodband connection....but unable to do the same.....later transfer the photos using shareit on other phone and uploaded in a minute.

4. Material used for back cover is made of cheap plastic....and may damage your phone internally if u drop it mistakenly....

This product is like a Eureka from Samsung ,it's just an unbelievable gadget at an unbelievable price, battery back  very good as comparison to any other phone in the market ,
1-let's come to screen - I can bet u would never have seen this type of screen in any of the budget phone available, it is just superb, the colour, the quality ,touch response all the thing are just ossom
2-lets come to the Design- yes it look like u have premium phone in your hand ,the glossy look, quality of fiber and also the weight of the phone (is not heavy),The camera position make the phone look more beautiful.
3 -camera feature- in present world everyone is so obsessive about how they look and even how can they become beautiful and handsome  ,so this is the phone for u because it give you quality and precision to your pictures , you can click WIDE PICTUreS ,slow motion pictures and PORTRAIT AS WELL AS ULTRA SLOW MOTION VIDEOs . specifically the steady mode  help us to make for perfect videos , as you wanted earlier is possible now
4 . conclusion -The phone made by Samsung is the best phone at this price  in market  if u r thinking there are other options also available in the market with less price of 1000 to 2000 I will say please don't buy them
Go with this phone Samsung M30s
So that you will never regret about your decision thinking about the day u have bought  some other phone .thank a lot

Super phone. Display, Camera, Battery, Smoothness, Performance all are awesome.
  Display is just outstanding.
  Front camera should be improved by software update. It is not up the mark in compare to its competitors.

  Only one draw back is built quality. The plastic quality is too poor. If you tap the plastic on the side of the phone you will get the sound of that plastic. Due to reduce weight samsung has used very thin plastic. So built quality is not good.
Otherwise all are awesome.

The Samsung M30S is locked to Indian sim deliberately not mentioned in product description. Only on delivery you discover the Sticker. Not transparent or AMAZON/SAMSUNG deliberately cheats customer s. YOU NEED TO CALL INDIA BY INDIA SIM FROM EVERY COUNTRY FOR 5 MINUTES IE RS 5000/ EXTRA SPENT IF A NON INDIAN SIMS HV TO BE USED. RESTRICTIVE PRACTICE &amp; MIS LEADING CONSUMERS.

It has a fairly decent camera and fingerprint sensor.
The camera is no iPhone/OnePlus camera. It does it's job. Photos are decent enough for the average user. Don't expect high end photography and all that though.
The face recognition works well(doesn't work in darkness, as it is optical based)
Really great screen with an awesome battery life.
Call quality is good.
One UI of Samsung is minimalistic and elegant.
The processor is an Exynos 9611, and it is capable of handling some heavy games without any hiccups. Multitasking was also not an issue.
RAM management could have been better(4GB model)
Overall a good phone. You wouldn't be disappointed.

This definitely  more than expected.  I didn't  expected this product  to be more than average.  But M30s left me pretty  good impressions within few days of usage. Rear Camera quality really nice in this segment. It much closer to reality. Front camera is average. Display is unbeatable in this category. Love this! If you're on budget than don't look elsewhere. This is will not disappoint you!

I am writing this review after using 3weeks,  This phone is best for camera and battery.
1) For normal use the battery life will 2 to 2.5 days..
2) Camera quality and picture was awesome
3) This phone is provided with fast charger, it's take 2 to 2.5 HR for full charge
4) 5his mobile has dual messanger so we can have two whats app
5) mobile have separate slot for two nano SIM and memory card
6) it have optimization feature, which will clear unused data and closed unused app too, which will reduce the battery and optimise the performance
7) Fingerprint sensor was excellent, since it was in back side also added the essay accessibility
8) Phone size and quality was good
9) Performance and high utilisation, this mobile was stunning

From my view, this mobile was the best for the amount(17k after discount I got @15300).
My option, don't wait go and enjoy it..

1. The display quality is just fabulous
2. The One UI is just amazing with lots of awesome features like night mode, blue light filter etc. The UFS 2.1 makes it very easy to open any apps in fraction of seconds
3. Camera is above average in day light and average in low light.
4. Sound quality is decent. It is not loud enough, but the clarity is crystal clear. Sound output through 3 mm jack s also very good.
5. The RAM management is very nice compared to other phones in this price segment.
6. 6000 MAH battery is very good, but Exynos 9611 processor needs more optimization. For normal usage, it might come upto one and a half day and for a heavy user, it might come for one day strictly. Screen on Time is between 6.5 to 8 hours.
7. There is no heating issue when you are in call or normal internet usage, but when you use camera or OLA or Uber continuously for 20 mins, the phone heats up.
8. The call quality is very good. No call drops.

If Samsung fixes the issue of battery draining and heating issue in an update, this device would be really awesome.

Overall Samsung Galaxy M30s is a very good phone with lots of features in this price segment.

An all in one solution phone which for users like is worth buying. I am a traveller passionately &amp; officially both so the monster battery counts for me. The camera features super slow-mo &amp; hyperlapse are making it more creative as i love to visit remote areas where it is all about natural beauty. The touch and feel is nice and phone looks prestigious and handy. Overall big thumbs up Samsung for this :-)

One of the most desirable feature of this amazing mobile is it's monster battery. I was ready to carry thick mobile if long battery life is offered in mobile. It has been more than my expectation. I am average mobile user with some surfing net, watching video on YouTube and normal telephone usage. It's lasting more than 2 days and sometimes 3 days with my usage pattern.
When I unboxed it, i was pleasantly surprised with its waistline, it's amazingly thin with such a monster battery.
48mp camera is providing decent pictures in daylight.
Display is super AMOLED, so it's amazing.
Voice from both sim are crystal clear. I .Using Vodafone 4g and Jio sim for telephony. It's one of the few rare breed of mobiles which have got dedicated micro sd card slot, so memory expansion is always an option when needed. Steel not needed.
Even though it's a phone from lower midrange, nowhere it seems like cheap mobile.
Thoroughly satisfied with money i have invested in.

Samsung Galaxy Y was my first smart phone which I had bought in 2010 or 2011 I don't remember correctly. After that this M30 6+128 is my next samsung and many phones came in between. I hope this I will keep for a long time. It is easy to use, I am not into gaming, not much into photo etc but yes I surely can say camera is very good. Booting time is not very long. Sound quality is good. The overall feel is very good far better than other phones in the market. This is a must buy phone and the funny thing is when I went to get the screen pad and back cover another lady came to the shop with the same phone and it shows that this phone has swept the market already. The speed is good and usually my 50% RAM is usually unused. Although.I have most of the common apps installed but RAM is usually free all the time and 128 GB is a lot of memory. So people don't wait even if you are a gamer or not go for this phone

When I turned Samsung from Nokia, I bought Samsung J7, which superb, ultimate product ever were I used. best thing about phone was Camera, that made me quality photographer, when it turned almost 3 years then think to by new brand mobile with best camera quality. So I choosed Samsung A7 which was the first triple camera device, so I was lil excited on photographs for new device but by time I started using phone camera I dint feel the best quality. it reminds me J7 camera.. then after one year again I see this device released and I purchased!

So again expectations failed here...camera quality, phone slowness even i selected 6GB RAM/128GBInternal device... Phone body quality not that much feel me satisfied, sometime some apps get closes in mid of use..

Totally hating samsung now... think I should turn back to Nokia again yar.....

THIS REVIEW IS AFTER DOING 1 MONTH OF USAGE ( it's my own opinion,  totally unbiased so I don't favoror disfavor any of the mobiles mentioned in my comment) :-

WHY YOU SHOULD PURCHASE :
1. Great battery life ( if you are a traveller , student, bussinessman, job or service working person )
2. Big Screen with Best quality pictures &amp; videos ( if you love to watch movies on any videos )as it supports L1 , and it has Super Amoled display ( sadly, even MI NOTE 8 pro has LCD display )
3. Good Quality buildup ( though it as plastic panel at back but I love it as it reduces the risk cracking when compared to glass panel )
4. Good Quality of Sound ( actually i didn't thought but it sound is amazing )
5. Feels great in hand ( Give it a try &amp; trust me, you will love it )
6. BRAND VALUE at Budget ( I know it doesn't matter , but for me Brand is something that makes my trust higher and proud )
7. Better for Gamer ( it competes 665, 710 ) and even 712 ( don't go for benchmarks scores because real usage is a mixture of software and hardware)
8. SAR VALUE ( YES, in matters of you love your health )
9. A Good UI ( a software that makes your mobile comfortable easier or difficult) as Samsung UI makes your work easier ) and it has Same UI as in NOTE 10+ with features optimized
10. Video stabilization ( it doesn't have EIS but it has SUPER STEADY which is better than EIS )
11. VIDEO QUALITY  ( It supports slow motion,  super slow motion)
12. SAME PROCESSOR ( It has Same processor  as IN SAMSUNG A50s )
13. Regular security update ( as Samsung is still giving security updates to even Samsung S7 )
WHY YOU SHOULD NOT PURCHASE :

1. GAMER ( If you a true gamer , don't purchase it )
2. DECENT CAMERA ( Not a camera phone, it takes a very good quality of pic when compared to phones such as REALME XT, MI NOTE 8 pro ) , just go for One plus phones
3. FAILS IN DROP TEST ( If you are such a person,  whose phone drops frequently,  don't purchase it because it Super Amoled display are weak when compared to LCD &amp;TFT displays )
4. Glass Quality  ( if you love to have Gorilla glass 5 , don't purchase it because it doesn't have it and it doesn't have Glass panel at back
5. Fingerprint slow ( delays you by 0.1 second)
6. Doesn't have NFC ( as most of phones at this price range doesn't have it )
7. Doesn't have Secure Folder ( which most of Samsung phone have them )
8. ANDROID ONE ( It doesn't have it , you will love android one only if you want clear system )
9. Slow Updates ( it is giving slow updates )
10. Slow charger  ( it has 15W charger which takes approx. 2 hours and 45 minutes from 0 % to 100%, I think it must have 20W charger for such a big battery)

CONCLUSION  : GO FOR IT at this price range  . Samsung has done a very good work on M30s and this is why I purchased it . ( I compared several mobiles, after that I purchased it )

GOOD LUCK FOR EVERYONE ONE WHATEVER MOBILE YOU PURCHASE AND NOW PURCHASE YOUR DEVICE WITH SMILE 😀

Just started using the mobile for past one day..... I felt very bad on battery back up. it is draining fast....Otherwise, all other things are too good as stated in the product description .
This is the review after one week. The Battery back up is OK.. all we have to do is, switch off all notifications alerts, from Google Chrome.....

My first Samsung phone and it's awesome.
I had never thought that I'll ever buy a Samsung phone but this is worth. Best camera experience and one ui. Battery life is best in class. I'm heavy user and for me battery lasts 2 days. Amazing experience.
My Galaxy option is also plus point where it'll allow you to book flights and keep track of it.
So far So good. Two thumbs up.👍👍

For Samsung M30S 6GB Ram.
Pros:
At Rs 17k price you get, 6 GB ram, 128 GB internal with 500 GB expandable by memory card
1. Camera quality is good, just change some default settings like beauty skin mode with unnecessary smooth your face in selfies, max image resolution etc.
2. Mobile is sleek and comfortable to hold and lightweight too.
3. Wide angle camera powered with 8 MP lens is also good.
4. I have posted daylight photo, 2nd is nightmode on photo while 3rd one is captured with Auto image enhancements mode, 4th is simple 3:4 ratio 16 MP mode of Light Lanterns on evening.
5. Battery part is very impressive here, you get 6000 mAh battery, which lasts upto 1 and half day for me ( I use only Google chrome 60% use, 15% whatsapp, 20% telegram and 10% YouTube and 5% others use) upto 5-6 hours perday screen on time
Which lasts upto 30 hours backup.
6. Screen is Super Amold display.
7. Powerful processors packed with octa core works at 2.3 Ghz. Max.
8. Samsung UI 1.5 based on android 9 offers you split screen,  pop up app features.
You can use 4 apps simultaneously on 1 screen.

Cons:
1. Samsung has provided "Always On Display" option but when I tap it and activate still my display fails to remain ON and turns off at its time of 30 sec.
2. While using camera with Night mode you will get grain and noise.
3. Device comes with 15W fast charger only, still you can use 18W or 20W type C wall charger by others brand.

Rest is All Good at this price range. Because it's Samsung.
Atleast you can expect user safety along with data privacy over that Huwei, Xiomi and all Chinese brands.

The Monster by Samsung that we all were waiting for.

My last phone by Samsung was the Galaxy Corby, which was launched in 2009. A decade later I am back to Samsung and I've been using this Amazing phone for the past 4 days and experience is splendid. I'll start out with the pros.

√√ This is my first phone with a Super AMOLED display and it blew my mind away right off the bat. The deep, pure blacks are soothing to the eyes and saves battery too.
√√ It's 6.4-inch SAMOLED FHD+ and still the same size as my old 5.5-inch phone. That's terrific!!
√√ Always-On display looks splendid on this device with its minimalistic bezels.
√√ Samsung did a beautiful job with One-UI. It's fluid, intuitive and has gorgeous animations. Especially the one at the front camera during face-unlock.
√√ The screen is really bright with great outdoor visibility.
√√ I loved the scrolling screenshot feature. Really helpful and well implemented.
√√ The weight distribution is great considering the humongous 6000 mAh battery. Being 188 gms it still feels quite light.
√√ The phone can be used with one-handed because of One-UI optimizations and it's balanced weight management.
√√ The rear camera takes great shots be it with the default 12MP mode or the 48MP mode. Its dynamic range is much better than the competition.
√√ The ultrawide angle camera is quite helpful in a variety of situations and does a splendid job. It's quite wide at 123°.
√√ The battery takes the cake. 2-days with casual usage is no big deal. I get around 14 hrs SOT with casual use and 9-10 hrs with moderate/heavy usage. Just Amazing!!
√√ Exynos 9611 which is the same octa-core chipset used on Galaxy A50s performs really well. Gaming on PUBG with HDR at High settings is no sweat.
√√ The UI feels really snappy and the colors are really bright and vivid.
√√ Samsung did a great job with the game launcher. While playing PUBG the initial temps rose to 41°C which is moderate but after 30 mins of gameplay it dips down to 38°C, all thanks to the game launcher.
√√ The Super-steady video mode is a much-needed feature that Samsung does better than all its competitors.
√√ The Super Slo-mo videos are so much better than the rest.
✓✓ The Lift to wake and face unlock helps me unlock the phone without even using the power button. Cool!!
√√ Face unlock requires me to blink my eyes. Security√
√√ Fast charger in the box.
√√ Dolby Atmos is a big plus.
√√ The rear camera does not pop out. So, the phone doesn't wobble unlike some other phones *cough cough* Note 8 pro *cough cough*.
√√ UFS 2.1 storage which is much faster than eMMC 5.1 which the competitors provides.
√√ The call quality is pretty good.
√√ The speakers sound clean without any distortions.
√√ The Dark/Night Mode is a sight to the eyes on this beautiful Super AMOLED display.
√√ One-UI is a cleaner alternative to the heavily modified Chinese skins.
√√ The most under-rated plus point is its splendid RAM management. You must have experienced apps closing even when plenty of RAM is available in Chinese roms. No such issue here. Well done Samsung!!
√√ Fast app openings.
√√ Well implemented gesture-based navigation.
√√ The finger sensor gesture to open the notification bar is really helpful.

Now coming to the cons, keep in mind that no phone is perfect. And one should not keep unrealistic expectations from a phone worth just 14k.

×× The plastic body feels sturdy and won't break easily but lacks the premium feel that the competition provides with its glass back phones and gradient finish.
×× The front-cam selfies lack details and smoothens out the face. It seems like a post-processing issue. I hope they fix it with an update asap.
×× 15w fast charging is slow for such a gigantic battery. Takes 2:30 hrs for a full charge.
×× The Biggest disappointment for me is the lack of full Camera2api support which makes it difficult to get a fully working Google Camera mod. An update to this will change its camera experience to the next level.
×× The speaker is crisp but lacks just a bit in loudness.
×× The camera is slow to focus and sometimes inaccurate too.
×× The night performance seems lacking even with night mode.

Samsung has a good track of providing patches and fixes in future updates. I hope they solve all these problems with OTA updates soon.

Overall it's an excellent multimedia and entertainment device that truly lasts for days on a single charge.
Considering the Samsung brand value it's a terrific purchase for the given price and is value for money purchase.

P.S Thanks Amazon for free 1-year screen replacement😘

Samsung M30S  was launched on my birthday
....  Bought it in the week it was released (some days later) because my previous phone decided to give up on me despite having looked after it with great care.

Didn't want to spend too much, but these were my requirements while looking for a new one:
- reliable brand
- large storage
- lasting  / fast charging battery
- great camera
- comfortable UI
- should be able to get my work done  ..

I did some homework before short listing this model .... kept reading / watching user reviews  of several phones in my budget.  The only review of M30s that bothered was it could get easily scratched and glass not being the usual toughened one so breakable.

This time I was keen on spending up to 15k since 2 of my earlier phones  lasted 2 and 2.5 years respectively

I chose M30s though it was a little more than my planned budget because of the larger memory.  It arrived  later than assured due to some goof ups.

Have been using it for just a  fortnight now and I'm definitely satisfied Had to buy a flip cover immediately thanks to the review I watched.

It works great.... the 128 GB storage is a relief... because then I can download some extra apps!!! Fast charge is not as fast as one expected... but it's a 6000MaH battery so I'm cool with that.  I'm not a gamer .... so if I charge the battery tonight ... with my usual  usage,  I will  have to charge it next day after  tomorrow!

The camera in natural light is  lovely...
Even indoors  I'm happy because the colors don't become bluish or orangish. White balance is automatic  I guess.

Still to try night mode but I got some good indoor 0videos.

The sound quality is  good.  This model even has an FM radio... but guess what? It didn't come with earphones  so had to invest in that additionally.  Huge disappointment  there!

I'm still not sure about the  screen being  made of toughened Corning glass.... but all in all I think if you don't  intend to spend more than 18-20 k on a phone and still have one that delivers your checklist... Samsung's M30S is a fab purchase.

I'm content with what I've chosen....

The Samsung M30s, as they say is a monster.

Looking at the specs we have a Samsung Exynos 9611 octa core processor clocked at 2.3GHz paired with 6 gigs of RAM and the non removable 6000mAh battery with fast charging is a major pro of this phone.This will ensure that you can do whatever you want without getting tensed about battery life or the phone slowing you down.

The cameras are also another astonishing feature of this phone.At the rear we have a triple camera system consisting of 48MP+8MP+5MP and at the front we have a 16MP camera.Talking about the rear camera, it is amazing for this price range.Especially the night mode and the wide angle mode is amazing. From my personal experience the 48MP main camera is good in taking photos but when trying to take close ups or macro photography, sometimes it doesn't focus correctly and hunts for focus.The night mode gives you a vivid picture and the wide angle let's you bring everyone into the picture.The front camera is also good.The superslow-motion video mode is also fun to play with.

I have chosen the 6GB+128GB model and I haven't had a need to put in a memory card into the dual nano-SIM + memory card slot.

But some of the cons about this phone is that when looking at the build quality, it's OK but not amazing.The back panel feels very plasticky and is a fingerprint magnet.I suggest you put a quality back cover or it will look smudged and you'll have to rub it clean every time you put it back into your pocket.
Also if you game for looong hours,it may get hot sometimes but that's not an issue.
Talking about the fingerprint reader, it's fast and very responsive but it's a bit small in size but over time you'll get used to it. Unfortunately it doesn't come with a headphone even if it has a 3.5mm headphone jack.You'll have to buy another headphone.So that's another downside of this.

Overall it's a good  phone in this price range.Its adequate for people whose top priority is battery life and performance under an average price range.
I would rate it a 3.6 out of 5.

It is a killer device. Best alrounded performance at this price and best value for money and that too from Samsung brand. Its awesome.

Good quality display
Massive battery
Best Samsung phone at this price yet
No lags at all buttery smooth ui
Good camera in day light
Excellent performance even for gaming

Check my Review for M30s  after 15 days of Usage

Design :

Decent looks and build quality

The plastic body keeps the phone feeling relatively lightweight at 188 grams, which is mighty impressive for a phone packing a big 6000mAh battery

Fingerprint sensor at the back is easy to reach

Display:

Gorgeous, 6.4-inch FHD+ (2340x1080) Super AMOLED Infinity-U display with excellent viewing angles, and brightness levels - easily one of the best displays in the price bracket

Software:

Samsung's OneUI is today one of the more clean, refined Android UIs that's especially well optimized for large displays like this

Performance

Good, strong performance with the Exynos 9611 at the core (similar to Snapdragon 665) - everyday performance to high-end gaming - everything is handled smoothly

Camera

Decent rear camera setup - 48MP main sensor + 8MP wide-angle lens + 5MP depth sensor

The 16MP selfie camera too does a decent job when it comes to capturing selfies outdoors under bright light (though it starts to struggle indoors and in low light

Overall, the cameras on the M30s are decent for the price bracket, even though they are not the best

Battery:

Monster 6000mAh battery delivers an incredible 2-3 days of usage easily, making for one of the largest battery life smartphones currently available

Verdict:

With the M-series performing well for Samsung, M30s is well-set to add to that success, delivering a good all-round package with one key differentiator - an incredible battery life - if that is one of your primary concerns in a phone, then the M30s is a no-brainer

Reviewing mobile after one week of taking delivery
I had taken delivery of my M30s on 15 Oct in diwali sale with exchange of redmi note 5 pro.
Had received complementary rs 6000 screen care protection from acko insurance, so thanks to Amazon.
It gives me Full day battery backup even on heavy usage, while charging it gets little bit heat up may be bcoz of jumbo battery size.
Body build is great even it is made up of plastic one can't judge its material without taking it in his hands.
Processor works smooth even in multitasking.
Rear Camera is great, but selfie camera just f9.
In this price range Display provides me the premium feel over other mobiles with super contrast.
Finger print reader is more sensitive and at its conventional location on the rear.
Over all a premium mobile for me in just 8000 bucks ( redmi gives me 4750 back and 10% discount from icici debiit card on emi).

As a happy customer of Samsung Galaxy M30s I can say that I took a right step to buy M30s.
I got the 6GB/128 GB version at Rs. 14300/- ( 10%  credit card discount &amp; Rs. 1000/- Amazon pay Cash back) so it was at steal deal for me.
Coming to the mobile:  It's Masterpiece from the Samsung, the key features are 48MP  primary camera, Super Amoled Screen, 6000mAh battery &amp; type C . Camera has lot of features to use like: Ultra wide mode, Super slo-mo, Hyper lapse, Night mode, Super steady video  &amp; many more. Opal Black color looks cool.

Pros:
1. Samsung's Super Amoled Display is superb.
2. Samsung have done a great job in weight distribution in phone, in spite  of having 6000maAh battery phone feels very light weight in your hand. It is very handy and comfortable to use.
3. Image quality from rear camera is descent, by default it shoot images in 12MP resolution, however I haven't  tried 48MP settings.
4. 6000mAh battery is more than enough for 2 days uses.
5. Decent performance of Samsung's Exynos 9611 processor.
6. Type C 15 watt fast charger charges the phone in less than 2 hours.
7. Wide angle lens is good to shoot the wide photos. Other features like Slo-mo, hyper lapse, steady mode, live focus are also available which you will not get in this price range.
8. You can shoot videos in 4k mode.
9. Sound quality in Dolby Atmos is great.

Cons:
 1. It will receive scratches in back panel in short time.
2. 3.5mm Jack placement position little awkward, when you hold phone in hand it will disturb you.

Verdict: Go for it you will never regret

I have been using this product for 15 days now and This product turned out to be a mix bag
Pro
1. Battery life is too good
2. Screen resolution and color quality is awesome.
3. At 13990 it is one of the best phones with advance features.
Con
1. The back cover is cheap plastic.. when u press the sides , it seems loose.
2. The phone is quite heavy
3. When u are holding from the sides while watching any video , it opens command boxes. Which is irritating and ruin the fun.
4. The volume on max is too load and volume one point lower from the highest is too low.

Can not expect more at a price of Rs.14.300 ( 6 GB +128 GB) in the great Indian sale (Rs 16999 -10% card discount + Rs 1000 Amazon pay cash back).Battery is a real moster but at 6000 mah capacity, the phone is a bit bulky.Camera is just above average and phone is reasonably fast.Go for the phone but expect nothing extraordinary except the battery.

The phone is nice.

The display is wonderful.

Battery is comparatively better, still we can't rely on it that much. If we are using internet, game, camera etc., then it drains out as other phones do. But in normal use, we get more life than other phones. So I will not say the battery life is super, but definitely it is better.

I am having the 4gb varient. It is not working so fast eventhough I have not installed many applications (memory is almost free). I feel a lag in the processing sometimes. I am concerned about what will happen if I start to use more and heavy apps..

Since I am using a Samsung phone for the first time, I miss some facilities I enjoyed in my old redmi phone, like
1)a good inbuilt music player
2)Showing the network connectivity speed in the status bar
3)unavailability of missed call imformation in the lock screen. (We have to unlock the phone and then launch the 'Phone' application to know who had made the call).
etc.

Heating is there. A phone with this much memory and processor and also having an amoled display, I didn't expected that. But it can't be considered as a major issue as it is not severe. Still, it is there when you use camera or internet for long time.

Camera is excellent in day light photography. The video quality and dim light operations are not that excellent.

Though these problems exists, I enjoy the phone. I suggest a normal phone user to go for it, as the problems I mentioned will not affect them, and the quality of display, sound, camera etc. in this price will definitly make you love it.

Writing review after 20 days of usage
Got this phone in festive season offer. Phone is good overall but it could be better.  I have found few pros and cons which is below.

Pros:
Screen: very good amoled screen. This kind of display found in premium class of Samsung phones but gorilla glass protection is missing.

Battery: Massive 6000 mah battery with great backup.

Weight: phone is feels light weight with 6000 mah battery.  Weight  management is done very well.

Grip is very good so that you can use it without back cover.

Cons:
Camera: It doesn't have EIS. Sharpness is missing in photos. Details missing. Tough it has 48 MP camera, photos looks like 8 MP camera. Samsung needs to work on camera software.

Fingerprint: Fingerprint should be faster than this.  It takes around 1 sec to unlock screen.  Other mobiles are faster than Samsung.

Internet reception is very poor. It works good with continuous usage but it drops reception if you leave for long time. To get it back, you need to turn on and off flight mode.

Lag: Samsung inherited its lagging in this phone as well.  Despite of having 2.3 Ghz processor, phone lags while multi-tasking.

Software improvements are required in this phone.  It doesn't even have spam call blocking facilities.

Excellent phone.
one star less give bcoz not provide TPU case &amp; earphone with box if they provide with this,is gonna perfect phone this price.
Phone running very smooth, battery life is Monster as they mentioned in title. Various cool features are interesting,easy and usefull.Most best thing is dolby vision sound shortcut feature are given which is nice experience with earphones. Display gives excellent color enhancment (not talk about Samsung's display bcoz no doubt everyone knows Samsung mobile=Awesome Display quality ).
Only 2 thing is worst in phone one is phone heatad after long (continuous 2 hrs) playing some high graphics game (like PUBG,Asphalt, Fortnight,COD). So This phone is not for game lovers &amp; second is CAMERA coz they said its 48MP but actually it gives very low photos if u see with zoom which is not gr8,I expect more from M30s camera but this price we have to compromise some things.
Overall This phone is for those who traveling lots, music loves (Movie with dolby vision sound👌🏼👌🏼), Need beautiful Display quality,Long term use.

One of the worst product of Samsung. Don't get deceived by the positive user ratings. I bought 6 Gb/128 gb variant. Within 2 days, i faced the network issue. Inserted 2 sim cards. Both will be out of coverage. No incoming calls and no data. I am living closer the cell phone tower. My other number at home will work perfectly fine which has the same network. If the mobile gets disconnected with network, it will not connect again, wherever i travel with the phone. The only way to make it work is that i have make a call to any number.  This problem becomes so frequent. I returned, after technician inspection to Amazon and got a same replacement mobile. And again i faced the same issue as before. Worst product from Samsung. Network download and upload speed is very less when compared with other mobiles. I have been a Samsung user for the past 10 years. Disappointed. Got rid of this phone and started using Redmi Note 8 Pro, with the same set of SIM cards and it is working without any issues.
Note: Few of my friends using M30s 4/64 gb variant and they face no issues.

This is amazing  phone and it battery  is very longer as write. You should by it . It's fingerprint reader was also good and camera quality is very fantastic. If you want to buy good phone under Rs15000 it is best option. It aslo  has fingerprint  readers that is very fast  and camera quality is also very good because  in Rs1400 if has 48 mega pixel  camera that is amazing and its battery was also  very longer and you can we this phone for about  one day continously when it is fully charged. I will advise you to buy it

This phone is scrap only and nothing else. I had never expected a third class phone like this from Samsung. It is very slow working. It responses after tapping several times for a single task e.g. if you have to disconnect the call you have to tap on end for five six times. A very low grade phone on such higher price of 14k. Even a 5k price phone can work better than this. My strong advice not to spoil your money in buying this cheap quality phone.

- Value for Money: Best value for money device in mid-range phone segment.
- Display: No words to admire the Super AMOLED Full HD+ display, just perfect.

Cons:
- Camera: It is slightly poor in low light compared to its rivals.

Photos come black, and some round black spot comes on face. Especially when in bright light, photos suck. Battery dies in 12 hours of normal use with minimum apps running. Though they sell telling 6000. Waste buy, review after a month use.

I could say that this is a proper budget phone with more features that what is expected. Samsung has done a really good job with the M30S. Ofcourse I hoped for a Snapdragon processor. But as far as I've used, the speed is not a problem here. Battery is just mind bogglingly active! Charged it 100% and literally got if for 2 perfect days! Also hoped for Aluminium Body or glass back atleast

Working fine, battery performance is quite good,i expected much more better camera performance but it's worth for the price,
Snapdragon processor also performs very well in this phone. We can play pubg for 4.5 hours continuously the battery percentage drops by only 30% - 40%
The operating system which this phone runs on is Samsung one UI which is one of the drawback of this phone due to which I was getting a lot of advertisements and pop ups in the phone whenever I used to go for chrome browser, I also expected the Samsung bixby feature to be on this device but its ok we are managing with Google assistant! Over all on the display and the device is Great

amazing phone..i am writing this review after using this phone for 5 days and right now i dont have any issue with the phone .the camera is amazing (specially rear one) .battery backup is too good with light usage it lasts for almost 2 days and with heavy usage it lasts for almost 1.5 day and it gets fully charged in almost 2 hours which is good for a 6000mAh battery . and phone doesnt lag. and for those who are confused in colour white and sapphire blue. Blue is the better option.And one last thing the phone is way too light than you think. and at last thanks to amazon for delivering it too fast(got it in just 2 days even without prime)

The  best thing about this mobile is its battery life. It is charged in approx 2 hours. After 2hrs charging its battery lasts upto 2-3 days when we use phone heavily. If anyone use it lightly then its battery will last upto 6-7 days very easily.

Its screen quality is awesome. Its contrast ratio is very good and it provides vivid and crisp pictures.

Sound is loud and clear. Dolby enhances its sound experience while using earphones.

Image clarity through primary and secondary  camera is also good. But when we zoom images to a high extent then images becomes blurred and details in images seems missing.

Processsor is also good. I am using it from 1 week but i didn't find any lag.

Fingerprint sensor and face recognition works good. These features unlocks mobile instantaneously.

If you're a movie buff then this mobile is a gem for you because with the help of its 6000mah battery you can wath 4-5 movies easily on this phone on a single 100% charge.

It's totally value for money.

After using it for two months, I'm writing this. The battery is awesome. It easily lasts two days. However, the overall performance of phone is bit slow, be it finger sensor or camera. The picture takes at least two seconds before it gets saved and let you take another picture. The picture quality is at best average. Except for battery life, there are several other phones which score better in this price range.

Pros:
.Awsome display
.Great battery life
.Camera quality is average keeping it in pro as the images hav natural colour which I like personally.
.The ONE UI 1.5 is awesome
.Fast charger included in the box

Cons
.Poor build quality
.The network quality is average
.Finger print reader is too slow

These were the major things I faced using the device for the past 1 month. I would also mention that processor is not great as expected from samsung there were minor lags and multiple frame drops while gaming.
Overall good device.

Reviewing after 10 days of usage,

There are both pros and cons (minimal) of this device but overall a great VFM handset. I ain't a gadget lover but with the gradual usage, I have started liking my recently bought Samsung Galaxy M30s. It has really impressed me a lot on many fronts.

Performance (10 on 10)
The Exynos  9 Octa 9611 processor performs a lot better than the Snapdragon 712 which is fitted on any M30s's nearest competitors. My buying decision was post a detailed analysis and comparison of Samsung M30s 128 GB with Realme XT and Vivo Z1x with M30s. Although, I have not had experience of the later two but I did have experience of a Xiami handset with snapdragon 712 in the recent time . And I did feel the difference during usage. It is very smooth and there is no lag.

Storage (10 on 10)
I preferred to buy a 6GB+128Gm combination and its huge. No doubt about. Its massive.

Camera (8 out of 10)
Impressed but not super impressed. 48 megapixel camera really gives you the details. But low light photos weren't that great. Worth to mention that the front camera has on screen flash, which is really helpful. Attaching few pics taken from the M30s camera for the judgment of the readers.

Battery (08 out of10)
A super Amoled display phone having a humongous a 6000mah battery should ideally last very long as the power consumption by an Amoled display is lot lesser that an IPS LCD display. A fully charged cellphone lasted about a little above 24hrs with full usage. I expected a better performance of the battery (drain post a usage of 2 days at least).

Charging (6 out of 10)
Real disappointment here. Its a fast charging phone but for the namesake only. Takes 3-4 hours to charge the battery completely.

Looks (5 out of 10)
Its a Flop Show here. No premium feel and the black color does not impress (May be, I should have chosen a White one. Looks premium on the photo, at least). A back cover is highly recommended.

Should be the USPs
- Processor - Excellent
- Few dedicated on screen buttons (Video call, Smart View, Always on Display) where you need not to navigate through multiple folder and finally reach.
- Display (I think, one of the best thing to buy this phone is its super impressive, super amoled display)

#not worth

Samsung is not focussing on quality in budget phones.

Pro
Battery &amp; display

Cons
1.Camera -bad in focus and image quality
2. Speed - If you check other phones in same range, you will find lot of apeed issues in this phone.
3. Network - reception is very bad.  Testing in other M30s also.

Verdict - Even I am a Samsung lover but still I moved from M30s to other phone. If basic functionality like network reception is a issue, then its purpose is not only met.
Check out other alternative in the market in tge same range.

First of all, kudos to Samsung for designing such an amazing phone at a cheap price. This phone is indeed an all rounder in all aspects. Let me sum up my review with the pros and cons...

Pros:
1. Super Amoled screen:
Amazing Display quality and viewing angles. Just loved the display provided by Samsung. Very immersive experience. If media consumption is your top priority then this phone will not depress you.
2. Monster 6000mah battery:
Indeed this phone lasted me for more than 2 days with light usage scenarios. Overall great battery backup. Also there's 15W fast charger in the box so that's an added advantage in charging speed.
3. Performance:
With exynos 9611 inside, the performance was pretty solid (like a monster). Multitasking and ram management was also a breeze. Playing high graphic games like pubg would be easily playable under high settings.
4. Camera:
It houses a triple camera setup to the back. One 48MP shooter, one 8MP wide angle shooter and one 2MP depth sensor.  The front camera is a 16MP shooter. Overall it shoots some great looking photos with good detail and sharpness.

Now, however this phone excels in every aspect, there are still some minor cons present with the device which i want to share.
1. Camera:
Although the camera quality is pretty great but still the quality of the image is not as expected.  Specially the 48MP shooter shoots pictures which are not that detailed as compared with other competition. Also the front camera is little poor in capturing good lighting and detail of the subject under certain scenarios. However there's nothing much complain about the cameras  and for this price it is still killer.

Hence, my final verdict. If ur budget is strictly under 14k and you want great battery backup and performance then surely go for this phone, you will not be mistaken.  However if your budget is little higher and camera is your main priority then I suggest you go for other competition which offer much better value for money.

As for me, i am extremely in love with this phone. Thank you Samsung

This phone is good at this price. I will write cons first then Pros.

Cons
1. Speaker volume is low compared to other phones especially compared to low cost MI phones.

Pros
1. The phone display clarity is awesome ,
2.battery once charged will last for a day on reasonable usage. .
3.Camera is good however 48 MP looks overrated for the clarity of pictures it gives. (Especially when u expect from Samsung 48 MegaPixel)
4.Finger print sensor is quick

Bluetooth is horrible. Its disconnecing with in 10 seconds after playing music on my LG Boom Box. And this phone started  hanging while connecting. Want to return this worst phone of Samsung.  One more thing..Fast charging  they are saying but it's taking much time charging than  a regular phone. I am not happy at all.😒

They packed this cellphone in a desert area. The freshly removed cellphone was covered with duat. It has patches color issues plus the box was actually damaged. The cellphone works fine but the dust makes it look like it's a refurbished product some how even if it's new to date. Poor packing quality from Samsung. Even last time I bought an A50 it had the same problem the box was not damaged so I kept it this time it was damaged so I have returned it. Samsung India your quality guys are a sleep an they are useless.

This review is after almost a month of usage.

1. Since the time Samsung announced the 6000 mAh battery, I stalled my purchase to wait for this phone. Bought the phone majorly for the battery life, as I am a traveller and heavy GPS user. Must say I was not disappointed. Totally happy. Charging time is also OK, although not very great, but with the lare battery, one should expect the time it takes to fully charge. Takes almost 3 to 4 hrs.

2. Camera quality is good in this price point, but not the true 46 MP quality you might expect. I am still happy, as I wasn't expecting a great deal at this price, and the phone matches my expectations.

3. Finger print reader is too good. Instantly unlocks the phone.

4. Processor and memory are plus too. Never had any issue of phone hanging allthough I have good numbers of heavy apps installed on the phone.

5. Sound quality is good. Media sound is loud enough to play songs and videos.

6. Phone heating is not a problem. Sometimes it happens, but I think it is because of some app issues which I need to figure out. It doesn't seem to be a phone issue.

7. Amazon delivery was amazing. I got it one day prior to the launch itself due to prime membership.

The phone is as advertised, a Battery Monster. It is what it says on the cover. Don't expect top of the line performance, it is good but not chartbuster. What is Chartbuster though is BATTERY LIFE.
If you want serious Battery Life on a budget and with decent enough performance, this is the phone to get.

Every feature of the mobile is decent and at the same time it's average.
Sound and Battery backup is good but overall performance is average.

Lack of screen smoothness.(bit laggy sometimes)
Camera's picture quality totally depends upon lighting of the surroundings.
Back cover looks good however doesn't feels good in holding.
Figure print scanner is fast and charging speed is also quite impressive.

overall - 7/10

The best thing like the name suggest its battery that is really monster.
Display is good but i have seen a series devices have better quality display than m30s.
Display is yellowish that is bad point.
Processing speed is good.
Ram must be 6gb i purchased 4gb varient.
Camera is as good as they say 48mp extreme level.

One of best monster mobile phone I brought, Quality n specification at this price point makes neighbors envy. Full HD oled display, battery for whole 4day, smart UI, n lot n lots of option, feature.... Samsung M30S is way to go n buy......My honest opinion is "This phone is amazing for the price I paid." yes there are other phones out there in similar or higher specs for the same price range but the sAMOLED screen with 1080p resolution is no match. Plus the software is super smooth in the last two days of usage, I found no lag or slowness. I bought this during the sale and installed all the apps that I use regularly. Played these games without any trouble or lag, like PUBG and Call of duty, which is another big plus.
Obviously there are some downsides, camera is not great and it auto glorifies the photo in a non realistic way but I believe it can be turned off or may be updated by software upgrades. The phone is a little heavy but I know this when I bought it as it has 6000mah batteries (what should I expect?).
Anyways there are loads of positive things than couple of negatives which I am happy to accept (remember I spent ~11700). Nevertheless this is an over 5 star phone for the price.
Pros:
sAMOLED screen with 1080p - 5+⭐
11nm super fast speedy processor - 5+⭐
Samsung one UI software - 4.5 ⭐
Fast charging with 15w - 4.5 ⭐
Lightweight with 6000mAh battery - 4.5 ⭐
Finger print reading and location - 4⭐
Price of the phone - 5⭐

A very good phone at low budget with high specs. However you cant play games like call of duty even on 6gb version. Had frame drop issue, lag and stutter on other games too.

Camera works amazing.

I use note 10 too. So it would be apples to oranges comparison to this one.

If this is your first high spec phone, it's a killer

Pros:
Long battery life.
Best display there is in a mid range phone (best than Mi, oppo, vivo)
Colour is mid pleasing.
Less heating issues.
Front camera is best than rear one.

Cons:
Rear camera is not giving 48 MP at all.
Can't zoom more than 4x.
They did not include Earphones in the box.

Overall verdict:
A beast of all Mid range phones but the price is a little bit more.

I am using this phone for past 2 months. Performance of the phone is excellent. Comments on specifications are as under:-
Processor/Speed- Rating 5 out of 5 (Excellent performance)
Battery - Rating 5 out of 5 (Excellent performance)
Camera quality - Rating 4 out of 5 (Performance is very good). But as the camera is of 48 megapixel, better quality was expected.
Other functions/Sensors - Many useful sensors are provided
Overall this phone is excellent in this range.

I'm posting this review after using 2months of m30s mobile.

1. Display is pretty good. I like it very much. 5/5

2. Processing speed is very good then redmi and realme mobiles. 5/5

3. Rear camera is very good in day. But in night time it is an average one. 4/5
Front camera is average only 3/5.

4. If you are not playing games battery will come up to 2.5days.
When playing PUBG or Call of duty discharge time is less.(not like 6000mah) battery. 3.8/5

5. I didn't feel any heating issue when playing high graphics  games like call of duty. 4/5

6.Fingerprint reader is not working properly in sometimes. It could be improved.3/5

7. If you are charging mobile night times. You can turn off fast charge option.

8. Less weight for 6000mah battery.

Finally M30s is a very good mobile for this cost. You can feel better experience in playing games and videos.
This is a best budget mobile.
Overall rating is 4/5.

Screen- 10/10 ( Amazing )
Sound- 7/10 ( Not so loud but sund quality is good and you get Dolby Atmos which can better your earphone sound)
Camara- 8/10 ( Back camara is really good and slow motion vedio made by this phone is great but super steady mode is too bad when you use it, vedio quality will be decrised. Front camara is quite good)
Fingerprint- 8/10 ( It works good but little bit slow...little...)
Face unlock- 8/10 ( Good)
Processor- 9/10 ( Good still i face no issues and there was no hitting problem, ya after heavy gaming phone willbe little hot but this is ok)
Network- I'm not giving any rating because i felt no issue but network bar never showed full tower when the other phone shows full. I don't know it's a software or hardware issue.
Battery- 10/10 (6000mah battery is really good. For heavy use 1.5-2 days, normal use 3 days easily.)
Fast charger- 10/10 ( Out of the box you get fast charger which is great and charging speed is also great)
Built quality- 5/10 ( Built quality is not so good .Samsung not mentioned which glass they used in this phone and the back panel plastic quality is really bad and It's so thin.)

This phone is good but in this price segment i expect more. I got this phone in offer (Rs.12,400) so I'm quite happy with this. This is spatially a great phone only for Samsung lovers.

I had a dilemma of buying realme 5 pro or Samsung Galaxy M30s. But finally I chose Samsung, and I am glad. The biggest spec I like is 6000 mAh battery. If you are a mild user, not using games, then it will work almost 3 days, a heavy user can use it for 2 days in a single full charge. For a test, I charged it 100 % and used it till it switches off automatically. It worked beautifully even in 2% battery( more than 30 minutes). Lets see what happens when it gets old. Any phone works good when its new. Camera is fine. Fingerprint is a second slower than Mi and Realme phones. sAMOLED display is the main thing which distinguishes it better than other phones. It shows more beautiful clear colors, specially black, than LCD screens. It feels awesome to touch the sAMOLED screen while navigation.
The hardware of phone is cheap, plastic material. But feels good when you carry it, as its lighter phone despite having massive battery capacity.
After 10 days of using this phone, I have no objection over its performance, I played Call Of Duty Mobile efficiently.
The Exynos processor works smoothly.
Camera clicks really good 48 MP pictures, but still it needs better pixel density. It does not make a crow a swan like oppo phones do. But if you like pics as originals, without or with some slight effects and filters, my friend grab the monster.
The charger is OK,  15 W is slower for 6000 mAh battery, it charges the phone full in about 2.5 hrs. It would have been better if 18 W or more provided.
Then too, at this price range, what more can you expect?

Above all, you get only a phone, sim ejector pin, a charger adapter with USB Type C cable with some paperworks inside the product box. Dear Samsung, thats so rude.
No back cover or screenguard provided, its called Kanjoosi.
Depends on what you need in a phone, I needed massive battery capacity in a phone, as I reside in such place where electricity supply is not good. So its a good phone for me.
The reason I am giving it 4 star is because of its non-premium hardware, meagre 15 W charger, and non- availability of accesories.
Remember one thing, Phones do get old now in just one month, so I will not recommened you to buy it 3 months later.

The best phone battery backup to keep the phone alive for approx 1.5 days with all application on.
The product quality is superb includes body, display and performance, battery life and user interface.
Nice to face this product handy for everyone.
The only area, the improvement required in this phone is Camera part.
The camera picture quality and settings are not impressive and lacks crisp resolution and focus in the image.
The image quality is not satisfactory and requires improvement.

It is not a good phone.Network problem is the main issue in this phone.
Samsung need to resolve this issue.
I have one redmi phone also, when i put my sim in redmi, network is ok, but when i am using m30s then network issue is there.
It is a very big issue, samsung need to resolve it otherwise it will become big impact on future market.

I found the product very good in price range of 25k also no phone is having features like this phone,
Since samsung galaxy note 01 am using samsung note series, and also for my family I chose samsung brand whether it is smart phone or smart tv, samsung as the brand has a caliber to deliver the required satisfaction to the customer.... atleast to me,
Samsung M30s I brought for my family member and am satisfied and got value for money at this crunch economy times.
Thanks Samsung.

Battery: l'm really happy with battery. I use this for 48 hours with medium usage including WiFi and GPS.

Camera: The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots. Additional zoom-out features for both front and rear camera is nice to have

Design, Touch, Look &amp; Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light.

The face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock. The processing speed is good enough for heavy games without much heating effect.
Good processor.
I LOVE IT

This M30s is the best budget phone of 2019.
Quick review of M30S after usage of 1 week.
-

-Display: (6.4 inch) 2340×1080 FHD super Amoled display
-Battery: It comes with a powerful 6000mAh battery and supports quick charge (15W).
-Fingerprint reader: Quite fast &amp; it has face unlock feature which works fine even in a low light condition.
-Camera: 48+8+5 triple camera (rear), 16MP (Front). Takes decent  pictures.
-Processor: It comes with Exynos 9611 octa-core processor, 2.3GHz.
-Gaming: Supports PubG with HDR graphics.
-The phone Supports HD games without any lag (Depends on internet signal strength) and its 6000mAh battery provides enough backup for any HD games.
- It takes almost 2.15hrs to charge  from  0-100% which is very decent  for 6000mAh battery.
-----------Don't think twice &amp; just go for it!----------
SAMSUNG M30S!

Average camera - daylight photos are good, night photos are grainy and lacks clarity even with night mode. Good for only selfie and daytime photos. Battery life is good compared to other phones in this range.
About Display size - width of the phone disappoints compared to the length of display. Not so great phone to watch movies. Multitasking is smooth, but gets heated up under low network reception and when playing games.

It's been 15 days that i am using this phone and i am having an amazing experience with it. The best things about this phone are it's display and it's long battery. It's amoled display gives amazing colours and immersive viewing experience and it's battery last upto 1.5 days.
Some issues on which samsung should work on this phone are
1) fingerprint sensor is little slow and i think this problem would be solved with an update.
2) As exynos 9611 is a new processor so it's battery usage is not fully optimized so you don't get the best experience of your 6000mAh battery.

The camera of this phone is also very good and its screen optimizer function also helps in taking amazing shots.
So overall i would like to say this phone is amazing and you should go for it.

Over all it is very good phone in this price range. Most of the specifications required for seamless gaming are there. Battery is good. One full charge gives one full day even location and data is kept on. Camera quality is okay. The pictures in 48 MP are sharp. The pictures taken using multiple cameras like live focus images, wide angle images are not that good. Normal pics with main camers are very good. Night photos also looks good. Samsung displays are always better. Overall this phone is very good within budget and performance.

Fingerprint sensor is awesome it takes just 2 seconds to open
Camera is really good
Battery life is very good but takes almost 2hrs to full.
6 gb ram and 128 gb memory really good no need of extra space.
But while playing heavy games it lags a bit. But for general works it is the best in market. And Samsung provides updates whenever needed customer service center also available all over India. So just go for it.

This is probably the best phone you can get under 13k (after bank discount) .
The Display you get is one of the best and it looks gorgeous because its an Amoled display with pitch dark blacks.
The camera is really good in daylight shots and the wide angle lens adds a new perspective never seen before in this price segment.
The finger print scanner is very fast but is not at its full potential because of a large animation time (which can be improved via a software update).
The battery life is insane, gets me through 2 days with good amount of usage.
With a good and optimised update the m30s will be a king in this segment.

Overall the phone is excellent and value for money and would recommend it to people who mainly want a ultra wide angle camera and a super long battery life.

Pros.
1. Balltery is fantastic. It last almost for 1.5 day.
2. Camera is decent. Capture good pictures even in low light.
3. It comes with super amoled screen which is very crisp and clear.
4. Fingerprint scanner is very responsive.
5. Value for money. I bought it for 12.5k in great indian sale at Amazon and it worth for every penny.
Cons.
1. Processing speed is slow. It lags sometimes.
2. Its bulkier than other phones of A series. Its mainly because of its 6000Mah battery.

I am using this mobile since last week. As per my opinion this phone is good and i have not faced any problem since i have purchased. Speed of the phone is good. I am normal user and for me battery work for 2 days easily. I am little bit disappointed  with camera of the phone and display glass used. Camera  photos  in day are good but in night doesn't  work well. Initially i used this phone without extra glass protection. I was surprised despite of all care glass got hair line scratches. Display  wise it is excellent but it appears that glass used by Samsung on account of cost cutting is not good. If Samsung has used good quality of glass it should have beat even premium  mobiles. If you have decided to bought u can but use tempor glass and also take screen  damage protection.

When a mobile comes with 3 cameras (one with staggering 48MP in such budget), you would expect it to use all the cameras at all times depending on your choice of shot.  But that is not the case with the M30s

The Samsung M30s gives you the best of both worlds within its budget. You have the massive battery (Bought this for my mom and she just charges it once every other day for full). Then you also have the good 128 GB storage. I added another 64 GB to it because my mom runs appareals business and needs more storage for her product images.

For that part, the device is smooth, very satisfactory and infact more faster in performance compared to her not so old Oppo F7  (6GB+128GB). Given that both these phones have the same memory specs, the galaxy M30s clearly won because of its superior chipset and incredibly low price.

While the performance is smooth, the fingerprint is very convinient, I'd like to come back to the camera.

As I've mentioned before, all the cameras do not work simultanously for videos. For instance, I pick the long shot and it switches to the bigger camera and the wider lens, for nearby, it goes for the smaller camera and the near lens.

But when I tried shooting video, it only picks any one camera. I cannot switch or zoom in using the far camera and only can do so with the smaller cameras.

Bottom line, if you are buying this to shoot professional shoes or something, maybe not go for this.

But if you are looking for a budget device with faster performance (gaming and what not), neat pictures and occasional videos and massive storage and massive battery, go for this. No doubt in performance or device strength.

Excellent
For this price segment this phone is a killer .
For a normal usage we get a battery for atleast 3 days
For heavy usage 1.5 days

Pros :
Camera quality
6000 mah battery
Finger print and face unlock
No lag

Cons:
Due to 6000 mah battery atleast they should have went for 25 W fast charger rather than 15 W which is taking much time to charge..
But still considering the price segment this phone deserves more than 5 stars ....
Best phone from Samsung to make MI oppo vivo all this China made brand quite..

The M30s is really the best Samsung could offer in a mid-range smartphone in today's world of competitive state between mid-range smartphones. Yes, it turly is 'Monstrous' when it comes to the battery life, you can literally keep bingeing and worry the least about your phone's battery backup.
The 48 mega-pixel triple-rear camera setup is the best for photos clicked in broad daylight as the pictures blemishes with contrast and saturation. The night mode is quite bulky when it comes to automatic shots, but I feel that pro mode could help differ the bulkiness.
Videography at it's best with this smartphone as it supports 4K recording with the best and special stabilization a mid-ranger can offer. Slow motion videos can be captured in 240FPS and in quite a decent quality in natural lighting.
There are more features regarding the camera built into the software which includes editing options the phone offers like you can edit the blur even after when you've clicked a photo in 'Live Focus' mode and also while you're clicking it. There's another option to adjust a telephoto in 'colour-point' where the subject of the photo remains in it's natural colour and background changes into black and white. It's a very basic and interesting studio feature this smartphone offers. The coloration of this feature lives quite up to the mark with all the edges and structure of the subject covered with precision.
The second highlight (after the monstrous battery back-up) of the phone is the display that the Korean Gaint offers in this phone which undoubtedly makes the phone remarkable. Yes, as you already know, a SuperAmoLED display. It brings all the colours to life with it's outstanding vividness and contrast qualities so you cannot miss any of those details while you're watching Netflix's 'Bard of Blood.' Also the phone offers Dolby's 'Dolby Atmos.' For the best sound deliverance anyone could ever expect. This phone never runs out of juice and yet you get the best video and audio quality while you're bingeing, what more can one ask for in this price range of 15,500 bucks from Tech-Giant that mainly produces high-end smartphones and other devices. Now, as Samsung setting foot in this competitive market of producing some of the best phone's we've ever seen in the segment, proves them all wrong and takes the market with storm.
Now, after reading all the above, if you're still thinking something like, "what speed could 4GB of RAM with 64GB of internal storage provide me with at this range?" Or something like, "is this smartphone fast enough for everyday multitasking?" You needn't worry at all, with the Exynos 9611 octa-core processor clocked at 2.3GHz to 4 cores and at 1.7GHz to the other 4 cores, you should really be worry-free about the speed and smoothness of this device.

This is a detailed review for the Samsung Galaxy M30s with 4GB RAM and 64 GB internal storage (expandable upto 512GB) with dual SIM and a dedicated slot for Memory Card.

I liked everything about the M30s especially the positive hype about this phone on social media. Almost all experts reviewed that it is a good phone to go for. Also it is just perfect to the word monster described for its humungous battery size. It has the best battery in its class and has a successful M series launch especially with the millennials. It's truly a beast and I am looking forward to enjoying my Samsung M30s. The amoled screen is just super and the phone size is just perfect. The bezels are minimal and the look is simple and appealing for professionals. The triple camera is more than enough for storing memories in its huge 128 GB memory. The triple slot is also a step further should you need extra storage and using two volts sums together. I was excited about using the special features like night mode, always tap on, shortcuts for media and devices, Dolby atmos, blue light filter and smart mode to name a few. To top it up, it was fantastic to see Amazon promote this Samsung phone with a Rs 1000 cashback offer over and above the 10 percent cashback offered by SBI Bank. Truly a value for money offer.

Very  original concept phone ,camera  quality  makes dslr camera look like childs toy, screen comes alive by it's super amoled  display, just feeling pity for myself for thinking that I had the ultimate  view of screen experience which was shattered  by Samsung  Galaxy  m30s, and battery  lasts forever even  after  heavy usage, Samsung  has raised the standard  of mobile so high that even top flagged mobile  companies  are finding it hard to describe  their products  which  seems like junk in comparison  of  m30s, overall I am not very easily impressed  but you broke that boundaries making me go nuts whenever  I pick Samsung  Galaxy m30s any time much better than China products. Hats off to you guys you nailed it

Nice product from Samsung. Excellent for normal usage and casual gaming. Rear cameras are also good.The best part is the battery backup. And most importantly, it is SAMSUNG - Manufactured in INDIA.

Pros:
1) Battery: You can easily get a screen on time of 11-12 hours which translates to 2-2.5 days for practical daily use. It takes 2 hrs and 30 min to fully charge from 0 to 100, which is good considering the monster 6000mah battery of this phone.
2) Display: Just one word - awesome... Samsung super amoled displays are the best. Period.
3) Very low SAR value
4) Crisp and clear call quality and earpiece.
5) One Ui interface is simple and full of useful features. The Night mode is simply amazing.
6) Rear cameras: Good rear cameras. Pictures have natural colors and have enough detail. The 48 mp mode is also great. The wide angle lens is also excellent in this range. Super steady mode in video recording is also pleasing. Slow mo videos are also quite good.
7) Device ergonomics are on point.
8) Decent processor for daily usage, multitasking, and casual gaming.

The only issue is:
&gt; Selfie (front) camera: Images are a bit soft and lack detailing. Hope this improves via a OTA update.

I have been using this mobile for a few months now. Love the camera. Unfortunately the mobile fell on glass and developed a crack. There are lot of unnecessary apps preinstalled in the phone which are a nuisance. The phone has good battery life and charges fast. I am satisfied with this phone.

Network signal is showing only 1 bar continuously in the M30s, but when putting the same SIM card in other phones, the signal strength is full. Battery is supposed to be 6000mah but due to the signal issue, is draining very quickly and doesn't even last one day. When trying to replace/return an obviously defective product, Amazon is making even high-value Prime customers jump through hoops. After 3 calls to customer service, they finally scheduled a home visit from a technician. Technician ran third-party app to check signal strength, which was extremely low. He took screenshots and told me to contact Amazon to arrange a return/refund, but when I called them, Amazon is saying that the technician marked the issue Resolved! What utter nonsense! Now they've scheduled another home visit for the following day.

Update: Second technician saw the phone and escalated the matter. Amazon has arranged a pickup and refund. Thanks to amazon customer care for resolving the issue finally.

I think the fingerprint is quite on the slower side, camera is fun, i sound and vibration feels good, little overpriced but i really wanted a phone with good battery life. 6000 mAH along with fast charging is the best feature for this phone by far. I have had this phone for a month now and i am very satisfied from this samsung device .Only thing i would like to see if the battery support lasts after a year of usage, which you can never expect from Chinese manufacturers. This is the only reason i have bought Samsung phone and see if there's any difference in battery performance after a year or they are all the same.

The phone died in 1 day. Didn't charge, showed no power. Actually it took me more time transferring my data compared to the time the phone was on. Tried different cable/charger but nothing. Even went to Samsung service center and they confirmed its dead but didn't help as the purchase was from Amazon. The Amazon team being Amazon team is still trying to figure out but can't trust this model. In order to compete in low price segment, they have cut down on the quality big time.  On paper this phone looks a great buy but it is on paper only.

Got this product on 8/10/2019 11:30am. Camara quality is not at all good.
Trying to raise replace request but it's not working as amazon want to do phone inspection through a backwash app which is getting hang. And app is not getting connect to amazon server, not satisfied with amazon service and mobile as well

After using 2 months-

Camera is good but not 48 MP. Its quality is around 18-20MP.  Picture quality and auto focus is good overall. Dont expect zoom quality of 48MP.

Battery performance is above average. Runs around 1.5 days even after good use. Typically equal to phones which have around 4000MaH battery.
In last 2 months it didnt hang in normal use. So performance wise it is more than good.

Looks wise phone is not that great. Plastic use all around make it look like a bit cheap phone. Plastic body is fairly experianced. Seems a bit rough use of phone can physically damage it easily.

In a normal scenario phone is good and can be used. Value for money can be said.

Bettery life is awesome!!
I played pubg,asphalt 9 legend,wcc2 for continusly 4 hours but battery was down only 28%!!
Camera quality is also awesome!!
Rear camera gives us an immersive experience when we use it in daylight as well as night.4k video recording and super steady mode are very good features at this price range!
Speakers volume is decent,not too much loud but it is quite high.
Proximity sensor's sensitivity is little bit lower than usual.
The best part of this phonenis it's display!!!super amoled with full hd resolution gives us supperbb experience.
I think this is best mid range device of samsung and also best in other competitors's mid range devices at this price range.

Amazing phone. One of the best decisions I made. This phone's battery is massive. With moderate usage ( 2 hrs of youtube, 1 hr insta and fb, in between calls, whats app and 3 hrs of pubg😜), this phone had about 60% battery remaining from morning 9am to about midnight.
Charging is also pretty fast.
At first I didnt like the color but i just got used to it... may be later i ll get a back case.
Also I got ACKO screen insurance for 1 yr totally free... isn't it amazing
Would definitely recomend this product.
This is far better than the price i got it in.
Got it in amazon great indian sale+ bank discount+ amazon cashback+ freescreen insurance....AMAZINGGGGG

I bought this phone on the very first day of launch and gifted this to my mom. I haven't used a Samsung device since 3 years when I had galaxy S7, but the specs of M30s caught my eyes.. The moment I received the phone I was already impressed by the display quality. It is top notch...

Coming to the camera quality, luckily I got a chance to try it out on my trip to kedarnath, and this phone did not disappoint at all... The images were sharp, detailed and the phone was blazing fast in focusing and clicking images... The video stabilization is also great here... What I liked the most was the wide angle mode, was quiet handy in clicking group selfies.

About battery, I would say this is the best one can get, as I was traveling, I kept a power bank as well, but didn't even used it once, a full charge lasted for 2 days and the inbox charger was fast enough to top up the massive battery quickly.. Also the weight balance even after a huge battery is great here and the phone doesn't not feel much heavy unlike the other phone with big battery.

Although I bought the 128gb variant, having a dedicated micro SD slot Is a bonus which most of the competitors lack.. Also i haven't experienced any sort of lag or heating issue in 10 days of usage.

I would highly recommended this device to anyone looking for a phone under 15k..

Samsung doesn't live upto the expectations.
Pros:
1. Display is crisp n good
2. Battery is good can last for more than a day for an average usage
3. Camera is ok ok
Cons:
1. Fast charging doesn't live upto the expectations take min 2 hrs for full charge
2. Biggest let of is the WORST Signal reception. I was able to make calls and use internet using my Moto G5S Plus at mist of the places with average network. But unfortunately I can't make calls or use net at most part of the  city with poor audio quality, call dropping etc. I repent for giving away my previous phone.
Someone had put a similar genuine review  which I ignored. So kindly do not buy this phone as it fails to serve the basic purpose of a mobile phone of uninterrupted connectivity  while away from home and work. I have same issue with both Airtel and Jio network and forced to use Wifi instead of mobile data. PLEASE DO NOT BUT THIS PHONE AND YPU WOULD REPENT LATER LIKE ME :(

Like - Specification enriched mobile at competitive prize. As usual, UI of Samsung phones is just user friendly and elegant. Trusted by Samsung brand value. I must admit its awesome features last but not limited to finger print recognition, front &amp; rear camera picture quality, RAM, Processor, Inbuilt memory, Dedicated slot for SD card, prolonged battery capacity, Display quality and what not
Not Like - Common tray for both SIM plus SD card which is nothing but ticklish part, No inbuilt secure folder app and icon on navigation bar

So I have been using this phone for like 8 days and have explored most of its feature
Pros:
1. The Super amoled infinity display: the colors are just superb. Quite a fun to watch dark knight in full HD. And the always on display options with pitch black themes.
2. The 6000mAh battery:  long lasting. Charging speed is good but could have better with Vooc charging. Works fine for 1 whole day which involves Pubg gaming and videos on YouTube for significant hours.
3. Fingerprint sensor: It’s pretty snappy till now. Overall it is way fast than in-display sensors of flagship phones, loved it.
4. The exynox 9611: It is a pretty fast chipset. Played Pubg with HDR and High fps. Got 50~55 fps even after 3 hours of continuous play.
5. Camera: It’s hard to get such a good camera in ₹11K . And the feature of super slow Mo in bright daylight is just fantastic
6. Last and not the least the back. The opal black finish looks pretty decent and standard.

Cons: Not much in this section but some things are important to highlight.
1. Audio output: It could have been a little better. Although output from my  Bluetooth headphones(Infinity[jbl] glide 500)  is quite clear , thanks to Dolby Atmos.
2. Camera interface: Could have been better. Night mode could have been better and easy. You need Iron hand for clear photos at night.

Battery Life is the best feature in this phone. Camera is somehow better and having multiple focus features. Look is super cool and as a brand Samsung is best phone. Having issue with Amazon that with this phone, No back cover given and no earphone. Where Flipkart gives these products with Samsung phones. Network and Speed is also good.

Phone looks good. 48 mp camera sucks  picture quality is of 13 mp camera.my honor 8x takes better picture than M30s, RAM showing system and apps 2.3 GB and available 1.2 GB after cleaning the memory, Although no app is installed other than previously installed. Finger unlock lags.
Amazon delivery is fast and awesome.

Review after a month.
Nice mobile with great battery life. Earlier camera was not upto the mark so as to call 48 MP but with new update it has improved a lot.
Battery life is really good and is one of the reason I bought it.
Pubg can be played with highest graphics without any lagging.
Not faced any heating issue even if using during the Charging.
Dolby Atmos gives very amazing experience if used with good earphone like Jbl, screen quality is awesome.
Earlier I had redmi note 3, which I used for 3 years without a single issue, purchased it through exchange offer and I'm really loving it.
Most recommended to normal users who need budget friendly phone with good features, won't recommend it to people who plans to use it as wedding camera or want camera like iphone.

Pros:
1. Nice display. Super AMOLED
2. Long lasting battery; for my usage 1.5days easily it will last.
3.fast charging. Within an hour,  it will charge 6000mah battery.
Cons:
1. Camera is not that great.  It's kind of 8MP or 12MP. I didn't see the 48MP kind of clarity.
2. Fingerprint scanner is not in screen.
3.most important con is network catching issue. You will not get network with this phone.  Very serious negative point.

If camera were good, this is the best phone in this price bracket.

Using from 2weeks... this is my review.

Ordered this mobile on 1st October and delivered on 5th October. Since it was a great indian festival time delivery was bit late. No problem. Coming to mobile. Design of the mobile is very classy like you feel handing a premium model. Phone is bit weighed due to 6000MAH battery. Back it's a plastic but not cheap. The gradient of the sapphire blue is very classy to see. People have sweaty hands feels difficult to use. 6000 mah battery is a blaster. Kept mobile in charge on Monday morning 6am. Full charge takes around 2.5 hours bit slow only. From 8 am I observed. Took photos, round the clock with fb WhatsApp insta camera etc. Belive me next day night around 11.30 PM charge remains 10%. About camera it's a very decent 48 mp camera. We have to change the resolution 3:4 48MP to get the maximum resolution. But at this resolution the shutter speed lags for 3 seconds to take next pic. This is a negative point I noticed. Front camera was very decent. People who like very saturated outcome picture will not like this camera set. But delivers a very decent natural colorful pics. Wide angle lens doing a great job.
Overall it's a midrange flagship for the people planning to shift to a mobile from 14000 to 17000. Go with closed eyes

It’s really worst product. After working fine one day it’s heating too much and stop working . And Amazon is also not providing to replace or return option . It has written to replace in 10 days but they are not replacing. Amazon has complicated the replacement and return process . To replace it connect to amazon and wait for whole day to talk with customers agent. And end of day you will get sorry there are heavy call please wait wait wait.

Earlier I was using mi max 2. Best mobile all round performance....but the screen cracked when it fell
So I brought this Samsung m30s for the amoled screen
This mobile is just for the amoled screen lovers nothing more is there
48 mp camera is a joke
Rest nothing to write about an average mobile
There are better mobiles out there.

Samsung made the market awestruck with its budget offering M series. And M30s is the don of the M series to be fair. Even with lot of competition the product is doing well in the markets. It has everything to offer with full justice to the price. So let's go to the review.

Pros:
1. Samsung is known for its display. Sporting a full HD sAMOLED display, the phone just glows both in bright and dark parts of the days. Display is the serious factor to consider in this phone

2. The phone is backed by 6000 mAh battery with 15w USB-C Charger. The phone easily lasts for the whole day and no draining issues at all. The Charger is accordingly fast and charges to full in a couple of hrs. Surprisingly, the phone is not heavy and it's elegant to hold.

3. Camera isn't the best but under day light conditions it's fantabulous. Nightmode could've been better.

4. Daily usage and Moderate-to-Heavy gaming is smooth and sturdy. RAM management is good and no lags ever.

5. This phone should be in your wishlist if you are a movie buff or music worm. On the multimedia side, the phone boasts lot of technologies like Atmos etc., and the speaker is Loud yet clear.

Cons:
1. The camera has many effects and modes but not when you are on the 48mp mode. The portrait mode is not good.
If you love mobile photography sorry this phone is not the one for you. Front camera is great and struggles in night.

So there's only one department to complain. The Camera dept. But I hope future updates will fix it.
Yeah there is a promised update to Android 10 so no worries about software.
If you want a powerful and if you're low-key on photography, then this should be the best buy after Redmi Note 8 Pro. Get it for the brand value (after sales service) and overall performance.

8.5/10

All is good except-
Battery after 3 months starts showing fatigue. at end of day its 15% left.
Camera is great.
Major prob is inspite of 8 GB RAM, phone hangs atleast once a week, very irritating.
Bought it to shift from Chinese phones, but this is worse,No option left except the beyond budget Apple.

Well this is the first time I bought the mobile from amazone and looks like I did mistake, and also the first time I am giving 1 star to any product. I have never given below 5 star for any of mobiles which were bought from Fkart. This phone has heating issues with 5 minutes of use. Camera is childish, it's better be a toy for childrens. Don't go on advertisement of this phone and better buy another one ...... I am thinking to return the product. Amazone and Samsung, really bad one from you guys.

Amazing battery life.
Display is good.
Camera is okay.
Fingerprint sensor is sub-par.
Vibration motor is better than competitors.
Speaker is okay. Tinny sound.

Lack of ambient light sensor is a draw back.
Using camera for brightness control uses too much battery.

Samsung galaxy has never been pocket friendly for me until I went through this M series mobiles. It's really an under budget phone for students like me plus this amazing diwali offer of Amazon. Fingerprint sensor works really well and it just unlocks my phone in no time but all the reviews said something different that I watched before buying this product. Anyway the camera quality is superb as we already know this is one of all Samsung phones' plus points. But this camera is much better than the other Samsung phones. The battery is the super long lasting one. It's been almost two days I have used this phone without giving it a little rest except my sleeping time and still I have 24% charge. I'm not a gamer so I think my charge will remain for a long time. I'm happy with my phone.
One thing which I don't like that is there are almost no free stylised fonts. The two I have I do not like them at all. But the favourite ones are not free of cost. Anyway I'll get used to it I hope. Thanks Amazon and thanks Samsung for launching this m30s. I love it.

Got this phone from the big billion day sale. In my short span of usage these are my views
1) The SAMOLED display is really vibrant and the colors are very real and vibrant.The brightness level is also pretty good.
2)The exynos processor is decent and I haven't noticed any lags while using multiple apps at the same time. It's really good at the price point
3)The battery life on this phone is amazing. Lasts about 2 days with a full charge and decent use.
4) The rear camera gives out good crisp images. The wide angle camera is also good but detailing seema a little raw.The selfie camera is average,Feel like it uses some filter and photos are not that good.
All in all , Samsung has put out an amazing product at a very competitive price.This phone will definitely worry the bosses of the competitor brands and establish Samsung in the middle to low budget range again.Cheers

It's been a few days I have been using my new Samsyng M30S and it's been amazing!!! Camera quality is good, processor fast, smooth user interface, love the screen and looks cool. Initially  I did fing an issue with the net connectivity but got it adjusted by managing the sims. But as a personal opinion I thought there were way too many preinstalled apps in it. You guys should loose some. Else it's 5 on 5.
P.s ___Amazon's delivery was superb...ordered it on 28th Sept night 9pm and got it at 8am the next morning on 29th. Really impressed @Amazon. Keep at it!

Two points: -

1. The phone I received was already turned on when I unboxed it. Phone was showing up since 4.38 pm while it was delivered at 5.31 pm on the same day. Attached the screenshot showing the uptime of the phone. This means that the phone is not new.

2. Phone is also making clicking sound on both sides lower body cover. Either it was not properly fitted or it’s body was opened. This has reaffirmed my belief that the phone was certainly not new.

From both points above, I believe, Amazon has not delivered a virgin product. Rest, phone is working fine except the clicking sound on the body.

I raised a complaint for which Amazon has scheduled a technician visit on coming Wednesday (9th October).

Hope Amazon really do something about it.

I’ll update on the same thread after technician visit on the same thread.

It means it's classy movie experience and I share my personal video last night at airport and look at this superb stabilization and angles and  its superb actually I am a photographer and pre wedding videographer and editor so that this is a super phone for me because it 6000 MH battery it's long long video editing experience and display experience it's a different in this price point.
If you want to buy a phone in brand then I suggest please buy this phone because it's a superb budget phone in high configuration like 48 megapixel camera it's superb on this price. Thank you so much Samsung.

I was looking for a good camera phone thats why i choose Samsung M30s. After using it for a month here are my views.
Pros
1. Camera quality is superb with different mode available for clicking pic like best shot, vide angle shot, also pics in night and dark are also good with fflash option.
2. Battery life is good. I am not a continuous user of phone, use it only for 1-2 hours hardly in a day. So as per that i can say battery life is ok.
3. Fingerprint scanner is good. However when other brands are offering on screen finger scanner.
4. Video recording quality is awesome and with many modes like live focus, slow motion, ultra slow motion, still video you can experiment too.

Cons
1. Its heavy, beleive it as compared to other brands its very heavy. U can use for zyming also. Just kidding. But really, its really heavy.
2. Camera night mode is giving blurred images. Here i mean the speacialy provided Night Mode of camera. It works without flash. So the image quality is not as good as compared to pics clicked with normal camera mode in night using flash.
3.As usual, samsung phone gets slow with time. Even with 6 GB RAM, its behaving like a 3/4 GB RAM mobile.

Hope these points will help you. I will add more points in future.

I would advice you not to spend on this Phone as the Phone will start heating on 3 to 4 minutes of use , either you make a call or surf the net or put on charging, the Temperature reaches to 30 Degrees on 3 minutes of use as checked by Samsung Service Center guys, I wanted to return this Phone but since I was out of Town could not return it during the return period, Amazon support guys are totally useless they just read out Policies of the Company when you speak with them, I spoke with Samsung went to their Service Center as well, they just flashed the Phone and again its the same, so better don't spend your hard earned money on this Phone

Phone is overall  good and smooth in functionality.  Very lucid touch. It feels the touch of premium phone.  Keeping in mind the price and brand  it's a best budget phone under 14000. People are  complaining  about  camers. But the fact is camera is also good  perhaps you need to explore the correct  directions, light source etc. All applications  load super fast and works glitch free. Phone unlocks instantly  with  face lock and finger print sensor. Battery back is good considering the  phone AI system to adapt the screen resolution according to environment light conditions.  Phone is purely made in India. And the last plant of Samsung is going to be shut down in China. So we must encourage  Samsung. Earlier I used MI phones which are specs wise good but durability  wise poor. Always struggle with spares like power buttons, battery , and third class service  center representatives.

I love this phone and its features for daily use as im a middle class guy now i can take quality images and post in social media .loved itttttttt. I Got Android Pie with One UI 1.5 along with adaptive fast charging adaptor out of the box. Let me share with you my experience;

PROS;
✓✓ Display is Super AMOLED, outdoor display brightness is better than M30,
✓✓ Ultra-wide camera is improved and captures 123 degree
✓✓ Battery is bigger enough to be compared with a battery of MacBook Pro,
✓✓ Phone is lightweight as 188gm while holding a bigger battery with capacity of 6000mAh,
✓✓ Triple camera setup includes a 48mp Samsung GM1 sensor, an 8mp ultra wide angle lens and a 5mp depth. Front camera is also 16mp,
✓✓ It does not have EIS but Super Steady mode is impressive. It can record 4K videos, Super Slow-Mo and Hyper lapse,
✓✓ Type-C port along with a 3.5mm headphone jack provided,
✓✓ Exynos 9611 octa-core chipset based on a 10nm process. Same processor has been used on Samsung A50S which is being sold at higher price by same brand. Performance is smooth and competent for playing games because Exynos 9611 is better than the Snapdragon 665 as per my experience,

CONS;
✓✓ Body is made of plastic which makes it quality inferior and does not give it a premium look like other Samsung phones,
✓✓ Front screen and Back glass are not protected like Corning Gorrila Glass so beware of losing it. (If you have enrolled for Amazon 1 year screen replacement program then fine otherwise AMOLED display replacement can cost you minimum Rs.6k)
✓✓ Processor is power consuming and Battery performance is not upto expectation, even its same almost like M30 as I compared with my brothers phone,
✓✓ 15W fast charging is slow for this giant battery,
✓✓ Small size apertures (48mp cam with an f/2.0 aperture, 5mp with an f/2.2 and 8mp with f/2.2.) capture less light through it. Result average night mode and less blurred bokeh,
✓✓ Front cam selfie lack detailing and seems smoother and Super steady mode does not work on it,
✓✓ No inscreen fingerprint sensor like Mi A3 which is earlier launched in lower range,
✓✓ NFC is no future technology and missing it in a latest phone does make it lack at some point
✓✓ Face unlock is not faster and effective
✓✓ Slo-mo video Flickers in artificial lightening

THANK YOU @ SAMSUNG INDIA FOR DEVELOPING A HIGHLY FEATURED PHONE FOR AN AVERAGE PRICE FOR INIDAN MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE... THANK YOU SO MUCH

Finger print is good.. camera is average. But didn't like battery backup like a 6000 mh battery. I have galaxy on max which have 4000 mh.. after 2 yrs have more better backup than this 6000 mg. So I didn't like this phone's bettery. Front camera didn't has flash, so night selfies not appreciable. Day time pic quality good as expect. Hanging problems not cm. Security gd. Overall sm feature are good sm are not gd. Phone is ok as valuable of money.

INTRO:

Using the 6 GB+128 GB variant of the phone for a while. This is an impressive one from Samsung at this price segment and undoubtedly one of the best power and feature packed phones in this range. Alike all phones, rather everything in this world, it has some pros and some cons too. Here is given a dozen of Pros and Cons what I found from my experience of using the phone:

PROS:

1. Battery is really very impressive, its massive 6000 mAh battery is adequate for 2 days of moderate use. With constant internet enabled (with another phone active with its wifi hotspot) and with moderate calls, gaming, browsing and watching videos, I got a battery charge depletion of 55% in a day (13 active hours and 11 standby hours).

2. Second advantage is its camera. I personally don't give a much score for the Megapixel count as it corresponds to only size of the photograph taken. A camera of 16 megapixel is fair enough, to me, for the size of photograph we see in a screen or print. But the main advantage of M30S camera is its 8 MP Utra Wide Lens which captures 123° and the 5MP depth Lens which portrays depth in the photo. Super Steady Mode, Slow and Super Slow Motion, Hyperlapse, Night Mode, Live Focus and 4K video recording are other feathers in the cap.

3. It has dedicated memory slot and two nano sim lots leaving no scope for compromise.

4. Latest OS (Android Pie) with minimum bloatware and possible update to the next version of OS in due course.

5. SAR value is 0.468 which is fairly good and makes the phone less harmful for long use.

6. The phone is not heavy (186 grams) in consideration of its size and battery capacity, yet remains stable in hand and good for onehand use.

7. Has face unlock feature.

8. In 6 GB memory variant with moderate number of application, nearly 3 to 3.1 GB  remains free most of the time which is good for smooth running of the phone.

9. Dolby atmosphere feature is available to use with a earphone making listening songs or watching movies really pleasing and appealing to ear.

10. No in-screen fingerprint. I find it a pros because in case the screen gets damages, it will not affect the fingerprint sensor.

11. Has wifi calling feature, which enables the user to make calls, where supported, with the help of wifi when there is no or spotty cellular signal.

12. The phone has sAMOLED FHD and Infinity U display making the visuals bright and crispier.

CONS:

1. The first thing that will make the user annoyed is the length of the Charger chord. It is so short that one should make some special arrangements to place the phone while charging unless the plug is just above a table or stool.

2. Another drawback of the phone is absence of notification light, though the phone is equipped with smart pop-up view or Smart alert feature, one has to unlock and check for the types of notifications if Always On Display is off.

3. The processor is better than Snapdragon 665 but the phone specially the earpiece portion is found to be heated during gaming.

4. Though the phone has a type C fast charger, due to its enormous battery capacity, charging will not seem that first in practical. Moreover, it does not have the feature of first 50% charge in initial 15 mins as available in S7 Edge model.

5. It does not have Samsung Knox or the Secure Folder facility, therefore it is less secure than those have it. For safekeeing of files or privacy, one need to install third party applications or dual copy of applications. Only dual messengers (facebook, whtasapp) can be installed in this phone.

6. Sound on speaker is not that impressive. It is rather very good with good quality earphones.

7. Video recording of scenes having bright lights falling on subject is a mess. The camera captures too much of light, thereby loses the hues and colour of the object. Manual white balance is not steady. Depth camera also adds some extra depths than reality and make things look rather stretched than normal in photographs shot at this mode.

8. Screen ratio is lesser than phones of other brands. And the screen is not protected by Corning Gorrila Glass, so one has to use it cautiously.

9. Touch responsiveness is found to be weaker in the sides and corners of the screen.

10. NFC is absent and thats puts the phone behind the league of modern phones.

11. Back cover is of plastic which on one hand bars the phone from looking premuim, and on the other, compromises with the protection of internal parts of the phone.

12. The face unlock feature is buggy sometimes and doesn't detect face properly.

FINAL VERDICT:

There is some cons no doubt, and though the phone is not 5g ready, yet in consideration of the price, the features and functions available in M30S, specially its battery, camera, digital wellbeing, panic mode (calling to SOS number by pressing power button 3 times) etc, it is a very decent buy, with a brand assurance. People who prefers Samsung and plan to buy a decent phone at this price segment, this phone is definitely a recommendation for them.

Reviewing after 7 days usage :

The Box : had charger, type-C cable, sim ejector &amp; the device.

Screen(5/5) :The BIGGEST PLUS for this device is its screen. It's amazing ! Immersive, vivid colors smooth &amp; responsive touch. Sadly no screen protection film is pre-applied on it considering other brands provide it. Nowhere on packaging/website it mentioned that it is protected by gorilla glass, not even on GSMArena.

Battery(5/5) : 6000mAH survived for 2 days, with me shooting some 4k vids, playing BADLAND, Call of Duty, Shadow Fight3 now and then , some browsing etc. Fast charger is provided in the box itself, took exactly 2 hours 31 minutes to go from 4% to 100%

Performance(4.5/5) :No issues in performance, apps popped up instantly, was able to navigate between apps quickly. Fingerprint sensor is blazing fast. Just had a minor lag issues while playing Call of Duty-Battle Royale mode on highest setting-minor lag.

Camera(3/5) : Tripple camera was a disappointment because it was hyped too much.Rear 48MP cam clicks decent shots in broad daylight with considerable detail,  BUT it fails in low-light conditions and shots are pathetic at night. Night mode artificially boosts colors &amp; brightness but  the detailing and clarity decreases. 4K recording was good, stability is provided in 1080p vids but lacks detail. That super-steady mode is good, but when using that mode you loose lot of clarity &amp; details of subjects in the video(kinda hazy). Front cam also shoots decent pics and vids, no complains there. Wide angle camera is also good. Just don't expect too much from that 48MP.

Others : Call earpiece loud enough, speaker - loud &amp; clear, audio recorded through mic also clear and a fingerprint magnet slippery back.

Would I recommend : If you want a daily driver with a beautiful immersive screen, long hours of battery with decent performance and not so very special camera- then definitely yes!

Its a good phone. Finger print sensor is a little slow but that's fine. Camera panorama view stretches the phonto a bit that is fine too when you compare the performance. The battery is good the screen is good. The response is good. Little bit of lag but not much after looking at all the features it provides.  Like game screen recordings.  Call recording. And other.  I have got the system update twice since the purchase. Speaker sound is a little low but the earphone sound work fine. I am happy with the purchase. Looks premium.

I strongly recommend to those who want to gift there beloved🥰 one a phone
Samsung galaxy m30s is best👍🏻
If you want to gift it to your parents, you made a good choice, it got 6.4 inch fhd+ sAMOLED display which helps them to read news articles or watch any videos in high definition and great sound quality which it comes with Dolby sound funtion which enhances your phone's audio and make it much clear.
If you want to gift it to you sister, again you got right, as Samsung m30s got triple rear camera set up i.e&gt; 48 megapixel + 5 megapixel + 8 megapixel ultrawide camera with this she can capture the beautiful moments of life not only that it got 16 megapixel front camera which is very helpful to get selfies you know what girls are into it😉
If you want to gift it to your brother then again you did good job, as Samsung galaxy m30s had powerful processor which is Samsung Exynos 9611 which has 2.3 gigahertz and 1.7 gigahertz octa core processor which is very helpful to run any game smoothly
Your thinking about price of this product don't worry Samsung had taken take care about the thing too
The new  Samsung galaxy m30s so budget-friendly that this Dussehra Samsung bringing happiness to home 😍

The smartphone is great
 First I was going for chinese brands like Xiaomi but I bough this from samsung. The mobile is great, camera does the best job in this price range. We can Live focus, shoot 4k video, and the best thing js 960fps slow motion video.

For gaming, the mobile is just good. It runs all modern games like Asphalt 9, Pubg, CoD at the max graphics settings smoothly. Even after 6 hour gaming, the batter was 28 %, which is the best battery life of all smartphones.

Fingerprint sensor and Facelock gives the best security option. The Display is truly good. Its like diving into the ocean of amazingness.

Moreover to provide the best media playback, this phone feature Dolby Atmos. Its not available in any other smartphone in the range. It just gives the best surround sound in headphones and the best 10D audio experience.

I would suggest to buy this phone right away 😄😄

I have been using redmi note 6 pro since last 1 year and wanted to replace phone because of battery.I used to buy products from Flipkart and this time also I searched out this phone from Flipkart,but as I compared rate it was 1500 less on Amazon. My friends told me not to buy from Amazon, but I went against their wish and purchased it from Amazon.Though I faced a little problem in mic Jack and ordered replacement same night.My problem was carefully sought out by Amazon and delivered the replacement within in 3 days.
Now coming to the phone.
Its meet all my requirements
1.Humungous Battery -I use phone extensively for trading and a music lover.full charged Battery lives  upto 1.5 days with extreme uses.
2.Cameras are awesome
3.Display wonder full
4.Smooth working formats

Only one constraint - Samsung should provide Screen guard along with the phone.
Rest ,Best phone .. I love it

I am speechless! The M30s has got a powerful battery that keeps me up for 2 days even with heavy use. It has got a good fingerprint reader that is very efficient and fast. The M30s has a powerful face unlock system. That allows you to unlock your mobile even in dim light area!
The camera has many modes like the super slow-mo, panorama, slow motion, live focus, the wide angle lens and many more. They have done a fabulous job in increasing camera quality.
I loved it! Samsung is the greatest!!!

This is a very bad product...the quality of voice we hear is not clear  and microphone quality is very cheap. Voice calls are very bad...even amazon say that the product is replacable.but i am trying to generate replace request but it is not generating request ..it shows fownload this application to check mic quality. And shows safe.but i am facing the issue and they are just passing the calls to samsung and other departments saying do reset and all. But this options will not improve the voice quality of microphone and calls. Very bad experience.i will recommand that i use my mi phone.and i have seen a huge quality difference in voice. There is no zero option otherwise i will rate it zero star.

Awesome midrange phone from Samsung after a long time,
Pros:-
* Great battery life
* Beautiful amoled display
* Great cameras with video stabilization
* Nice plastic body which can easily be removed for repair work, not like other smartphones with glass body which is not easily repairable
* Very capable processor exynos 9611 which is able to handle most of today's games and multi- taking easily
* Very useful wide angle camera
* Very balanced smartphone in all aspects
* Fast storage with a dedicated micro-sd card slot
* All sensors are their like compass, gyroscope, etc

Cons:-
* Low light camera performance is average, especially in video recording
* 48 mp images takes a little time to save
* Since actually this camera was designed to take 12 mp images (*pixel binning technology), advertising it as a 48mp is not right IMO, 48mp images are not what they are supposed to be, 12mp images are great
* Super-steady mode in camera is not great
* Also super slow motion is only 240fps, with time limit of 2sec, either it should've been 960fps or for 240fps their shouldn't be any time limit

Overall, it's a great phone to have, most importantly a power efficient processor with good performance, nice camera and a large battery is what one need in a ideal smartphone....

PROS:-
1) Good display
2) Best Battery life and back up (if used only when essential it gives upto 3 days on a single charge)
3) Face recognition is good
4) Video Wallpapers and themes are good which makes other people around you to wonder what kind a phone is it
5) Best for normal usage only.
6) Does not hang/ lag and gives you a good quality performence for your routine office work.

CONS:-
1) Camera though 48 Megapixel, quality is like mere 8 Megapixel phone.
2) Finger Print sensor is slow, does not recognize instantly and takes a 2 or 3 seconds to unlock most of the time.
3) RAM althogh 4GB, free space is almost 1.5GB, I don't even have games on it, still it occupies most of the space.
4) Not for Heavy Gamers, it is for normal use.
5) Less options in camera settings.
6) Video quality not upto the mark. 4K is not a quality one.

These were just some pros and cons after 3 months use. The phone is not for gamers and not a camera phone. Although not extensively, i have tested other phones in this price range and almost all phones come with 48MP camera (cheap quality).
Use it as your daily work phone, listen to music, surf the web, watch movies on it or only when essential, the phone will keep you happy with long last bettery performance.

Regards.

Good Morning,

I bought Samsung M30s 6GB 128GB on 28 Sep 19.
Its been 3 months since I have been using this phone and now feel qualified to give genuine reviews about it.

Pros-
1. Screen--The phone has got a biggg screen and very cool to use. The video quality is good and I find it even very handy to watch cricket or any show that I have missed being on the move.
The display is impeccable.

2. Camera--The camera quality is very good. Both front and rear camera clicks lively photos.
Though I have used phone with beeter pictures and more live pictures but in this price range the quality is worth every penny.

3. Volume- The volume of the phone is very good and makes it ideal to listen to videos and songs. The voice quality is clear with no noise or clutter. A clear thumb up in this.

Cons.- Now I would like to draw your attention toward the Cons which I feel Samsung can really improve on with little effort.

1. There were No headphones provided with the phone. This is a surprise a d I feel a complete letdown. This must be worked on and provided even if cost of phone needs to improve by some hundred bucks.

2. Phone takes a long time to charge, which is not a help espe ially with the shortage of time at hand. The battery. Ackup is very good and the phone always lasts more than 24hrs even with continous Internet usage but the charging time should be lesser than current.

3. The length of Charging cord shd be longer. This limits to place where we can charge the phone.

IN THE END I WILL SUM UP TO SAY THAT PHONE IS A GREAT BUY AND IF THE CO S CAN BE IMPROVED BY SAMSUNG THEN THE PHONE WILL DEFINITELY QUALIFY FROM GOOD BUY TO MUST BUY AT THE MEAGWR PRIVE OF 14,500 I GOT IT FROM.

Review after 22 days.

Back to samsung after 5 years, used Mi Notes series. switching to samsung from Mi was with lots of expectation, but still samsung has to do more hard work to keep switched customer for long time due to below concern in M30s,

Speed is still not that much fast when i compare it to Mi Note series, fingerprint &amp; face unlock is not that much fast, build quality is not up to mark, front camera is pathetic even Mi Note 4 - 5 MP camara performs better., To charge bettery it takes more than 2.5 hrs, Network strength is less than others phone i have in my home, speaker is also an average.

Pro....
Im not playing games, so for daily use there will not be any problem. Its Super amoled display is owesome best in market, battery will keep its charger away for atleast 1.5 days, 2+1 slot, weight is decent with 6000 mah battery, super steady mode is nice, Rear Camera is nice .

Conclusion: If you are planning to switch from Mi keep above con. in mind before purchasing it.

<div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R9W1VX1LKKC2Y"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91YEMDtD-bS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A10pvS29cpS.png"/> First of all I am not a huge fan of Samsung phones but the moment I saw the promo featuring 6000 mAH battery , I was blown away and waited eagerly to buy this phone . In fact I may be one of the first customers to order it online on Amazon.
Thanks to Amazon for the ultra fast delivery and I bought the 6GB and 128GB variant and writing this after using the phone for a week.
Honestly speaking when received the phone I was amazed by the sheer look of it coz the phone looked super premium in Sapphire blue color with shiny crystals and ultra stylish and even better than it was shown in the  online photos.
 Pros:
Battery - No need to look at any other features , you can blindly buy the phone for the whopping 6000mAH battery itself . I am charging it on alternate days coz the battery easily last 48hrs after decent usage and charging is also very fast with 15W type c charger and no heating at all .

Camera - If you are photo freak , this phone is for you . It takes stunning photos and what I like specially was that the pics are raw and real not the soft coated ones taken by Chinese ONE (split in to three). It has so many brilliant features that you don't need to take a pic and edit somewhere , you can do it on the go . There is scene optimization in the camera that it automatically detects the location and captures it accordingly . My personal favorite was the super slow mo video capture , the video comes out like what we see in movies ..  The low light photography is superb btw.

Display - The Super AMOLED display is sharp and smooth that every time you touch you feel like you taking a slice of butter and the full HD display is amazing , apps like Youtube Amazon Flipkart open fully on the screen that looks like 3D view . 4K and UHD videos looks vibrant and fantastic. It also has blue light filter for protecting eyes in night.

Performance - No lag on the phone whatsoever and it is super fast. I installed over a 100 apps and multitasking in not an issue at all . The fingerprint sensor and Face unlock are ultimately fast and overall performance was brilliant kudos to the EXYNOS processor.
Dolby Atmos speakers are a BOMB. The playback sound is loud and clear and wifi calling audio also very good ..
Cons
I don't find any negative as of now the phone is mind blowing in every aspect..
The only problem I had is that I have to cover the beautiful stylish back panel with some normal back over just to protect the phone

Overall Samsung has hit the ball out of park this festive season to bring out this ultimate phone with fantastic Camera Battery Display and performance . Getting all of this under 17K is a huge bargain .. Please go for it without a doubt.

I've got the phone on Oct 20. The fingerprint reader works fine. Camera quality is not that much as expected. Battery life is too good.
The thing is my phone's display got shattered in the slightest impact after 10 days of purchase. The quality of the screen built is appalling. It has been given for repair and it's taking too long. So anybody who is purchasing the phone please don't forget to get a tempered glass screen protector as well.

It's been 2months I'm using this mobile,
Pros:
Battery- you can least bother about low charging ∅ battey. Backup is so good.
Diaplay: screen picture quality is good.

Cons:
Camera, it's my biggest disappointment from samsung, lens might be 48mp as they are advertising but camera sensor is not mentioned, but that is factor image quality depends on. My old phone Lumia with  8M.pixel is far better than this. If you are looking for a good phone for clicking photos- please don't buy this mobile.
For me I vote 5star for battery &amp; display. And, It's good for regular use. Don't expect anything special from this.

I decided to finally upgrade my phone after 2 years. After lots of research with around 15k to 20k budget  After research, I finally decided to buy this phone and after the initial 2 hours of usage, it looks awesome. After using this for over a month now I can say, I have already started liking One UI over Stock Android. Clicked a few photo samples and it's more than what I had expected. Glad that I bought this phone.  Here are some advantages and disadvantage with my experience after using over a month:

Advantages:
1. Model color all three colors look fantastic, my brother also purchased it with opal black and I have the sapphire blue both look tremendous  5 stars
2. Camera Performance is much better than other devices comes in this price range and with ultra-wide zoom it deserves 5stars
3. Huge battery backup. I even charge this once at every two days or you can say it last me more than one day and even having huge 6000Mah battery this phone is not very much heavy 5star for this Samsung #GoMonster
4. Display, When it comes to display Samsung always takes the first place compared to other brands I mean when you touch its SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY you found its awesomeness in seconds. A well-deserved 5stars #GoMonster
5. Finger Touch is Quick and Responsive 5stars (very glossy)
6. Back Cover, Even after having a plastic back cover you can say it looks very much premium because of its gradient colors  5stars(very premium quality)
7.Protective glass 5stars
8. Back camera and phone back are of same ground level
9. internal Storage  and Ram are one of the most important factors for me and in this Samsung got 5stars (128gb + 6GB) &amp; (64gb + 4gb)
10. Value for money
11. Most important the Brand, Samsung itself become a huge advantage for me by its service and quality and with this trust, I can say this is the best Smart Phone I ever got at this price range

Disadvantages:
1. It doesn't have the fingerprint sensor on the screen even after having SUPER AMOLED display but it's ok for me, I like the dedicated fingerprint sensor it's quick and responsive.
2. Plastic Back cover but again it doesn't make much difference because all the back cover looks fantastic because of its multi gradient color.

Final few words:
This is the best mobile phone in this price range with a brand trust like Samsung. So, in my opinion, go for it you will never regret.

Cheers,

I would go point by point and try to cover almost all main feautures.
1.Battery life.
The product was meant for me, i often forget to charge my phone and this doesn't seem to get discharged. THAT SOLVES YOUR LONG DRIVE PROBLEMS, NO POWER BANK NEEDED.
2. Camera quality
 I have been using other brands so expected the camera quality a little better from samsung, it is good,but when you zoom in  the pixels get distorted too early. The wide angle feature is a good addition but at the cost of quality. When you switch to 48 Mp it gets a little better. The night mode to my surprise worked better than what i had expected.The light adjustment in the night mode is excellent and if you are a Xiaomi phone user you will observe the better light adjustment during the normal mode as well as the night mode. The front camera is almost similar to any other phone in this segment but again has the feature of wide angle selfie, so no need to find the tallest guy to take the group selfie.
3. Performance
The overall performance has been very good, it is  running smooth though i haven't played heavy games like Pubg on it yet. But i feel it won't deteriorate it's performance in fact you might enjoy the graphics more , as the display quality is superb.
4. Fingerprint sensor.
The sensor quality needs to be improved, it sometimes doesn't read at all and often responds with a lag.
5. Display and video
You are going to love the display and particularly the high quality video playing. If you like to watch videos and movies, hands down in this segment the high quality video playing will  win you over.
6. Sound
The sound quality seems good when you play it on the speakers but gets even better with the microphone when you switch on the Dolby effect( it works only on microphone not speakers). But trust me you are going to enjoy  your playlist  with your microphones on.

Pros.
# Awesome and Vivid display - Thanks to the 6.4" Super Amoled display with good viewing angles
# Excellent battery backup with the mammoth 6000 mAh battery
# Fast charger within the box
# Phone is reasonably fast for daily usage considering the price
# Sound output is average but audio output through 3.5 mm jack is better with Dolby Atmos support if you use descent earphones
# I liked the Super Steady Video mode which I felt is more stable than One Plus 7T super stable mode

Cons.
# Camera - Daylight shots are good but struggles at night, Shots captured during night produces a lot of noise in the pics
# Selfie lacks details and gives a soft tone on pics
# 48 mp not upto the mark and lacks details but can be fixed via OTA update in future

Overall a good product and I'm happy with it.
Thanks to Amazon for fast delivery and service.

Wonderful Product in such a tiny range, everything is good, I bought it after using Samsung A50, except for little high weight and thickness in comparison, I find nothing deficient, nevertheless, A50 is comparatively expensive with fewer specifications plus problems like overheating, I once thought I should switch to some other less expensive chinese brand, however M30S specifications (6+ 128 Gb Variant I bought) and reviews plus Samsung reputation in manufacturing low SAR value phones  motivated me and I gave a try with no disappointments till yet of almost six months of usage, so go ahead with this Monster, if you wish to not compromise with brand and specifications in tiny budget.......

A premium phone with decent camera at very economical price
After long term usase I switched from OnePlus 6 to Samsung Galaxy M30s and it feels exciting and little bad as well as I am using it more and more. I have summarised all features and my experience with this phone here👇🏻;

*Update; Now I have been using it since over 1 month and it's hanging during typing in "Notes", "Browser", "Amazon" &amp; "WhatsApp".

Let's start with it's Pros;

✓✓ The screen is really bigger and chin is really smaller than any phone,
✓✓ It offers Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection for the screen protection for both screen and back
✓✓ It comes with an USB Type c and a fast-charging feature
✓✓ With huge storage, the phone comes with a dedicated microSD card slot,
✓✓ Slow motion is impressive but loses clearity and flickers in artificial lights,
✓✓ 4K video recording at 30fps and 1080 at 30/60/120fps with gyro-EIS,
✓✓ 48mp camera works well and produces clear pictures and selfy camera is great as well,

Let's start with Cons;

✓✓ Right after setting it up I realised phone is heating up, and same is experienced during charging too,
✓✓ Phone charged only up to 42% in an hour,
✓✓ Fingerprint sensor too small in comparison with other phones but after sometimes you get used to with that,
✓✓ Phone seems bigger in size and bulky too after using back cover. Its big battery may be one of major reason behind this

Final verdict;
For this range it may be best phone at present for everyone. For general mobile users there might be no issue using it

You can make your decision on this product by reading my review. Do hit HELPFUL if you find it helpful.

Dear Samsung,
I brought this phone on 3rd December. I Switched from IOS to Android. It was very exciting as well as challenging for me. I was looking for perfect replacement for my Iphone. The search of mine made me analyse many companies and phones and after a week’s time of hard core analysis found this phone as a perfect phone for me and after using for only few days I was mesmerized by its features and fast processor. The most fantastic feature is its AMOLED Display with outstanding Sensors and touch feature.

Display: Fantastic AMOLED Display with high sensitivity adds up to 50% feature and gives rich look to the phone
Battery: With 6000 mAH, the phone provides you enough power to use it continuously for 2-3 days without even worrying to charge. If you are a phone enthusiast, it is the perfect phone for you. It is surely a 2-3 day battery. The best part is its fast charging, helping the phone to charge within 2-2.5 hrs.

Camera: With its 48 mega pixel camera its helps me to capture moments very effectively and are mesmerizing to share on social media platforms. It is a perfect replacement for DSLR. With its Super slow motion effect the moments are captured as if they are very real and provides a movie like effect.

Processor: Any phone having a lots of apps and data needs to have high speed processing software. With its advance android 9 the phone helps me to open and access all the Apps with just one touch.

At last but not the least I want to thank amazon for help me grabbing a great offer with Samsung and delivering it to me within 24 hours.
Good job Amazon Keep It Up!!!!!

Okay i have been using samsung galaxy m30s for the past 1 month. I will share my practical experience.
1.  The main point which we all are attracted is battery life.isnt it. I would say that battery life is decent but i didn't find it extraordinarily amazing. I mean if you continously use your internet in it it will only last for around 10 hours max. And also though battery is big but charging time is also very long. So if you compare with other mobile with less battery you will find that ratio of usage/charge is less for samsung. You have to give 2.3 hours for charging and that is quite long
2. Now comes the camera. I personally dont like the camera in terms of picture quality.  Earlier i had note 5 pro. I found that camera giving me more clarity. Though its 48 mp but the image quality is very soft. Yeah but you can get a good dynamic range and nice color reproduction.
3. The best thing about samsung is ui. Its very simple yet very sorted.
4. The screen experience will be amazing as it has sper amloed display.
 5. I didnt like the processor very much. Exynos 9611 is not that fast if you would compare to snapdragon. I find lag sometimes while opening apps.
So overall i would say that if you are byuing it for battery i would not suggest to buy it because you must not only look at battery size but at charging time. The ratio is what matters. And literally you wont be getting excessive advantage of big battery. Next dont have too much expectations with camera. Colors will be good but not the clarity.
I would recommend to go for realme xt because thats a good overall package.

I've been using this phone for more than 3months now. I'll start with the pros first:
-hugh hugh battery life. And fhe difference really shows.
-screen quality very very good. Super amoled screen is really good to look at.
-the samsung UI is flawless as always.
-daylight performance of the camera is good.
-you can play pubg at 60fps in low graphics and there is also the option for 40fps at hdr graphics. So by this you can judge the performance of this phone.
-even though the battery is so hugh, it charges really fast.
-face unlock works very fine.
-the phone has not lagged even for once in day to day usage.

Cons:
-camera in night time is not that great.
-the phone feels heavy in hand after applying case, because of the 6000mah battery. Sometimes my smallest finger starts to pain because of holding the phone for long. If you're not a fan of heavy phones, go for a50 or a50s which is much much lighter. This is the biggest con that i feel about this device.
-sometimes the fingerprint doesn't read if hands are sweaty, which is probably the case with all phones.
-the gradient color looks really cool while the white color looks dull.
-even though there is option for 60fps in pubg, the game lags sometimes, but it does so even in poco and one plus that my friends are using so, i guess that's the game's fault really.
-sometimes minor lags are seen while answering and disconnecting calls. Nothing major.

To sum up, I'm quite happy with this device and would really recommend this to anyone who's keeping it as an option.

YouTube Live Streaming is not coming properly, it is buffering. I am having another Mobile i.e Samsung Galaxy ON7 PRO which is far better than this mobile. In that phone there is no Live Streaming issue, Galaxy On7 PRO is 2+16 GB but this M30 was 6+128 GB. With this improved memory it should work very well but, it is reversed. I have contacted SAMSUNG but they have not giving proper reply. I realized that never buy SAMSUNG Mobiles

I brought this device with high hopes and here is my review and opinion.

1) although it has 6000 mAh battery but still 1 full charge leasts 1 single day with always data , 30-40% brightness , no gaming , 2 hrs video on YT at 360p

2) gaming doesn't sucks just lower the resolution

3) camera is good need a few software tweak
(Sample shots are given )

4) The biggest issue i have found is the display it has a warm colour in it. The most annoying think I found is the display.

Overall a good phone just be aware it has a warm display

I bought the 6GB Ram+128GB Internal storage variant. The phone is overall good. There are some pros and cons which shall be given below
Pros:
1. The obvious pro about this phone is the amazing  mammoth battery life of 6000mah. This can easily last for 1 to 1.5 days on medium to extreme usage.
2. The amoled screen offered is one of the best qualities and the videos are very crisp, vibrant and the colour balance is very good.
3. The loudspeaker offered is one of the best in the segment and provides good clarity voice at an excellent volume.
4. When the earphones and bluetooth headphones are plugged in the phone offers Dolby Atmos surround and it is very good
5. There are a lot of features that can be played around with.
  The phone comes out with Android 9 pie and I have also got a
  recent security update.
6. The camera is decent and offers wide variety  of options for taking photos and shooting videos.

Cons:
1. The build quality, especially the back cover feels very
  plasticky and does not give a very premium feel.
2. The face unlock and the fingerprint sensors sometimes fail to
  recognise even though there is proper lighting for face
  unlocking or even though you would have properly placed
  your finger in the sensor.
3.  There seems to be a connectivity issue with the handset as it
  takes a long time to connect to Wifi networks or to start the
  data from the sim. The incoming calls also takes some time
  to get connected.
4. The camera is decent but the only con is that the 48mp is not
  selected by default and you have to select ot manually sometimes.

What i use my phone for: connectivity, occassional galing(pubg), watching videos, reading books, photography.
Previous to this I was using poco f1, and in just 9 months, some software issues arised, and(no physical damage), and though it was still in the warranty period they refused to repair it outright.
I was in need of a reliable phone, which had most specs and was affordable.
Samsung M30s came as a boon...This is 4 days of using the phone..
-Amazing battery life,
-display is great,
-you can play games like pubg easily, without lag,
-camera is also great(picture attached- no filter),
-exynos ensures fast processing.
-6gb/128gb provides good processing and good memory.
-Speaker initially seemed a bit off, but I changed the settings and now sound quality is loud and clear. Dolby atmos support is only for earphones.
-No heating while charging or playing games. -Takes a little more than 2 hours for full charge.
-affordable and samsung ka bharosa.
Cons:
- face recognition takes a split second more(not that big a deal)
-earphone jack is on the lower side(which I am not used to)

After a long time samsung has made truly a smartphone perfectly suited for indian users (and yes we all are power users to some extend) ..lemme sort things out..
1- Camera - Cant say the word "Outstanding" .. as it needs to be perfect...but hey no smartphone is true match for DSR Full frame sensors... So i took about 50 photos with M30s .. Picture comes shape color is accurate and specially it is made for our indian tonne so yea i m SATISFIED..
2 - Build - i was using levovo P2 before .. so i am used to metal body .. M30s has a plastic body .. and this is very subjective .. actually for this price building quality is not so bad as some say...anyway a backcover will solve this problem..haha..
3 - Performance - Mid range chipset has great performance.. I played some decent games like PubG, COD, Darkness etc..works fine with medium setting..
4 - Battery - on the first day i charged M30s to 80% .. after 4-5 hrs i was worried as battery was getting very low..after that i looked in forms and asked some experts about it..they told me Samsung M30s has a "Optimized" Option .. then i switched from normal to Optimized options and boy the results were outstanding .. as u use M30s .. it learns our usage patterns and optimises background apps , screen brightness , CPU clockspeed etc according to it.. and now finally after 9 days i m getting a ridiculous 9+ HRS of Screen On Time...with moderate use and 6+ Hrs with gaming...

I m fully satisfied with Samsung M30S .. Hope you make your choice soon..

Excellent phone am loving it...The most important is to take screen shot like motorola phone which was my previous phone...Volume down button and power button which is on the right side of the handset....Its very easy to take screenshots..Anither thing is DOLBY ATMOS AND 6000MAH battery...in which other phones you can find these features i bet....battery life is awesome..Its more than 10 hrs..Very helpful while travelling for long.

Got this phone for my daughter. Was skeptical about the quality. However, I am very presently surprised. The screen is superb, phone runs very fast, descent camera. The huge battery is a big plus for us.

The plastic back feels little cheap, but hey, at this price point and with the other plus points, I don't think I could have asked for more.

I Got Android Pie with One UI 1.5 along with adaptive fast charging adaptor out of the box. Let me share with you my experience;

PROS;
✓✓ Display is Super AMOLED, outdoor display brightness is better than M30,
✓✓ Ultra-wide camera is improved and captures 123 degree
✓✓ Battery is bigger enough to be compared with a battery of MacBook Pro,
✓✓ Phone is lightweight as 188gm while holding a bigger battery with capacity of 6000mAh,
✓✓ Triple camera setup includes a 48mp Samsung GM1 sensor, an 8mp ultra wide angle lens and a 5mp depth. Front camera is also 16mp,
✓✓ It does not have EIS but Super Steady mode is impressive. It can record 4K videos, Super Slow-Mo and Hyper lapse,
✓✓ Type-C port along with a 3.5mm headphone jack provided,
✓✓ Exynos 9611 octa-core chipset based on a 10nm process. Same processor has been used on Samsung A50S which is being sold at higher price by same brand. Performance is smooth and competent for playing games because Exynos 9611 is better than the Snapdragon 665 as per my experience,

CONS;
✓✓ Body is made of plastic which makes it quality inferior and does not give it a premium look like other Samsung phones,
✓✓ Front screen and Back glass are not protected like Corning Gorrila Glass so beware of losing it. (If you have enrolled for Amazon 1 year screen replacement program then fine otherwise AMOLED display replacement can cost you minimum Rs.6k)
✓✓ Processor is power consuming and Battery performance is not upto expectation, even its same almost like M30 as I compared with my brothers phone,
✓✓ 15W fast charging is slow for this giant battery,
✓✓ Small size apertures (48mp cam with an f/2.0 aperture, 5mp with an f/2.2 and 8mp with f/2.2.) capture less light through it. Result average night mode and less blurred bokeh,
✓✓ Front cam selfie lack detailing and seems smoother and Super steady mode does not work on it,
✓✓ No inscreen fingerprint sensor like Mi A3 which is earlier launched in lower range,
✓✓ NFC is no future technology and missing it in a latest phone does make it lack at some point
✓✓ Face unlock is not faster and effective
✓✓ Slo-mo video Flickers in artificial lightening

Final verdict;
As per my experience if you want to stuck with Samsung then you can go for Samsung M30 which will give you better battery backup with lighter weight and less mAh and better image quality in lesser megapixels and bigger Aperture.
And if you can go with another brand then Xiaomi A3 is an option which is more economical with better camera, inscreen fingerprint sensor and display protected by Corning Gorilla glass.

Design
Decent looks and build quality - with a a unibody polycarbonate design, and glossy finish on the back panel - quite similar to the M30 - the only major visual difference is that the triple camera setup gets a wider, rectangular module to house the LED flash and "48 megapixel" branding
The plastic body keeps the phone feeling relatively lightweight at 188 grams, which is mighty impressive for a phone packing a big 6000mAh battery
It also feels great to hold with a seamless curved panel that meets the display up front
Modern, Infinity-U front - bezels around the screen are slim, except for a slightly thick chin - you still get around 90 per cent screen-to-body ratio, which is great
Fingerprint sensor at the back is easy to reach
The power button and volumes are quite flush with the frame which means they lack that tactile, clicky feel
Lacks the premium finish of some of its competitors
Display
Gorgeous, 6.4-inch FHD+ (2340x1080) Super AMOLED Infinity-U display with excellent viewing angles, and brightness levels - easily one of the best displays in the price bracket
It also comes with "Widevine L1" certification, which helps stream content in crisp HD resolution
Blacks are deep on the AMOLED display, which looks good with Night mode enabled
Software
Samsung's OneUI is today one of the more clean, refined Android UIs that's especially well optimized for large displays like this
One UI also brings in other useful stuff, like a System-wide Night mode (which turns the background completely black, and looks great on the M30s' AMOLED display), and Always On Display option
Performance
Good, strong performance with the Exynos 9611 at the core (similar to Snapdragon 665) - everyday performance to high-end gaming - everything is handled smoothly
Camera
Decent rear camera setup - 48MP main sensor + 8MP wide-angle lens + 5MP depth sensor
With the primary lens, you get bright and attractive photos in daylight conditions with vibrant colours and good contrast - dynamic range is also wide and noise is controlled
Switching to the wide-angle lens will offer a new perspective, letting you click a wider area at close range to the subject (it is best used in daylight, however, as wide-angle captures look grainy and noise indoors or in low light)
The dedicated Night mode can be used with the main camera - it comes in handy in low-light conditions, extending the shutter time to allow more light into the frame - making for some decent low-light photos
Live Focus does a decent job at separating the subject from the background, and giving good bokeh shots
The 16MP selfie camera too does a decent job when it comes to capturing selfies outdoors under bright light (though it starts to struggle indoors and in low light, offering softer selfies with a lot of grain)
Overall, the cameras on the M30s are decent for the price bracket, even though they are not the best (that title is shared by Xiaomi and Realme phones)
Focusing is slow at times
Overall low light camera performance still feels lacking
Battery
Monster 6000mAh battery delivers an incredible 2-3 days of usage easily, making for one of the largest battery life smartphones currently available
Supports 15W fast charging
Verdict
With the M-series performing well for Samsung, M30s is well-set to add to that success, delivering a good all-round package with one key differentiator - an incredible battery life - if that is one of your primary concerns in a phone, then the M30s is a no-brainer (if on the other hand you want the best camera or best performance for your buck, you can look at Xiaomi or Realme phones in this price bracket)

Overall, I am satisfied. It does meet the expectation with a superb battery life. 6000 mAh is just like what one who is super busy needs. It gets enough charged in just 1 hr to sustain the entire duration of office hours.
The fingerprint reader is cool but it lacks a little bit. Ig does not delays much. The delay is in nano seconds so if you don't focus, you won't even notice it.
Tbe camera is good! Especially the wide angle. But the only fault is that it doesn't give expected results in low lighting conditions. I have attached some images captured by the same for comparotive reasons where you can clearly see the difference of quality when clicked in varied light conditions.

Samsung has made a come back with their new set of galazy series phone and this beats the the complete set of mobile phones within that segment .
Amazed features:
1. Image and video stabilization beats my expectations.
2. Image quality and features are amazing.
3. Video quality is too good.
4. Features associated within the phone beats the premium phone segment (all those XR series :P)
5. Screen sensitivity is over and above expectation.
6. Color segmentation and saturation is too good.
7. Battery life is amazing.
Cons:
1. Finger print sensor could have been even more responsive.
2. Charger wire length is too short.
3. There is no screen guard and phone cover within the phone.

I have been using the device from over a month and writing my reveiws about the product.
PROS and CONS-
- Battery is awesome- the battery is the most important feature and it is a beast easily last two days on above average usage.
-Camera- camera is quite good on performnce but can be improved furthur
-Screen- the big thing about Samsung is the quality of display they never fail at this the screen is very good and gives good viewing angles and high picture clearity.
Fingerprint- the fingerprint is fast and is placed at the right place.

Now you might be thinking that i am just bragging about the product but wait my friend the review is not over yet.

-surely everything has has its downside but the price and quality also matters
-Samsung as a brand has taken the market by storm by introducing alow budget stunner but still there asmre many improvements like - on the processor side the more advance and optimized snapdragon soc can be used as offered by Mi or Realme
-camera improvements can be also done to a certain extent

Overall I would say that the deal is awesome as you'll never get disappointed with the phone.

Thanks for reading....

Everything thing is fine, the phone works smoothly. I am not into gaming, so I can't tell you about that.
1. Except gaming, phone's performance is decent,
  battery stands upto 36-40 hours in day to day
  usegs. It takes less then 2 hours to charge
  6000mah with 15 Watt provided charger.
2. Photography is Good, all modes works decent
  except the 48MP mode,it took so much time to
  process the image and it even becomes worse
  when you have to take continuous shots in 48
  MP mode.
  Portrait shots are Good, edge detection is fine.
  On the video end it works decent.
3. Phone has some serious issues with network, I
  had tried it with airtel, idea, and Jio at number
  of places, it is not loosing the network but is
  almost on the edge of loosing at many places
  that affects the Data speed.
4. Fingerprint is very Good. But the face unlock is
  worse. It unlocks the phone even when you are
  sleeping, good thing is that when you set up pre
  face unlock phone Will give you this eye closings
  warning. But the worst part is that you don't
  have a app Lock in the UI, you have to download
  it from Samsung app store which I don't prefer
  cuz of third party trust issue. App Lock is a well
  known issue with Samsung which I don't know
  earlier.

Good phone with overall performance. Delivered on time by Amazon.
Looks stylish and amazing display. Little slippery on hand but a protective cover can address that.
Battery is powerful
Camera quality is good but does not seem to be 48 MP and I am yet to explore all features.
Sound quality is good but speaker is average.
Fast charging is not fast as expected.
I am not game enthusiast so not explored performance on this front.
Overall happy with my choice...

In this 3 futures are awasome..!
1.Finger print sensor perfect like lighting speed..more sensitive 🤩
2.Back Camera quality is * normal mode is excellent. *pro mode awesome like we can customise the white balance 2300k to 9900k , iso &amp; light balanace but small drawback is we do not set shutter speed.*panaroma mode perfect image quality. * live focus is also perfect . *night mode also good but i am not satisfied. *super slow motion and slow motion are really enjoyable. *hyperlapse mode is excellent in that we can customized our speed auto ,4x ,8x, 16x &amp;32x. *And Wide lens is so helpful for taking group photos and nature frames. The 48 megapixel is more quality images we can capture  *for photographers its more helpfull to capture the beautiful moments.
3.Front camera is good in that also wide  focus is there its helpful for group selfie AR emoji is havingmore fun with frends.
4.Battery life  i brought this mobile only for battery capacity 6000mah...2days once only i put charge..24*7 in my mobile 4g mobile data is enable...its perfect mobile phone of this year 2k19 .
I have uploaded my pics which i capture in this samsung m30s but which i  have uploaded insta post only..

: Please don't buy this phone.. Battery backup is very bad.. 6000mah battery is only a number.. Xiaomi or realme vivo oppo 4000mah or 5000mah is much better than this 6000mah. I was really not expecting this type of backup from samsung. Single star rating for this Samsung Galaxy M30S

I got this phone on 29th Oct, 2019. Got it effectively for 11,900.
After using for 12 days, this is my review:
Pros:
1) The battery life is just awesome. The battery lasted more than a day with normal usage (no gaming) and with 1-1.5 hrs of pubg at high settings, it still gave about a day's usage with about 40% left at night. The charging time is not less, keep it in mind. It takes about 2 hours to fully charge even in fast charging mode.
2) Display- Just superbb... sAMOLED display at 1080p is just pleasing. No problems of visibility in outdoors.
3) Headphone, earphone (wired/BT) audio output is fab with Dolby Atmos enabled.
4) Rest everything is just fine. Nothing more to particularly praise.
Cons:
1) The first thing I noticed was that the fingerprint reader is a bit slow. Takes about a second to unlock and sometimes doesn't recognize my fingerprint. Face unlock is good though.
2) The most important con is the camera. Although Samsung claims it has a 48mp cam and shots will be ultra-clear, it isn't that great, to be honest. Images appear sharp in well lit/external environments. But when you zoom in the pic, it appears to get pixelated (image tends to get softened). Same is the problem with wide angle shots. Low light photography is not at all good. Video playback is good but stability isn't. There is a super steady mode but that pixelates the video objectionably.
3) There is a slight memory management issue. Even when I don't use anything, it shows just 900-1gb memory free which I think should be around 1.5gb.

That's my review if the phone. Overall, it's a great phone in this price segment.

Verdict- 4/5

Doesn't lag, gives an optimum performance on most games. Few hiccups are always expected. But on this budget, the device really stands out on almost everything it has to offer. The camera is a bit sluggish, but does the job. I don't really use the fingerprint scanner, but still works good. Handy, beast battery life , good resolution and color palette, all add up to a great budget and quality device.

I bought this phone during the Amazon festival sale. I was pleasantly surprised by how light the phone was despite the claims of housing a 6000 mA battery. I was previously using the moto g3 mobile.The display on this phone is excellent and I'm very much satisfied with the vibrant colours and the deep blacks. The Super AmoLED screen is pretty good and touch is responsive. On the design front, I would say that the phone is evenly balanced, light and easy to handle. The Samsung One UI was something I found most disappointing and I replaced it with Lawnchair launcher immediately. The One UI interface has very limited options and I'm used to having a very small display size. Since samsung had not provided and option to adjust the display size, I had to use adb to change the DPI. The camera is another area which I found lacking. Shots with the wide angle lens seem to be more curved. And the details on the photos taken were found to be lacking in detail when compared to other 48 megapixel camera phones.Get a good protective back cover to avoid having the camera panel scratched. They dont provide earphones in the box. The charging cable could have been a little longer. The one supplied is insanely short and not even a meter long. Operating systems is clean with one UI core so it's near stock experience.My suggest: Buy it confidently...😊✌

Camera , display are ok. Battery moderate in spite of 6000 mAh.
BUT NETWORK RECEPTION QUALITY IS VERY POOR IN AREAS HAVING WEEK SIGNAL STRENGTH COMPARE to  MI MAX 2 , Redmi Note 6 pro &amp; realms 5 as I have all these mobiles.  Samsung must take note of it &amp; rectify this serious issue with appropriate software update.

Display - Its really good with excellent options at the low budget,screen is good ,also have blue light filter option.Excellent

Battery - I personally felt it could be much more better ,works like a 5000Mah Battery. Needs a bit of stability.

Processor speed- Its really good ,after installing multiple apps and games also it didn't get hanged. Working fine.

Mobile Heating- As of now I didn't find any heating up of mobile back ,but we can feel a little heat while charging and continuous watching of high quality YouTube videos.

Charging - It supports fast charging and charges fast. Usually take 1 hour 20 mins from 10 to 100%.

Photos &amp; Videos : It has various modes in taking photos and videos including slow motion and themed photos.  Images are very good from back camera .While front camera needs a bit of improvement.  Videos are good and have stability.

Overall it is worth for the price as sold by Amazon. I got this for 12000 after all the offers.Fast delivery by Amazon as they delivered in less than 24 hours (depends on your location)

I recommend others to buy. Thanks Amazon !

I ordered the 6-128, blue variant of this smartphone as soon as it was launched. Tbh amazon was a tad unprofessional with delievering it to me on due date..but at last they did it and they did it without any problem.
It's going to be about 2 months now since I've been using it and I would say it's a complete package for everyone who is looking for a smartphone with features which existed only in high end phones before.
-&gt;M30s clearly keeps his promise as its 6000mAh battery really lives up to its potential. Once fully charged its easily goes for 36 hours for normal usage..even more. For rigurous gamers also, it lasts upto 15-16 hrs. easily.
-&gt;Samsung threw the best at us with Exynos 9611 with an octa core processor which lives up to its hype. Working is super fast, and with pie, its features are nice. I know some of its features like fingerprint scanner work a tad slow than other smartphones you can buy in lower budgets than this..but then its Samsung you are talking about..and its influence on Indian market. It hanged for a time when I used it in direct sunlight..but with patch update after that that problem is resolved now.
-&gt;With its 48 megapixel camera the pics after quite good with no afyer effects problem. However, the only flaw I found in this smartphone was the lack of depth its 5MP camera provided..coz when you zoom it a lot you can see the problem it has.
It's AR mode even didn't worked before..but now with an AR update it works and works very well.
-&gt;I'm happy that this smartphone comes without the hybrid slot coz I've never been a fan of that. Type C charging provides a fast charging as said and yes it does charges fully in about 2-3 hours. Also earphone jack is back in this after M40 which is a nice comeback. We all love that don't we.

To summarise, I would say its a must buy or at least to consider one if you a re looking for one in 15k to 20k budget. With a satifaction guarantee which Samsung provides. Apart for that depth flaw..I recommend it to everyone who is doubtful of buying it or not.

Go ahead and buy it...it will not fail you.

i am writing this review after 2 months of usage . This phone started hanging after 1 months of usage . And now the condition is this that it has gone totally blank . It's screen is not turning on and i tried to switch off but nothing is working. Its the worst phone I've ever bought . I recommend to all guys don't buy any samsung phones only because their screen is good . what is the use of good screen if you can't turn it on or even make a call . It's better to buy NOKIA 1100. I was using VIVO X21 for 1 year before buying this and honestly speaking not a single day hanging problem and worked fine . Really buying SAMSUNG phones is just like buying a shit....

At last I recommend all guys to not buy any SAMSUNG PHONE in future. But if still you are interested in buying SAMSUNG phones then go for the PREMIUM SERIES LIKE S series of samsung.

Most economical Samsung phone less with latest features
I expected much from this mobile but still for Samsung in this price this phone is surprise. I Got Android Pie with One UI 1.5 along with adaptive fast charging adaptor out of the box. Let me share with you my experience;

PROS;
✓✓ Display is Super AMOLED, outdoor display brightness is better than M30,
✓✓ Ultra-wide camera is improved and captures 123 degree
✓✓ Battery is bigger enough to be compared with a battery of MacBook Pro,
✓✓ Phone is lightweight as 188gm while holding a bigger battery with capacity of 6000mAh,
✓✓ Triple camera setup includes a 48mp Samsung GM1 sensor, an 8mp ultra wide angle lens and a 5mp depth. Front camera is also 16mp,
✓✓ It does not have EIS but Super Steady mode is impressive. It can record 4K videos, Super Slow-Mo and Hyper lapse,
✓✓ Type-C port along with a 3.5mm headphone jack provided,
✓✓ Exynos 9611 octa-core chipset based on a 10nm process. Same processor has been used on Samsung A50S which is being sold at higher price by same brand. Performance is smooth and competent for playing games because Exynos 9611 is better than the Snapdragon 665 as per my experience,

CONS;
✓✓ Body is made of plastic which makes it quality inferior and does not give it a premium look like other Samsung phones,
✓✓ Front screen and Back glass are not protected like Corning Gorrila Glass so beware of losing it. (If you have enrolled for Amazon 1 year screen replacement program then fine otherwise AMOLED display replacement can cost you minimum Rs.6k)
✓✓ Processor is power consuming and Battery performance is not upto expectation, even its same almost like M30 as I compared with my brothers phone,
✓✓ 15W fast charging is slow for this giant battery,
✓✓ Small size apertures (48mp cam with an f/2.0 aperture, 5mp with an f/2.2 and 8mp with f/2.2.) capture less light through it. Result average night mode and less blurred bokeh,
✓✓ Front cam selfie lack detailing and seems smoother and Super steady mode does not work on it,
✓✓ No inscreen fingerprint sensor like Mi A3 which is earlier launched in lower range,
✓✓ NFC is no future technology and missing it in a latest phone does make it lack at some point
✓✓ Face unlock is not faster and effective
✓✓ Slo-mo video Flickers in artificial lightening

Final verdict;
As per my experience if you want to stuck with Samsung then you can go for Samsung M30 which will give you better battery backup with lighter weight and less mAh and better image quality in lesser megapixels and bigger Aperture.
And if you can go with another brand then Xiaomi A3 is an option which is more economical with better camera, inscreen fingerprint sensor and display protected by Corning Gorilla glass.

First of all, I would like to thank &amp; appreciate  Samsung for coming up with such a great budget friendly smartphone - Samsung M30s

It's been 2 months, since I've bought this phone &amp; I'm loving it. Samsung was late to enter the midranged mobile category which has been dominated by the chinese firms, but finally they have heard their customers' demand and brought in a very competetive mobile in its class. I bought the 6GB 128GB variant.

Below are the Pro's &amp; Con's of the Samsung M30s according to me:

Pros:
1. One UI seems lighter and simpler, working fine without any lag
2. Super Amoled screen, colors are punchy, viewing angles are great.
3. Back camera 48MP, takes really good pictures, turn on scene optimizer for even better pictures.
4. Battery is huge and Samsung has made it even better, I'm getting Screen On Time(SOT) of 9-10 hrs
5. Sound quality (Dolby atmos) via headphones.
6. Games like PUBG, COD, etc runs fine better than redmi note 7 pro.

Cons:
1.Build quality, it's not upto the mark.
2. Front 16MP camera is very average and the results is soft picture.
3. Signal reception is also average, you will get 1 bar less signal compared to other phones in competition.
4. Back wide angle camera 8MP, taking images when fish eye effect can be fixed.

Finally, I would like to say that if you want a mid-ranged light weight smartphone with good battery life and camera. Go ahead with Samsung M30s

Writing this review after using this device for more than a week.  I would jot down my points in pros and cons.
Pros :-
1. A decent battery life. It's better than others cause it's a 6000 mah battery.  4/5
2. Display is superb thanks to the super amoled screen it offers. 5/5
3. Multi tasking is okay not that I would say completely satisfied.  But it does the job. 4/5
4. Yup you can play games hassle free. 4/5

Cons :-
1. THE BIGGEST CON OR I MUST SAY DECEIVING FACT ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THE 48MP CAMERA ITS SAYS IT IS OFFERINGS.  THIS IS THE LIE OF THE YEAR. THE CAMERA IS NOWHERE NEAR 48MP BUT IT IS A 8 MP CAMERA. IF YOU ARE A PHOTO ENTHUSIAST DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOBILE.
1/5

2. SOUND IS ALSO NOT GOOD. THEY HAVE COMPROMISED IN THIS FEATURE AS WELL. 2/5

3. NO NOTIFICATION FEATURE.  IF THE PHONE IS LOCKED YOU WOULD NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY NOTIFICATION OR ANY MISSED CALLS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

THANKS FOR READING.  HOPE THIS HELPS.

1. The phone gets overheated during charging and during continuous use for(call/surfing/gaming)  more than 30 mins.
2. The mic/mouthpiece is so poor, to receive the voice by normally holding the phone by ear. Every time the person on other side of the call asks to repeat the voice (as unable to listen properly) or to talk loudly.
3. It asks for unlocking using primary password/pattern(No finger or face recognition accepted) to start the phone after every restart/switch-on. And every time we restart the phone we need to apply the password/pattern to start the phone functioning.(It doesnot automatically starts as other brands)

I generally don’t write reviews. But this phone has taken all my patience out. 2 months and it’s not working. Samsung service centre says the board has got complaint. Battery too not working. They said a new phone can’t be provided. Only thing is they can send to some random service centre. Pathetic phone pathetic service. Samsung yet again proves apart from their Galaxy S9 S10 series all other phones are just crap!

NETWORK PROBLEM, I have reduced stars for fingerprint/camera etc just to bring while rating down.

When you don't get a NETWORK in first place what's the use of all the other features.

Have tried resetting or applying LTE setting multiple times no luck ... VERY BAD NETWORK OR NO NETWORK RECEPTION.

please buy some other mobile,  as it beats down main usage..

P.s I have a Note 5/co pro same sim cards works fine in those phones .. while m30s has ZERO NETWORK OR VERY HIGLY UNSTABLE NETWORK RECEPTION

Have asked return from amazon.

Update on 05/11
=============

Amazon has told this product has no refund whilst its on their Q&amp;A Section.

They have promised me the replacement will be quality checked and if any problem arise further then that would be dealt in a return policy ( Hopeful ! ) . will update once I receive the next replacement product.

So, I'm using Samsung galaxy M30s 4+64 variant for 3 months now and here's my overall review..
This phone have amazing battery backup for sure. Literally I watched whole movie in just 10% charging. Fast charging is also quite fast. If you charge your phone for half hour once in a day it indeed lasts atleast for a day.
Apart from battery backup, screen pamel of the smartphone is just amazing.. I haven't put any tempered glass on my screen. Still there's no scratch and it still feels like new.. all over screen of this phone is great at this price.
Camera, well the phone have okay-ish camera.. I'm not that much satisfied with it.. although 48 megapixels camera is good in day light. Durability of phone is not bad but also not that good. Better you buy a case for it.
Performance is another plus point of phone. In 4+64 variant, you can game without any worry of heat or lag. Best part is you can play most of the games on their high settings with slight heat but that's bearable. (PUBG on smooth+extreme frame rate) on such settings, battery lasts atleast for 7-8 hours. Even though I play in medium graphics. About fingerprint sensor there is nothing to worry. One UI is great in its way.
Buying this product won't disappoint you. Thank you. Hope it helps you..!! :)

Excellent display ,refreshing ONE UI , camera performance is brilliant in daylight , night time performance lacking, but can be improved with manual mode  . No telephoto lens , and difference is seen as compared to say s9+,but overall an absolute steal at this price point  . Battery lasts 1.25 days even  with very heavy usage  .

Touch and feel of the device is elegant. The slight hueon the back gives great look to the phone.
Camera quality is great with lot of modes to test out.
Fingerprint is quick and flawless.
Overall enjoying the fast and Monster experience.
Cheers to Amazon for fast delivery.
Thank you Samsung for an awesome phone.

Great purchase..
 purchased this mob. For Rs.7500 /- in amazon sale.(exchange+10% SBI discount+ 1000 amazon pay cash back).+ Free Screen replacement.
Amazon delivery n mob. exchange process is satisfying. Exchanged mob. Very easily.. as had some minor scratch on my exchanged device's body. (Better than Flipkart exchange policy.)
Now About Mob.
*Using from last 3 days. Moderate use.. not  heavy use.. charged once and after 3 days still battery remain 20%. So for moderate daily use it will surely gives you 2 days battery backup for sure.. as it claimed.
*Camera.- camera is good.. both front and back.. (not great)
*Display is awesome.. sAmoled display gives vary satisfying viewing experience.
* Performance is also good..
*Not a hybrid sim slot. Have 2 sim slot + dedicated memory card slot.

Talking abt problem.
 build quality is not so good. Compare to other mob. Available in market.
*Must have provided back cover/screen protector with mob. As other companies providing with their product.
*Not sure about wich glass is used for display protection. Must use tempered glass.

Overall mob. Is simply great if you are purchasing it in basic model for 13999/- price segment.. (for 15999 /- you must check in market you will find more good option)

It let's heaten up easily while playing games and when plugged into the charger also. But when playing games the game launcher try's to cool by leveling the brightness and sound effects and it is good also. When coming to camera the quality is not good as expected. It takes more than 3.5 hours to get it up to fully charge even using the fast charge adapter

Awesome Phone. This is the reasons why Samsung charge premium for their phones. As soon as you turn on this phone you are welcomed to a premium world called Samsung.  The One UI is the best skin on android. I would rate the UI experience on par with Oxygen OS if not better. The Samsung Super amoled display on M30S is the best display you can find on any phone upto a range of 35K.  I will not compare how would exonys with SD 712 or 730 but I can say that the performance is very fluid. I am using it from last 10 days and I have not noticed a single lag.I am playing Call of duty on this beast and it played very well without lag in medium graphics..Camera experience was also good as it takes decent pictures from both front and back in good lighting condition and struggle during Night. If you are choosing just for camera you may need to consider other options as camera is not its strength however it's not bad either. I would rate the camera to be above average overall and excellent during daytime..
Battery although it's 6000 MAH it performed like 4500 MAH. Don't get me wrong the battery performance was not bad it easily lasted for 1 and 1/2 days with medium usage with screen on time to be 9 to 10 hrs.but inward expecting 2 days of battery life.
Build is below average with a very cheap quality plastic used and there is a ceeaking nice when you press from side but I would ignore this as we normally don't press phone during day to day life
To conclude I would say this is best smartphone under 12K (11.6 K during offer) and Redmi Realme be aware Samsung is back.

This is a fantastic phone.  i have been using it for almost two weeks now and this Phone is really Beautiful. Value for Money. For the normal working person, You are unlikely to get a better option than this. The Battery is unreal. Finger Print reader works perfect. And Camera is of a quality of a high end premium Phone. In fact this IS Truly a very high end Premium Phone at budget middle class prices.
Please don't believe all the negative reviews. I've bought two of these Phones, both 6GB+128GB. By God's Grace SaiRama They're both working Beautifully &amp; Perfectly. Even with the heaviest use, i charge the battery only after 30 hours, and that's with really heavy use.
You know what they say, that there's no perfect phone?

They're Wrong.

This is Your Perfect Phone.

the device leaves a lasting impression as a capable all-round offering that doesn’t compromise on essentials. While the design could’ve been refined further, the handset has a gorgeous display, impressive cameras, reliable hardware, and a battery that’s miles ahead of its rivals.
Hardware and software
CPU:  Quad core, 2.3 GHz + Quad cor…GPU: Mali-G72 MP3RAM: 4 GBMemory: 64 GB + Up to 512 GBSIM Slots: Dual SIM , GSM+GSMBattery: 6000 mAH
Instead of talking about Samsung Galaxy M30s’ design, we’ll start this review with its innards. That’s because it has got some serious upgrades. The calling card of course, is its 6,000mAh battery – which hasn’t been seen on a mainstream smartphone yet, especially at this price point (there’s ROG Phone II as well, though one could argue that it’s focused on the gaming niche). And if the 5,000mAh pack on its predecessor managed to impress us, imagine how good the battery life on the M30s would be. Well, I tested out the phone as a daily driver and didn’t need to charge it before the end of two days. And this is when I used it extensively for battery-guzzling tasks like navigation and as a hotspot, along with streaming videos and podcasts, web surfing and checking email. In PCMark10’s battery test, the device scored 20 hours, which is impressive indeed.
And if you’re worried about putting the device on charge overnight as it’d take a long time to juice up, then don’t. Thanks to 15W charging support, it goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours. From my point of view though, maybe the brand should’ve opted for higher wattage, making charging it even faster.
While the M30 made use of Samsung’s new Exynos 7809 SoC, the Galaxy M30s gets an upgrade in the form of the octa-core Exynos 9611 chipset. The 10nm silicon offers two quad-core clusters of Cortex-A73 and Cortex-A53 running at 2.3GHz and 1.7GHz, respectively. To see how improved it is over the chip powering the device’s previous iteration, While the Galaxy M30s is better than the M30, it isn’t the fastest phone in town. Having said that, it does manage to hold its own. More importantly, I didn’t face any trace of lag while using it on a day-to-day basis. Multitasking is smooth as well, all thanks to 6 gigs of RAM.
The Exynos 9611 SoC comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well. Playing Asphalt 9 or PUBG Mobile  was a joyous affair, though there were certain instances of frame drops. And it’s worth noting that the device is able to play PUBG at the highest graphics settings, and if you choose the lower one, then the experience is much smoother. In terms of thermal efficiency, the device is quite good and heats up only a bit when it’s pushed to the limits.
Taking care of storage needs on the M30s is 128GB of built-in memory, which offers around 110GB to you out of the box. If need be, it can be topped up with the use of a microSD card. Since the phone has triple slots, you don’t need to sacrifice on the dual-SIM capabilities either.
The phone ships with Android 9.0 Pie which is layered with OneUI. We already love this minimalistic interface and its features such as dark mode, though have to point out that there’s still some bloatware preinstalled and you do get unnecessary notifications from the MyGalaxy  app.
Despite sporting a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M30s is quite loud. It’s not really rich however, and the fact that the sound gets muffled when you are holding the device in the landscape position is also a bummer.
Cameras
Primary camera: 48 MPFlash: LED FlashSecondary camera: 16 MP
Similar to its previous avatar, Samsung’s new Galaxy M30s flaunts a trio of sensors on its back. However, the primary camera gets an upgrade as it comes with a 48-megapixel sensor instead of a 16MP shooter.
 Pros
Astounding battery life
Packs a massive cell without being bulky or unwieldy
Great shooting capabilities
Smooth performance
Immersive Super AMOLED display
Cons
Night mode isn’t the best
Selfie shooter could’ve been better
No display protection.

Battery life is my only problem. It's not as long-lasting as made out to be. Otherwise it's an excellent device. The screen size could have been a couple millimetres larger, just to give its rival - Redmi Note 8 Pro - a run for its money. These are minor quibbles, I'm quite satisfied. Excellent display. One star less for the battery which fell short of my expectations.

The phone is a extension of the previous models. The battery looks good but yet to be tested fully. The camera is good. Clarity is fine. A few functions seen in the previous model like automatic blue tooth on were not found.  The call volume is not that much satisfactory but the volume of videos are good when compared to previous models. Overall it is good phone much suited for a middle class person who spends lot of time on calls. Definetly few improvements can be made in coming years

Mostly expected battery life.but it give disappointment after used for 3 months
Battery life time -7 to 9 hrs.even background apps are stopped battery getting down.actual battery capacity is 5800 mah not 6000 mah
Camera quality- quality of the pic looks nature but not worthy when compared with realme phone photos in this segment prices
Fingerprint sensor- good
Software update-updation are getting properly.
Weight-light weight easy to handle
Display-best one in the phone is display quality.no one can betean Samsung display in this budget segment.
Overall performance is good because I am not heavy game player.no lagging and hanging in my phone

Cons:
1) Charging point is totally different than usual Charging points of Samsung hence one need to keep carrying charger along with him or purchase 2 to 3 chargers.
2) Camera quality is very poor. It's like normal phone Camera.
3) unable to connect to USB by OTG due to different shape of Charging port.
4) Battery life is not good. It's as if of normal phone.
5) Samsung should not fool the ppl. They should not try to bring down their brand image by such claims without onground features.

Thank You,,

On the brighter side is the competitive pricing, amoled display, sound, and the overhyped battery. However, what is irking me the most is the 4G signal reception of the phone. Yesterday, on my way to Delhi by train, my co-passenger with MI phone and Jio sim was busy all through on U tube, while my phone was struggling for signals although I too have Jio sim for the Internet. I am really surprised. The other areas where I find the phone not so good are the camera, smaller screen width, to name a few.

Battery life is disappointing
The battery drains too quick and takes compatively longer to charge
Even on stand by the battery  discharges  at the rate of 3 to 4 percent  per hour.

This is an awesome phone considering the price range.
The best feature about it is the battery - 6000 mAh. #monster
The front camera is very good, but the back camera is above average, lacks some details when you zoom into the picture. The screen is sAmoled,its very smooth and cool. Premium looks.
Overall, its an amazing-amazing phone.

The phone feels little heavy with cover and infact the slimness and grace hides when the cover is put on. The cover is also necessary to guard the movile headset. Therefore, the dilemma rises.
The camera quality in this price range with such a battery backup is commendable. When used regularly, The battery runs for 24-28 hours with full charge. Even the battery can give you 7 days with fully charged condition mobile only for calls but internet, gaming, videos.

Bought this two months ago.
Highly recommended for those who want more battery backup.
This phone save your day by clearing your 'low battery anxiety' outta mind.

I'm using this everyday and i never turn off either mobile data or wifi and it'll still has 50% + at the end of the day.
Pros.
1. Battery 10/10 - lasts full day even if data/wifi enabled. Can last two days if you just using this for call or texting purposes.
2. Camera 6/10 - Average both rear and front. Wide angle is not great, not terrible.
3. Software 8/10 - Good interface. Normal android UI. Dark mode is perfect.
4. Performance 9/10 - Can play PUBG UHD mode without lag. (Need good data connection tho)
5. Sound 9/10 - Loud speaker and dolby mode are fantastic( Remember Dolby is effect only for earphones)
6. Heating problem - Normally No. But while playing high end games can feel mild warm on back side.
7. Network signal reception 7/10 - Average. Also it's accepts only Indian sim cards.
8. Charging speed 7/10 - Needs Approx. 2hr30mins to full charge even with fast charger.
9. Weight 6/10 - Heavy. Not heavy like moto.
10. Overall 8/10.

The camera quality is absolutely brilliant considering the flexibility of modes to shoot in whether it's different types of videos, slow motion, time lapse, etc. And the in-app filters also are great. The battery life is really fantastic because you can even use heavy apps the entire time and still it lasts for a long duration without charging also. The fingerprint reader identifies the print within no time and it's very easily accessible but it's also theft proof or almost impossible for a foreign entity to try and access it without our authorization. The touch response is smooth and speakers are also perfect for the person to hear audibly and well. The privacy on the phone is also brilliant as we can customize it to out liking, including the wallpapers, themes, tones, etc. And there is also a vast range of options to choose from in each feature. This model is not too less or not too much of anything unnecessary. It is just right. It gives better clarity to picture quality and a much better experience of owning a phone since it is so low maintenance yet so efficient. Once you go M30s, you wouldn't need anything else.  100% would recommend.

Great 6000mAh battery, 48MP camera triple camera, AMOLED display, fastcharging, dedicated SD slot, super steady video and much much more. A power packed phone with superior performance. Will recommend everyone to buy this. Thank you Samsung.

I shifted to this phone from my Mi 5. The biggest advantage of this phone is OneUI v1.5 (will get 2.0 update in a few months) which is really clean and the system apps of Samsung are so helpful that I don't have to install any third party applications in addition to no ads (unlike MIUI).
Another thing that I love about this device is it's battery life. I don't have to worry about charging it every morning and if I'm ever on low charge, the ultra power saving mode is really helpful.
My reason for buying this phone was the display. Samsung has best displays in the market and there's no doubt in that. I play games, watch movies and read books. It never fails my expectations.
Apart from these, we get regular performance and security updates from Samsung. Having Android 9 Pie out of the box and night mode in a phone with such a great display, battery and software at this price is just off the charts!
Other parameters like performance, camera, storage, boot time, fingerprint unlock, face unlock, speakers, fast charging and accessibility are as smooth/better as they get.
I'm looking forward to Samsung for bringing in more phones like this.

The biggest plus point is its battery life. With 4G data usage the battery lasted me for 3 days on my first full charge.. then and there i was fully satisfied with its monster size battery. Triple rear camera with main lens of 48MP and 123 degree wide angle mode, this phone has the best camera in this price. It functions smoothly without any lags and touch is amazing.. super Amoled display by samsung is undoubtedly the best in its range.
At this price this phone is value for money that too for its branding being under the samsung range it is much more than you can expect.

I am writing this review after using this phone for 2.5 months. The phone has started lagging now. The only good thing about the phone is it's amoled screen. The phone claims to have a 6000 mAh battery but doesn't last that long, probably because of poor ram &amp; battery management. It uses the camera as the proximity sensor which in turn makes things slow as well as more power consuming. The processor seems to be degarding in performance and comes nowhere close to a Snapdeagon processor. Even my old redmi note 3 was much snappier and had a faster fingerprint scanner than this. The camera again disappoints you as even after using a 48 MP primary sensor, samsung isn't able to utilize the sensor probably due to poor camera software and poor optimization. Lastly, I would like to point that the wide angle cam on this phone is useless as it takes photos with too much curved sides and spoils it all. If you want a phone with a good screen and normal day to day usage go for it, otherwise don't even come near it as you'll regret yoir decision seeing other manufacturers provide more than 1.5x performance compared to what this phone offers.

Disappointing. Was split between Redmi note 8 and M30s. Bought M30s since i have been using Mi for a long time and wanted a change. Was not a fan of Samsung because i had heard a few things about samsungs not so premium phones dont perform well but thought ill give it a try.
Started lagging within 1 month the interface gets glitchy and now im having an auto rotate problem. Very disappointing performance. Camera isn't great but not bad either. Simple features like inbuilt app lock or internet speed display isn't available. The phones USP which is huge battery is the only takeaway. Battery backup performace is great. Other than that i have had bad experiences. Would really want to go back in time and get redmi note 8 for the same price.

If you are buying M30s thinking that it's a true 48 megapixel camera then lemme warn you that you will be highly disappointed. It's just a 12 MP camera which combines 4 pixel into 1 using AI. The camera is not even 12 MP, it's 11.7 MP to be precise. Check the screen shots attached.

Samsung has been deceptively marketing it as 48 megapixel smartphone which is not the ACTUAL case. To save itself from exposing, they have even disabled the megapixel adjustment for Pictures and videos in the camera setting. Go to camera and then click setting icon. You will NOT find megapixel adjustment option there.

Deceptive marketing by Samsung:
Camera is just 11.7 MP and NOT 48 MP
Battery is 5830 and NOT 6000 mAh

Battery is good and a full charge could give you a screen time of 12-14 hours, which is the biggest plus point of this phone. 25w fast charger would have be better as the current 15w takes more than 2.5 hours to charge fully. No complaint though.

sAMOLED screen is also good.

Overall, a decent phone for INR 11,600 /-. But if you like to click pictures every now and then then this may not be a good option for you.

Hello friends,
I am giving my honest reviews after using this phone for about 3 weeks and facing some issues on which I want to bring focus.

This phone is a very good phone in terms of speed, display, fingerprint and battery. And it is proving very productive for me .

Few issues I faced like:
1. When I am using single sim, 4g network is always on. But when I am using dual sim, data network is switching between E and then 4g repeatedly many times, which is making hard to use internet while I am doing some important work. I had tested this several times.

2.I have sony bravia w700 Tv. I like to do screen mirroring with my mobile. But this phone is unable to mirror quite smoothly and regularly breaking the video and sound. I believe this problem is there in some samsung mobiles. Reason: before I was using samsung galaxy S4 and it was also unable to screen mirror smoothly. But tell you one thing guys for a comparison, that a redmi 7 phone (rs. 7000 budget phone)mirrors very smoothly. And also I had tested with with several redmi phones they are very effective in screen mirroring.

3. I honestly didn't like the camera, as it was advertised. Yes the reviews of some people are right like camera is like 16 megapixels.

4. This mobile have 6000 mah battery, due to which I believe it is little bit heavy in weight. When I am sitting in a relaxed position I cannot keep it on my chest and use the phone due to the headphone jack. Because its a heavy phone, Samsung should have planned the jack on top.

Other than these points, I am quite enjoying the piece without any lag and I thank Samsung and amazon for making available to us a phone like this in a great budget.

The phone is one of the best in this price range. With 6.4-inch full-HD+ AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels and 6000 mAH battery, you can enjoy uninterrupted high quality video streaming on the phone. I purchased one with 128GM storage with 6GB RAM and I find the processor very fast.
The phone comes with USB Type-C port for fast charging. Once fully charged, the phone battery lasts for more than one day for me with heavy usage. The phone comes with a 15W charger in the box. The 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, and loudspeaker also are on the bottom of the phone. The fingerprint scanner is at the back, next to the camera module, which is easy to reach.
Samsung Galaxy M30s comes with a triple camera setup at the back. Switching between the primary and the wide-angle cameras is easy and can be done using a toggle switch. (Attached photo was shot with my Samsung Galaxy M30s phone.)
M30s is a dual-SIM phone with two Nano-SIM slots and one micro SD Card slot. The phone supports dual 4G SIM as well as VoLTE, Bluetooth 5, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, and the usual sensors.

I have bought this phone after getting tired of my S8 whose battery would last only a couple of hours. This phone till now has given me no problems in terms of battery or performance.

With the huge battery, my worry of constantly being around a charging point is over. The phone easily lasts for a day and a half. I use for listening to songs, whatsapp and browsing mostly. Gaming is not an issue. I have played PUBG, NFS without any lag.

Although, camera i would say is not upto the mark. Samsung definitely could have done better.

In this price range, i would definitely recommend this phone as you get the premium interface that Samsung has to offer. The only thing i wish would have been good to have is the Knox protection and Samsung Pay integrated.

The display Is a gorrila glass 3 ,i bought this phone 2 weeks back accidentally my key hit the display, it created a line crack in the centre of the display , i approached service centre they said it's a physical damage and they will charge you 5k for replacement, hence you have warranty and garrenty they will not replace the glass and display. congratulations samsung on building a super power phone with poor glass display quality...

Was eagerly waiting to buy a new phone after my previous phone (Oneplus 3T) had lived its life. I was considering buying the flagship Oneplus 7T before I came across this phone. The price point was so compelling with these features that I eventually bought it. Have been using it since over 2 months now and here's what I like and dislike.

What I like:
- Price: at 17k it is probably the best phone with amazing features and that too from Samsung (which I trust a lot more over most companies)
- Battery life: I'm not a heavy user but even then a battery life of over 3 days is very convenient
- Camera and display are good (not mind blowing but really good)

What I dislike
- Navigation: My Oneplus seemed very easy to use in terms of short cuts, gestures, placement of buttons, and intuitive-ness. The Samsung interface feels different and takes time to adjust.
- Touch: Not the best

Overall, I would still give it a 5/5 just coz of the price point. As long as such products exist which are value for money, I would never buy an expensive phone even if I can afford it.

Only good thing about the phone is its battery,  good fast charge and  charge stays enough for entire day of continuous calling, and light internet usage.

Rest all is just below average as per specs.
Phone is very very slow and lagging, even for calling features,  never expected this from Samsung,  can u guys imagine how much the phone lags when calling functions are slow and lagged, can even pickup the calls as the phone is not responding.

I am not a gamer or song lover, still I face this issue, I can't even think of how the gamers use this slow and lagging phone,

Please don't buy this phone, this reviews is after horrible experience of 3-4months,
Any one wanna buy this from me?
:( :( :(

I bought this device on 23th Nov'19 and within 2 weeks I faced a miserable issue. While browsing Web, suddenly my phone screen started showing a white light on the left corner. I got a little worried. But before I could even think of doing something, by next morning, the whole screen got white and started showing some weird horizontal lines! Unnecessary I have to plan a visit to the nearest service center now.

This phone is also also having issues with Network Reception, Camera Quality and OS speed. Other people also pointed out here but I ignored thinking different people use the device differently and I should be able to use it wisely. But everything went haywire and the phone is good as dead for me right now.

Friendly suggestion: DON'T BUY this device. It has got some serious design &amp; manufacturing defects.

Phone is fast and responds to everything you throw at it..best thing is its screen quality..you just can't take your eyes of it..
Also it is a slim phone, height to width ration is great for single hand use..
Comes with samsung ARemoji..which is fun..
With m30s comes 6000mah battery..I tend to forget to charge it..
Face recognition is amazing at this price level..just crisp..

Doesn't matter what kind of user you are,  as it fulfills almost everything..

I wish Samsung had phone case included in the box.. that would have been amazing..

Best budget smart phone in this segment. For day today use this phone serves the purpose well.
Found issues with camera, applications lags and switching from back to front camera takes more than 15 to 20 seconds. This spoils the user experience. Not sure if this is just a issue in my mobile or it's a bug in all m30s devices.

The wide angle camera is spectacular - GoPro alag se nahi lena padega Ladakh ride k liye. The usual one is just meh... 48MP like seriously? Battery will last you for the full Ladakh trip (6000 mAH and gets even better with network turned off) . The screen is stellar . Shines even brighter through my bifocals. Supports the full HD OTA Video experience. The back is a smudge magnet but the colors are beautiful! Buy this with an exchange and instantemi and you'll never regret it ... unless,of course you drop it .. because the phone protection case needs to be bought separately.

Please do not buy this phone, Sumsung is claiming the false statement that it can last up to 29* hrs of Video playback, Normal use battery is last up to 16 to 18 hrs only. (Normal use means, some whats app, few minutes call, few minutes video only). Check the screen shot after 100% charging the battery - It shows only 18 hrs and 40 minutes. I don't understand why Samsung is claiming the false battery life (29hrs video playback, 40+ hrs music, 130+ hrs voice call)

Amazon should check the product before they put this on sell.

Cameras (Front and Back) are ok.

I am very very disappointed with this device.

Amazon please help me to resolve my issue.

COMING TO EVERY POINT ONE BY ONE FOR VERY HONEST REVIEW :
1)Build Quality :Its body design and material is quite usual and not so strong but is very good at this price along with other features.
2) Screen to body ratio:Its screen to body ratio is good and same as shown in picture.
3) Finger Reader : Its fast and respond quickly. Its multifunctional as it can be used to slide notification panel.
4) Camera Quality : The best feature of this phone is camera quality. It has 3 cameras one for 48MP pictures,another one for depth sensing and last one for wide angle pictures. Overall its really good, you can go for it blindly. Additionally it has AR lens along with AI effects and many exciting features.
5) Battery Life: The most powerful and fantastic ability of this phone is that it can last upto 4 days maximum with no Internet or just low usage of internet and with full usage of apps and data it can last for 1.5 to 2 days easily.
Overall, you can go for this phone if you want an average range phone with good camera and long lasting battery life.

It is the best phone available in the market in this range. What u get is much more than what u pay.

From technical view point I find some lagging in the phone sometimes but as u know the price is low this is the best thing I got in this range.

The worst thing is phone's body material. I have a white colored phone and it is prone to scratches and dirt. Very hard to maintain and even if it drops down from a small height there is a tendency to leave dent marks.

So no to white colored m30s and try to take a cover as soon as you buy the phone.

Best thing is if you are a high content consumer say 8hr per day the battery will last for 30 hrs

But if you use your phone onlt for phone calls and facebook, whatsapp n youtube the battery may last upto 40hrs which is amazing.

It takes 2 hrs to fully charge your phn.

Coming to camera the quality is good. Best pictures are clicked on pro mode. Somewhere I didn't like the selfie much but better than other phones available in the market.

It's been 5 months till now I m enjoying.

The body is compact and shiny. It has metal casing for protecting 3 rear cameras. Nothing is there to protect front display which is a compromise for this price. Finger sensor is excellent. Side volume and power buttons are solid too.
It has awesome AMOLED display superior to other LCDS. Camera is good but takes time to focus. Low light performance is average. Video recording is smooth. Limitation of 10 mins 4k video recording.
It has monster battery alongwith super fast charging. The processor is good with 2.4 GB spare RAM to carry out day-to-day activities.
I have tried playing PUBG on this phone and results are good but little disappointed with phone graphics as HD graphics cannot be used for gameplay.

Had a lot of expectations from this product, this kind of quality and performance is available with Redmi note 5 pro which is almost half the price. UI also better for RMN 5 pro, yet to test camera. Given the chance will return the product. Charging cable is so short that you need to buy new cable immediately. Transparent back cover not included in accessory And not available in market too. If you like Samsung UI then it's a good product but if you are new better try something else

Hai All,
Using Samsung M30s for the last one week and here are pros and cons which I felt,
Pros -
1) Superb Battery backup.It has big 6000MAH battery and clearly it is showing the power capacity of 6000mah.
2)Display- It comes with Amoled display. I bet no other mobile in this range will have a better display than M30s.You can watch movies at it's best visual beauty.
3) Eventhough it has 6000 Mah battery,we will never feel any weight and it is comfort to handle.Better never use without a back cover as back part is made up of comparitively light material.
4)I have not felt any lag as of now.Apps are working smoothly
5)Sound quality is good and have Dolby Atmos option which give you top quality sound effect when connected to bluetooth speaker or headphone
Cons-
1) It comes with 48 mp rear cam.Under low light the performance is not up to the mark and it takes some time to process the photo after we take it

Final word - You can go for it without a second  thought.Best phone under 15k segment and that too from the quality makers of mobile Samsung.

The M30s has been a very pleasant  experience coming  in with the massive battery,  superb display and the One UI experience.  The phone feels very light to hold and carry around. Aesthetically  the dual color adds some freshness to the look.
Fingerprint  scanner  is good and I prefer it to the on screen scanner which sometimes has a delays..
Speaker volume could have been louder.
Gaming is great with the Game mode turned on. A smooth experience.
The fast charging  works really well and 1.5 hours is all it takes from 20 to 100. Battery juice lasts for a day and more with good interaction.
The OTG sadly does not work when I plug in a dual drive or OTG cable. Surprised. Samsung  care has no answer to this. It works on another M30S which I bought.But connectivity to the PC and charging is very responsive.  Samsung to address this as many users are facing this problem.
Watching videos, pictures is a great experience.
Camera works great and pictures and warm and vivid.
Video shoots are good.
Overall a cracker of a phone and the best in its class.
At this price range Samsung has re created the competitive  buzz amongst other players with it's fantastic screen and matching specs.

1. Look

The curved edges, glossy finish back with mixed sky blue and black colour combination makes the look attractive.

2. Camera

The 48MP ultra wide camera with live focus and night vision function makes camera perfect.

3. Battery (The heart of phone)

The monster batter with 6K MAH capacity makes phone more powerful. And with fast charger around in 2 hrs it get fully charged. Another good thing about battery is even though the size of battery capacity lies above 5.5K the phone doesn't heat.

4. Processing

One UI Core processor, 6GB Ram and android 9 operating system makes phone faster.

5. Overall

Due to I have sweating problem sometimes fingerprint sensor doesn't work properly.

The auto brightness mode is more comfortable in light and dark vision.

Overall, at the price range of 14 to 17K the phone is totally 'Paisa Vasool'. I will suggest
 to buy this product to those who hate power banks, cheap looks.

(4.5/5)

The build quality is good overall, the phone isnt slim but good and bit bulky. The camera is good shooter in good lighting and outdoor conditions, didn't tested yet in night. The battery is a giant but charging isn't really fast which is a con, i expected it would charge from 20 to 100 within 1hr 30min but it took almost more than 2 hrs. The display is good and touch is also fine. Face unlock works surprising fast and fingerprint unlock is good too. You will get 100 fb storage for use out of 128 gb which is not bad at all with 512 gb sd card support.  The sound quality is good and it supports Dolby atmos if you use headphones wired or wireless. Overall good phone with only one thing less which is fast charging.

I'm posting this review after 1 week of usage.
Pros:
1. Battery life. 2 days of battery life for normal usage. 5-6 hrs for heavy gaming.
2. Display. This S Amoled display is amazing. Touch feedback works like a charm. Widevine DRM certified! Can do HD streaming in Amazin Prime Video. Loving it.
3. Camera. Good enough for the price u r investing. Under good lighting, pictures come out real good. Play through features like wide angle, slow-mo, etc.,
4. Design. Feels premium in hand. 'A' series is better in terms of design. But this doesn't disappoint.
5. Price. I got it for 15.6k on offer. And I'm totally happy.

Cons:
I couldn't really find anything. Good enough for a student. But I did feel some heat near the camera during gaming. Secure folder and some apps are missing though . I dunno y they disabled it.

Verdict. It's surely an amazing phone for the price. Samsung is back in the midrange segment. Sure winner. Just go for it.

User experience is far rich on this phone
Great set of hardware and software in one phone makes it irresistable...
Pros:
CAMERA (5/5)
  Photos are great Primary and Ultra Wide
  Videos best in class use of both lenses with slo-mo super slo-mo steady and ultra steady Modes ... The Best
BATTERY(more than 5/5)
  Why is humongous 6000 mAmps with 15 Watts charge in the box!!!
SCREEN (5/5)
  6.5inch Super AMOLED display best is just one word but this is the only phone in this price segment ROCKING ... seeing videos ...reading punchy colours

Cons : Its actually a Pro but still listed it in con  Heating Issue ... It's not heating ... I mean it was at stating but got an update the next day and after update it's not at all heating the update of gamebooster has greatly improved gaming experience now.
Ultimately this phone has the best chip , camera, battery and further software updates are actually improving a lot of functions.. it's a flagship level phone ...
I will recommend it ... Best buy
Ultrawide is really wide in video is GoPro kind of experience.

Samsung Galaxy M30S is a overall good mobile under 17k but the camera quality is below average. I gave it one star coz there is no option for 0 star in review. I would like to request Samsung that the company should be honest while advertising the product. The monster camera is just the name, camera quality is really bad like a 8 megapixel camera, photo are blurry and has a lot noise in the pictures.
If anyone want a camera mobile then the A series in Samsung is way better then this or you can go for vivo z1x or realme xt etc.
I'm not happy with this purchase coz camera is a mandatory part of mobile and I'm disappointed with this phone in camera quality.

The phone is genuine value for money. I am very happy with the phone. The battery life is amazing.
Lasts more than 2 days after a single charge. It also charges swiftly as it has a wider charging pin. .within half an hour you are done for 2 days. The camera clarity is amazing. The videos and photos download very fast and have an HD clarity.The fingerprint reader works very well. I am very happy with the face detector and don't have to make cumbersome procedures to unlock screen. It has  options to choose from which number to place a call. All in all..i give it 5 plus

Being an Android user for last 5 years, I always found battery was the biggest concern for me as I had to charge my mobile everyday to keep it running. 6000 mah battery was my biggest motivator to  buy this mobile. Being a moderate user and Samsung fan, I found this mobile very good. It is smooth in operation, has good battery life and has awesome display. Only con this phone has is its average camera, both front and back. Overall it's a good phone and I am happy about it as I got it at a good price. Thank you Amazon and STPL seller!

I am writing this review after about 3 weeks of usage. I got this phone for about 11600 after the card discount and the Amazon pay cashback. For that price I feel that this is the best deal out there.
I will be dividing this review into pros and cons.

PROS
1. The battery.
This is the main USP of this phone. A 6000 mAh Mammoth battery. The battery can last for 2 days + for casual users. I am kind of a heavy user so it lasts for one day for me. I get around 9-12 hours of SOT ( depends on the settings I've set, using both sims). I'd say this is extremely good as I live in a place where the network reception is pretty poor and that tends to affect the battery a lot.
2. The Display
The next big thing about this phone. The display is the best under the 20k category. The display gets bright enough for outdoor use although it's not too bright. It is very pleasing to watch HD content in this phone. The always on display is something I really like and AOD is present in this phone.

3. Processor
The exynos 9611 is a huge upgrade over the m30's processor which is exynos 7904.
The 9611 CPU power is comparable to the 710 and 712. The phone manages around 150k on Antutu and 1400 in multicore Geekbench 5 benchmark. Although the benchmarks doesn't say the full picture, the performance for day to day tasks was buttery smooth and app opening times was quick due to the UFS 2.1 storage. The Ram management is pretty good in this phone.
While for gaming, I've played pubg and Cod for a while and played both at high settings. Cod was very smooth and didn't face any lags, although playing pubg on hdr setting resulted in minor frame drops here and there, but it wasn't much of an issue. The Mali G72- mp3 isn't as powerful as the Adreno Gpu found in SD 710 And 675, but manages games smoothly.

4. Software
I used to own xiaomi phone, and I always used to put a launcher since I hated MIUI, but I used the one UI on this phone and that was a very good experience. It's a major upgrade over the experience UI used in budget Samsung phones. The gamebooster is a very useful for people who game a lot. There are lots of customizable options in one UI and the night mode is great.

5. Back Camera
 The back camera in this device is very good and takes great shots in daytime and well lit indoor conditions. The 48mp although doesn't bring much difference apart from the file size(almost 15mb). The ultra wide camera captures more area compared to other ultrawides in this price segments. The night mode is decent. Live focus or portrait mode does a great job. The super steady mode is Handy if you're someone who shoots videos

6. Sound output
The sound output is pretty loud and it comes with Dolby Atmos and that makes listening to audio via headphones more better.

7. Best Customer support.

Cons
1. Front Camera
The 16mp front camera performance during my usage was pretty bad. The camera tends to over soften the picture resulting in loss of details. The live focus on the front camera is good.

2. The fingerprint reader is good,but it's bit slow compared to other phones at this price.
Also, since Samsung is using an amoled screen hoped that they went for an indisplay reader.

3. Google Camera
This con can be ignored , but for some people this is important. Since the phone uses exynos processor, Google camera port for this phone may not come, even if it does it'll me missing important features like night sight and portrait.

4. Lack of ambient light sensor.
This phone uses the front camera to sense light, so when you turn on auto brightness, the front camera senses light. This takes a huge toll on the battery and took about 7-12 % of the overall battery life.

5. Updates
Although this phone will be getting the Android 10 update, the question is when. Samsung has a poor record of updates for their budget phones. Let's hope it changes.

Purchased from Amaton day 1 and got immediate delivery next day. The cameras are extremely good. In my recent trip to Hinaly@1200 feet, I rarely used my DSLR and depended on M30S only. It gives excellent results including Slow motion videos.  The battery is a real monster. I had no connectivity in the mountains and the phone was constiin serach mode. Despite that, the battery lasted for 36 hours or more and charges very fast. A real gem.

M30s is a far better when you compare to other Chinese brands...display clarity is awesome...finger print sensor is highly effective...camera quality is good but not up to 48MP...battery life is too good...last for 3 days of app usage...overall price is reasonable...this phone is worth to buy in all almost all aspects....👍👍👍

Battery life is very poor and camera quality is too.
I had buy this product on 20 January 2020. Now within 5 months battery discharge in 6 to 7 hr and camera quality that much poor.

 when I compare it with MI 8 note with (variant 10000 RS) the colour quality of Samsung(128*6 GB) camera was not up to the mark and on the other hand I am I give much better quality camera and battery of that MI note is also so good

I have purchased samsung galaxy m30s and it's been my primary device since last 2 months
PROS:- 1.)Display❤
2.)Battery❤
3.)Samsung ONE UI 1.5 is feature loaded with lots of customization (I am android one UI fan but i am i am in love with ONE UI)❤
4.)Camera's colour output (I have seen my phone's camera pictures on other devices by sharing them)❤
5.)Gaming (Call of duty)❤
6.)UFS 2.1 storage (Speed of read and write)❤
7.)Weight management of device❤
8.)Ram management(I have 6gb+128gb variant)❤
9.)Multitasking❤
10.)Performance of device (It is even more improved after receiving third system update including security patch level update of 319.46mb)❤
CONS:- Ummmmm
I haven't encountered with any till now😁
NOTE:- I was using Xiaomi's Redmi Note series since last 3 years because Samsung was not giving these monster specifications at that time and I am a Samsung fan now. Now I think quality of Xiaomi's devices in terms of software is way far then Samsung's devices
VERDICT:- I love my samsung galaxy m30s❤💯

I'm writing this after using the phone for more than a month now.
As most others have said the positives are its display, battery and its looks to somewhat.
Following are the main disadvantages or negatives in using this phone.
Cons:
1. Network coverage -&gt; This phone is not detecting the network well. I've used the same simcard in my old in the same location, I hadn't faced any issues. This phone really sucks. Sometimes even if the coverage point shows full other person would not be able to hear you. This really irritates me.
2. Fingerprint reader -&gt; Poor. Most of the times unresponsive.
3. Camera
4. Fast Charging -&gt; Taking really long time to charge full. Don't know how they advert this as fast charging.
5. Phone performance -&gt; After I restored my old data this phone is not very fast. Hangs very often. My phone hanged more than 3-4 times over the past month.
6. Sound -&gt; This is the biggest minus in this phone. Very less sound from speakers. Even in earphones its not that great.

I would not recommend this phone.

I'M LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED WHEN COMING TO CAMERA IN M30S. BECAUSE THE COMPETITORS IN THIS SEGMENT GIVING QUAD CAMERA WITH MACRO SENSOR OPTION AND ALSO PERFECT EDGE DETECTION BOKEH (PORTRAITS) .

 AND COMING TO PROCESSOR SAMSUNG HAVE TO GIVE OPTIONS TO CUSTOMERS 2 VARIANTS (EXSYNOS 9611/ SNAPDRAGON 675 ) LIKE THAT .

COMING TO BATTERY LIFE IT IS SOO EXCELLENT IN SAMSUNG WHERE NO ONE IN THIS SEGMENT GIVING SUCH POWERFUL AND LONG LASTING BATTERY

FINGERPRINT SENSOR IS SATISFACTION FOR ME. IT IS QUICK BUT SOME BRANDS HAVING AMOLED DISPLAY IN THIS SEGMENT GIVING IN SCREEEN FINGERPRINT. BUT SAMSUNG FAILED TO DEPLOY IT

THIS IS MY HONEST REVIEW FOR M30S  AND I'M USING M30S 6/128 VARIANT FOR THE LAST 1 MONTH

I cannot stress enough how good this phone is. It's a Masterpiece which Samsung Launched in this price range and it looks like the company has already made an Statement with this device.

Some of the Great Features are-:

1) The Biggest Asset is the Huge Battery life. It will last you for all your daily use with 80% charge including gaming,maps,music,etc.

2) The screen is amazing which is Samsung's trump.

3) Camera's are Amazing all of them. The 48 MP is a Beast with a lot of detail. The wide angle is also Great with providing a different aspect with minimal loss to detail. The selfi camera is pretty decent as well.

4) The Storage and the Ram provided at this Price point is something I have been waiting for with Samsung and it's enough for every. You can also increase the storage with external Micro SD Cards as it's not Hybrid slot.

5) I also love the color. Its such a nice Gradient and a different color.

However Great this Phone is, there are a some cons which are minimal but noticeable

1) The processor is not as fast as the Snapdragon though it's not all that noticeable if heavy gaming is not done.

2) The speaker sound could have been a little louder.

That's pPretty Much my review for this Phone. Samsung definitely surprised me with this phone packing so much power and performance in a mid range phone and i think anyone looking for a great phone should look to buy this.
Hope this helps.

System gets heat up..

Does not get network coverage at most parts.

 Internet doesn't work properly,4G works slow in this device as respect to already using device (realme2pro)

Back panel is making noise when held in hand. Every time when I pick my Device there is some noise from back panel. Seems like backpanel is not fitted properly.

Selfie Camera quality is not good. Rear camera quality is not as per the MP camera sensor provided.

I would say that while selecting my new mobile phone I was absolute sure to buy Nokia 8.1 because of its camera, sound, graphics and battery life values but as soon I saw Samsung M30 in comparison I found the features are much more enhanced and battery life is just mindblowing.
Pros-
Extremely great mega pixels cameras
Battery life is just mindblowing
Two processor are simply enhanced for unbeeat performance
Screen size 6.18 edged display, perfect to watch any movie etc.
Sound quality is extremely wow
Bluetooth is absolute latest 5.0with good range
GPU Mali G72 MP3- which provides good performance
4 GB Ram extremely helpful

So all in all I changed my choice from Nokia 8.1 to Samsung M30 and simply happy to receive this just next day as my New Year Gift.
Thank you Samsung.

Finger print sensor is not much good as other mobiles, many times its fails. But we have face unlock its too good unlocking very fastly even in low light so i am not using finger print mostly.
Battery- awasome performance.  Morning charged 100% after whole day normal usage (youtube, bluetooth connected entire day, mobile data on, whatsapp, music and etc) night i could see 55%. Really its have long last battey.
Camera quality- front camera awesome  for selfi and video. Rear camera is good for photo. I am not able to record hd video, its normal quality. Slow motion videos good.
Display- always samsung display is good. This phone also have very good display, good user interface. But after paste the tempered glass touch is not good i think its tempered glass issue, need to replace  it.

I am using Samsung M30 S  from last 4 weeks.
This is really a great mobile phone with 6GB RAM ,128GB Storage space and amazing battery life . Fingerprint sensor works smoothly.Camera quality is very good super slow motion and slow motion is fantastic but  low light photography is not up to the mark and there is no front flash.
But in the price range of 16k to 17 k this is no doubt a best choice.For performence I can give 5 out of 5.

Wonderful product by Samsung and excellent delivery by Amazon. This is by far the best phone released by Samsung at this price and it's clearly a winner in this market. With high grade specifications and a trustworthy brand name,  Samsung Galaxy m30s sets a new standard for future mobile sets in Indian markets.

Having a 6GB/128GB handset with an unmatchable 6000mah battery and a FHD+ display all the while measuring new heights with super stable video capture and a 48MP triple cam is not only rare but next to impossible if one looks at an inexpensive 17000 RS price tag.

After 10 days of usage, one would fall in love with the system wide night mode, blue light filter, Dolby atmos sound system, end to end Infinity display and more.

With quick access fingerprint reader and a face unlock feature, this phone is one of the most secure handsets in the world. What more? It even has an emergency factory data reset feature in case the phone gets stolen. So no worries people, ur data is forever safe.

I bought this phone few days ago and was impressed with camera and build, however, from few days onwards the speakers started giving me a problem. Most of the time it doesn't work, mean no volume. Suddenly, volume comes back. Initially I thought some software issue and will be fine after updates but no the issue persists and is killing the whole experience.
The return policy is no longer available, though its been not even a month for me when I bought.
What I believe now, this has happened with me second time in 2 months, from Amazon. First on laptop flicking screen, goes black suddenly and now with phone. So, better buy these electornic things from proper stores or atleast first visit store and examine the product properly.
I suspect, there seem not proper authenticity on these online portals now.
Be alert!!

Mind blowing product.
Samsung deserves their job for budget mobiles same like other mobiles.
Thing is its not like 48mp. It is average camera.
Little bit mobile has heavy weight but we will not feel that.
Almost everything is fine and its like super man in this price range.
Pros and cons are same like what others mentioned.
Based on daily usage my observation on this mobile is 70% pros and 30% cons.
We have to use carefully because there is no protection or gorilla glass.once drop to screen side face screen will damage.
Because it's heavy battery mobile the more pressure will occur on screen while drops screen face.

Finally budget mobile and daily usage.
Not for heavy pro gamers.

Keep you update any cons!!!

There is no point rating this mobile M30s below 4. I am using this mobile since October, 2019. It is indeed added with all necessary features which are very helpful. Display is crystal clear. The phone is very handy to use. 
 Bought opal black color, that's looking very unique and rich.
 The best part: 1) Gaming is a good experience because of the strong Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. 2) Powerful battery back up with 6000 maH LiOn battery. 3) End to end 6.04 amouled screen. 4) it doesn't hang and booting is smooth after restart. 5) Sound quality and voice clarity is good. I am satisfied and it a must try over other phones in this range.
6) OS Part, One Ui is very good in terms of features and lightweight on hardware
7)Timely updates given by Samsung.
I'm very happy with the purchase. Totally satisfied.

Pros👍
Very responsive touchscreen
Great looks
Camera placement
Picture quality one of the best, I would say mindblowing 🤩 Do see my sample pictures.
sAmoled Screen
Awesome night photo in this range of phone
Sound quality
Best part is battery life, I have installed a lot of applications in my phone and use almost 80% of them daily, with wifi and data both switched on I am getting almost 1.5 to 2 whole days of battery backup on 100% charge.

Cons👎
Fingerprint sensor is little slow and you can actually feel the lag sometimes.
Fast charging needs to be a little more fast 😆

But other than these I didn't found any othe negative point.

I would definitely recommend buying this phone if someone is looking to buy a phone within a range of 12 to 15K.

I bought it for almost 11,500 after all discounts and cashback during the Amazon's  Great India Sale.

Have been using the phone for more than two weeks now and I must say I am quite impressed with the phone.

1. The display is awesome, gets bright enough to use outside.
2. One UI works as expected. Night Mode works awesome.
3. Battery is the biggest advantage in this phone with 6000mAh, easily gets me through 1 day with heavy usage. Using Dark mode saves battery too, since it is an OLED display. Fast charging is good, it takes a little more than 2 hours for full charge - that's totally fine for the amount of time it can last.
4. Did not find any issues with phone's performance, memory management is very good with One UI.
5. I saw a lot of reviews saying the camera does not look like a 48MP camera. By default the camera takes 12MP shots, but this can be changed with changing the Aspect ratio in Camera app at the top. In good lighting conditions, the camera performs quite well for me and Ultrawide gives new perspectives. In low light, camera does not perform that well. Also the camera's pro mode does not have manual controls for Focus and Shutter speed, that is a Con for me as I tend to use that while taking photos(should not be a problem for many).

Overall it is a good buy, did not find much Cons, because bought this phone knowing the limitations. I do not game or use really high processing power apps, so did not find the processor lagging or RAM being insufficient. Always had around 2GB of memory free(6GB variant). The OneUI takes some time to get used to, but has been really good to use. If you feel the colours are not up to mark on the display, then set the Screen Mode under Display to Vivid. I got it for Rs. 15,300 which was a very good deal for the 6GB variant with the SBI card offer.

For a price of 15k phone plus branding of Samsung, didnt expect this much EMPOWERMENT (48MP triple cam, 6000mah, 6+128gb, external slot for Mem card).
Camera seems to be quite decent. Not any issues if you compare it with A50s. Rear cam for both phones works similar way in almost every mode. You can check comparison videos on Youtube, but donot check comparison with other flagship phones.
Camera's Wide angle mode is too great and even checked it with other brands.
Battery performance - Quite upto the mark. Checked it while playing Games, and Standby with Bluetooth &amp; wifi enabled. Provides Almost 15hrs a day when playing games and Standby with Bluetooth would easily run for 1 and half days.
Overall too Good purchase for the price. Only issue is Plastic Back cover and should have added In-Display Fingerprint sensor instead of Rear.

On papers configuration are very good. After using for 2 weeks (6GB/128GB) here are my review--
1) Performance/display is very good
2) Battery as expected.. good life but take around 3.5 hrs to fulm charge with its fast charger.
3) Camera quality is good however sometimes when you plan for group photo(15-20 faces)it is unable to capture with default pic mode. Its bad for group photo.. as msg come from camera unable to zoom.. so effectively when camera senes 20 faces it actually get confused. I was pressed button to click but it is giving  msg unable to zoom.
3) mobile is fast. Good resolution big screen just like any other 25-30k phone.
4) its touch is good but sometimes it's give us feeling that touch is ok ok not excellent(not as per my earlier phone oneplus 2).
5) overall good for this price.

The phone is good for the price range. The battery life is great, can easily last 1 day while travelling,  watching videos and using the internet. The fingerprint reader is fine but it takes a little time to get used to the reader being at the back of the phone .

As for the camera quality, I am a little disappointed. I was using one Plus 3T before and the camera experience was much better. Samsung M30s camera images seem to be a little soft edged and not as sharp, the camera is slow to focus and the wide angle feature is also not that great .

I also prefer the pure android experience available with Google pixel, one Plus, Moto G etc which is missing here. Tol many promotional apps etc keep coming up.
The battery life, and screen are the biggest Plus points .

I am using this phone for a last 25-30 days, And here is my full review.
Start with PROS:
1. battery life: the usp of this phone is its battery life, it lasts 1.5 to 2 days in one charge (note that, i am not a gamer but binge web series for 2 to 3 hrs daily)
2. Display: The display just outperforms its every competitor for this price range(e.g MI,Realme)
3. Performance: Hasn't find any lag till date, so it might be good enough for everyone.
4. Camera: Rear camera setup for this phone is really good, especially its nightmode and wide angle.

Cons:
1.front camera is just ordinary.
2.not a gamer centric phone.

Conclusion::
This phone is nearly perfect for u if u consume lot of stuffs from youtube, Netflix etc. But if you are gamer than you should find other options.

Not working properly, the mobile is too slow and can't be used for big sized or untrusted  applications and the battery capacity is 6000mAh (as per the comapny) but does not last for a single day it does not give that much life as the company claims of. This mobile has good camera but it is not that suitable for night time or in dark. I'm not satisfied with this mobile.

Firstly Pros :
1. In this price range i can't find any other better one that samsung m30s.
2 The amoled display for this price ranging is simply unbelievable.
3. The best part is the Battery life, whoa man you can praise with your whole regarding battery life. There isn't or may be there won't be a mobile with brand and standard with this much battery life in this range.
4. Cam, you can say that cam is good considering the pricing of this mobile.

Cons
Finger print is not upto the mark. When i have added the second fingerprint, it works good for sometimes, but sometimes it doesn't work at all.
Cam : There should be some development in portrait mode, i can see that its not upto the mark in this section as specified by samsung.

Final review: Trust me this is the best smartphone that can be bought for that price from the most trusted smartphone brand out there.

SAMSUNG - YOU ROCKED AT LAST.

The phone got delivered with standard two day delivery. The packaging was poor on Amazon's part but luckily the box and device were not damaged whatsoever. The phone has an exceptional display- you may compare the same with the flagship S and Note series phones. The built quality is fine, but the plastic back squeaks now and then while holding at certain angles. The battery life is above average but still I'm getting only 28 - 32 hours of very light usage, maybe that'll improve with the coming charge cycles. Also the day light images taken from the phone are of good quality but a little over saturated. The fingerprint sensor works fine but the fingers need to be clean. There is no screen protector or silicon case provided with the phone and hence you need to buy one as soon as possible or there are chances that the display may break. Also I got free one year screen replacement service by Acko free of cost when I bought in the first sale of Amazon on 29th September. With all the discounts, it cost me ₹11,599 which is quite good for the phone. PUBG could run in HDR settings at Ultra Frame rate which I saw only in Poco F1.
I totally recommend this phone.
P.S. I bought it for my dad as his first smart phone. Have a nice day!

Pros - Battery backup is mind blowing, sAMOLED display is amazing, one UI is fantastic, Samsung brand quality
Cons - Camera is average..may be Samsung need to patch it up..no 48MP clarity, the photos are pixelated and hazy when you zoom in to check the clarity..even my Nokia 6.1 plus with gcam installation gives me fantastic pics quality...Ads are another big irritant and some pretty installed apps though one can uninstall them...finger print reader is okay but not lightening fast

And sound is OK on speaker.
And can experience Dolby support on earphones.
I give 4/5 rating for this product.
Camera is very doubtful. Doesn't look like 48mp camera.
Need updates to make even better one.

Initially I thought it to be like any other phone, but after using it for 4-5 days I really find the difference.

》Battery《: Just super, even if you r continuously using it for 4-5 hours of general browsing, 1-2 hrs of video n 1 hour of music, still the battery will easily go for 2+ days.
》Camera《: Nice pic quality, haven't really tried low light photography. Selfies are cool n clear, objects near u r not blurry but distant objects r blurred during selfie.
》Internet Speed《: This is kinda strange, I found some remarkable diff. in internet speed compared to earlier phone. Web browsing is smooth n fast.
》Face Unlock《: It good n fast, no issues there, but ensure, enough light falls on your face else it may not recognize.

Its a great device from Samsung. Overall it offers great performance. Let me write the pros and cons.
Pros:
1. Really long Battery life-60000mAh. So it ensures non-stop gaming and entertainment.

2. Amazing display. Since it comes with the sAmoled display, it's gives those nice viewing angles, punchy colors in a video.

3. The processor- Being powered by Exynos 9611 SOC, it ensures high end gaming. For example-it supports extreme frame rate on PUBG Mobile and it truly works on those settings without any major lags.

Fingerprint Scanner- Its decent. The good thing is that, it works even if you have slight moisture on your fingers.

Camera- Pretty decent camera. I really liked the Wide angle lens and it works even in video mode. But I feel the primary camera sensor needs some improvement. I hope Samsung improves its quality via OTA updates.

Cons
1. Heats up quickly while gaming. However reducing the graphics and frame rate helps solving the issue.

2. No notification LED

3. Lack of customizations in the Ui. However The Notification Panel has some amazing quick toggles which I found to be really usefull.

4. Primary camera sensor needs improvement.

5. Face unlock is little slow.

Absolutely love what Samsung has done to bring the m series line of phones into the market. It's exactly what the the indian youth need who gives a great deal of respect for beefed up specs and loves having a high capacity battery and fast charging time. Phone makers like samsung have finally started to realise that the youth is indifferent to brands and like to try new things and technology like wireless charging and retinal identification on their phones but at the same time do not want to sacrifice on the performance of the phone and would even appreciate a minimalist look for their phone.
As much as us young people like to flex flashy tech, we don't always have the b***s to use an expensive phone without a back case, because for it is screams "I'm about to crack", and we don't mind using cases either, cuz why not, there's so many fun designs to choose from.
In my personal opinion, I belive phone makers could hugely popularise an option where customers could choose from affordable custom designs for the back of the phone which means everyone gets a chance for self-expression and wouldnt have to resort to non durable phone cases instead. Having said that, I personally feel Samsung's M series give a lot of bang for the buck compared in its price segment.
Let's go samsung 1 trillion club.

Received the phone today morning. Updated and transferred files and apps from my oppo f9pro by using Samsung smart switch app on both the phones. Till now everything seems to be as given in details of the product. Will give another update after two weeks usage. As of now l rate it as an excellent mobile. Excellent camera. The rear camera really gives excellent 48 megapixel but do change the settings in the camera app. Don't panic if in the beginning while transferring apps and files and updating the phone seems to heatup but after restarting the problem disappears. Excellent set wonderful go for it. Plus the price discount by amazon and the packing and delivery is amazing!  Go for it guys!!!

As name #GoMonster, I am so glad that this time Samsung bring things out of the box.

Camera: awesome camera, I think this is better than most of the phone in that segment.

Battery backup: I have used it for continues 2 days but still there 13 % left and on top of that ultra-power saving mode is killer, love it.

Display: I loved it so much because the crystal-clear videos and photo even in sunlight wow.

One-UI -I was hardcore user of stock android but this is something beyond, best for one handed uses and very nice customization that I loved.

Another thing I loved in this phone inbuild Samsung Max VPN that is double layer of protection from threat and hacking.

In total I would say, I loved this phone and it is the best among other on this price range .

Thanks Samsung and amzon for this wonderfull product and on wonderfull price with amzon cash back and SBI card offer.

1. Phone's battery is its main USP, it can run 1.5-2 days depending on one's usage. Despite being a 6000 mah battery, the phone doesn't feels very heavy.

2. Talking about Camera, its 48 mp can be sometimes a little hazy, wide angle camera is just ok, camera is primarily set on 12 mp which shots nice images.

3. Video quality is good, super slow motion is fantastic.

4. Phone is not having heating issues and performs well for everyday use, but its not meant for intense gaming &amp; heavy multitasking.

5. Phone's design &amp; build quality is not something which can make you a fan of it, given the price, features &amp; brand name, somewhere the sacrifices have to be made.

6. Super AMOLED display is something which made me inclined to buy this phone as compared to its competition, this would have been much more better if gorilla glass protection was used.

7. With respect to the box contents, either earphones or phone cover should have been provided.

After 1 month of usage
Awesome mobile got for exchanging an old redmi phone
I must say the amloid experience is worth
Although didn't receive any case along with the box but overall it's a quality product
Ring volume is pretty much audible even in heavy traffic net connectivity is fast
Picture quality is awesome
So is the sound quality
All the modes work well front sensor is pretty accurate
Gaming is good although I am  not a gamer
The battery will last with light usage for 2 days with single charge .
Charging with the original charger and not depending on power banks is crucial
Till now no glitches faced
And yes lightning delivery.recieved it within 20 hours

I just bought a new phone Samsung M30s.  After charging, I switched on the phone and navigated through installation. During the installation, the phone switched off. I am not able to switch on the phone or reset (Power Button &amp; Volume+ button).  I am concerned about the quality of the phone.

Called Amazon tech support. Tried the reset over the phone. No luck. In addition, Amazon has only replacement policy for mobile phones. That is fine. But Amazon initiates the replacement only after technician visits to your place for inspecting the phone and raises the report which could take days. If you are in emergency to replace the broken mobile by ordering on Amazon, good luck.

Though I am buying the phones for last few years on Amazon, this is a very bitter and miserable experience.

Hence, order only when you are not in a hurry to replace the broken mobile;  pray that the new phone you receive it works;  Otherwise it is a painful process to get the replacement which I am currently going thro'.

This is one of the best midrange phones available at this point of time.
Following are some of my review comments:
1. The camera is at par with most of the high end phones available including the one plus 6 and 6t.
2. Their is no issue that I have faced on connectivity so far and I have been using the phone for a couple of months now.
3. I am using a samsung phone after quite sometime and I like the features like smart view mostly because my smart tv is also a samsung product.
4. The back panel is weak so if you dont use a back cover it might be irritating to hear the squeaking sound everytime to hold the phone tight.
5. The display is one of the best I have used.
6. The processor might lag sometimes but is worth the price that you are paying for it.
7. I am not a gamer but battery is an important factor for me and this is a monster in that respect.

Summary: If battery, camera and display are your major points of emphasis. This is a very good buy in the 12-15 range.

I started to use this phone about 15 days back and what a change. It has all the features of various expensive phones.
1. Batter life is sufficient for two days for normal use. Takes about 60 minutes to charge. 6000 Mh battery in this segment is rare.
2. Camera is very good. Works well in all modes. Selfie camera is very good.
3. Fingerprint sensor is perfect and quick. Opens instantly.
4. There is no lag. I am a normal use and for me everything is quick.
5.Display is bright and sharp. Videos come out vivid.
6. Shape is attractive
It is a mid range phone having all the qualities of high end phone.
They should have given a better back cover and gorilla glass in it.

Looks and sounds great but doesn't go with it. Now what you really ask yourself is that for 18k with feature on paper does it really worth it.  I honestly feel you won't get a premium phone below 20k . My take on my 30s. Camera is good in sunlight it do give clear picture but in low light ni it that great. Phone looks very good in dual color mode. Perfomance of finger is not that fast I honestly feel my honor was great and quick in finger sensor.  Phone performance good better but not the quickest.  Battery life ..awesome though thg it take around 2 hours or more to change for 100 percent but then it last more than a day .  Night mode of phone is still bright and not good for eyes.  Overall I am happy with phone for the price I have paid  design specific are good and better for use . It's a budget phone .

Lovely phone by Samsung.
Im a die hard fan of some other company android phone and was hesitate to buy this one. But once i have it, i found it surprising well. Amoled touch is mesmerising, camera is awesome and the main thing battery life is just out of this world.
You need to charge the battery once, yes only once, and it lasts for the whole day. No need to chrge in office, car, etc. Believe  me it will go for the full day even if after using heavy apps, long concalls etc.

This Mobile is enough for need not for greed
Read my review
1.Battery key highlight it will give full 1 day of usage no matter how heavy you will use it.
2. Fast charging really awesome speed, it will charge the mobile really very fast. You won't be having any problem.
3. Samsung  Super Amoled display. This display is so bright and nice that no matter which brand except Samsung, which will beat it's clarity even IPhone display and this M30s display will be neck on neck.
4. Camera -Lots of people are not happy with camera may be because it's Samsung.
But it will give many feature especially
The 😊 Emoji  and the camera is enough to have good picture no complain about it.
Good for Need not for greed.
5. Finger print and Face ID fast.  It's that fast so you won't have any problem. There is nothing you will be getting  by saving or getting 1 sec more fast recognition.
6. Speaker the one of the loudest in Samsung its that much loud that you will have no problem in hearing the sound.
7.Body people say it's cheap but if you need glass body then this mobile is not for you. That is your excess need but the look you will be getting is cool.
8.Exynos chipset 9611 which is great and well optimised.  If you think that battery still needs more efficient then go to device care and select save battery from optimised mode then see its power efficiency which will give you 2 Days of 🔋 life.
No complain about device
And one note I have to give is that
If you play heavy game like Pubg that also in HD graphic than it is bound to get hot
So if you don't use the apps which make the device hot then it will be one of coolest
and cool device.
Thank you for reaching my review.😉

The product looks hideous and the colors do not do justice to the features.
Also, the 10 day replacement policy of amazon is the worst thing that can happen to it.
I wanted to replace the product for a different color since the saphire blue color is something no man can use. But the amazon people are not allowing a replacement.
I don’t get the fact that one can change a jeans if they don’t like the color but not a 15k worth mobile phone.

Very happy with my Samsung Galaxy M30s.
The phone's highlight is certainly its massive battery which lives upto its expectations and more. The Super Amoled display is gorgeous and is on par with most high end devices. The viewing angles are great and it provides an immersive experience.
The camera performance is great and its video quality definitely needs a special mention.
Gaming performance is good enough. I played Call of Duty Mobile with its default settings and it works fine.
Overall its a great budget oriented smartphone which would not dissappoint you.
Go for it!

this is a best phone from samsung, actually it has packed with high end performance, battery life and display quality..
display looks stunning, super amoled display done an great job... viewing angle is superb

performance wise it does a nice job while playing high end gameslike pubg it works well.. but in some places i found little bit laggy like during calls and sms from network.

fingerprint works fine but there is a small lag in it, may be in update they will rectify it.

camera is quite decent, especially wide angle lens works nice, live focus, slow motion is also very nice..

super steady mode works really well.. really amazed with this feature.

when talking about battery, only 6000mAh is for paper, but for practical scenario, it wont last more than 1 day for average use.. but battery back up is good overall.

Switching from a 3GB/16GB phone on RAM/ROM to M30S with 6GB/128GB is a great experience,  at least personally for me.
There are a few things that limit my "wow" feedback for this gadget is ( though it's hardly been a week ) is that the fingerprint reader isnt a bliss always. Even a bit of wetness, moisture or dampness makes it hard to operate which is annoying. During  a call the phone goes blank which I am not sure is a fault of proximity sensors or settings but the default settings should had taken care of it. Since the HOME button isn't a mechanical push button any more but is part of screen,  that makes it tougher to wake up the phone if the fingerprint sensor or phone isn't responding. For 17K I don't expect a miracle but Samsung built a lot of hype and wait for this phone so I was expecting miles ahead of performance and improved end user experience.
The phone isn't  a total disappointment though. The 6kMAH battery is a boon for long days when you forget to carry your charger &amp;/or power bank.
Camera quality could had been better for a 48MP but I am yet to test it on outdoors scenes and wildlife/nature clicks.
All in all I am happy with battery life but other aspects could had been a few notches above from current state.

The phone is perfect..considering the mid-range price!!
** Camera: There are lots of negativity regarding the camera. But let me tell you camera is good enough..not that bad some peoples are complaining. It's not perfect but really a good one. Both rear and front cameras perform well and take realistic photos. Live focus, slow &amp; super slow motion works well. My rating for camera is 8.5/10.
**Other things:
(+) Display: 10/10. Just wow. I guarantee
  you'll be amazed.
(+) Battery: 10/10. A real monster.
(+) Sound quality : Moderately high volume
  with amazing quality. 9/10
(+) No Heating: 9.5/10. Very minor to
  negligible heating even in heavy use.
(+) Processor: 10/10. No lagging at all.
(+) Screen Sharing: 10/10. Works well with my 43" LG Smart TV.
(+) User interface: 9.5/10. Super user friendly.
---------
(-) Fast Charging: Well, when a phone takes 2.5 hrs to get fully charged...one may not call its charger a fast one.  Not 15W, it had to be 25W at least. 5/10.
(-) Earphone: Should have been given!!. There should be no excuse like 'users have specific choices over headphones so we don't give it.' Sounds like a laughable excuse. 0/10.
(-) Tempered glass: This too..should have been given! 0/10.
(-) Dolby Atom : There is almost a little to no difference when you choose this option while earphone is being used.  4/10.
(-) USB Cable: Charging cum USB cable should be a bit longer. ..at least 1.5times the length it provides right now. 8/10.
***
I hope these will help you. HAPPY SHOPPING.

First of all, this phone is a monster. This 6000 mAh battery doesn't drain easily. I have been playing games on it like 6 hours per day and the drain is just 10%. I just love the backup and yes gone are the days wherein I had to carry a power bank.
Let me talk about the specific features of the phone.
Body: The phone has a steady build and gives a good grip to your hands. It WONT slip and fits perfectly in your hands. The camera, fingerprint ,volume keys are placed at the perfect positions . The speakers are well placed at the bottom with the charging slot and a headphone jack(Yes, they have a headphone jack)
2. Display: Samsung calls its Infinity U display and the screen covers around 91% of the phone area . The screen has got FHD resolution and the colors are vivid.
3. Camera: The phone features 3 camera and the back and one in the front for selfies. The camera clicks descent night mode pics and crystal clear daylight pics . The camera does still miss the depth and detailing but it does pretty good job for the price segment it's been targeted to. I have clicked many many pics in dark, daylight mode and feel that it stands at par with the phones in its category.
Processor: Samsung's in-house processor has done a great job in powering up the phone. I never felt that my phone is freezing or slowing down while I played games and did some CPU extensive tasks. Yes, a 6 GB RAM coupling also help here.
Storage: I have a 128GB variant and friends it's a personal choice. I might never go for an added memory card but yes they do have am extensible slot for upgrading the storage .
The best part is the Samsung UI. I am in love with that. They have a blue light filter and it really really helps alot. Blue light damages the eye if there is a constant exposure to it.
I never thought that this could also be a feature of a phone. I have been glued to the device but I don't feel that my eyes are burning . I would really like to thank Samsung for bringing up this in this device.
Dolby Digital: The enhances the sound quality and u can feel the beats clearly.
Samsung has also installed some great apps in the phone and they all keep you engaged.
I am really in love with this device. I seriously never thought that on such a price range,  the maker would give a great phone considering the fact that I used Nokia 6.1 plus and purchased it on the launch day itself.
Very satisfied with the phone. Camera can be improved with a software patch but overall a very great product pushed into the market at this price range and Samsung guarantee.

Don't buy... Don't buy...
Poor product  by Samsung.

Samsung  tried to satisfy  seller by cheating target buyers.

A lower spec product  available  in offline  is better than this exclusive online product.
Too much heating. Battery draining fast. Camera is blur. Network issues too. Registered return or replace. Prompting to check with blancco app. App gives result as good. It indicates working but not evaluates the actual quality.

Once again reiterating Don't purchase.

For this HONOR 20i is far better and cheaper too with 128GB

Finally returned for refund....

This one is pure winner in this range. Believe me. You would not find other phones matching this one.
1. Obviously it's 6000mAh battery.
2. Simple and clean Samsung's One UI.

4. It's weight is well distributed and is well balanced. (Considering monstrous batttery).
5. Digital Wellbeing integration does amazing job.
6. Exynos 9611 does good job to keep up with you.
7. Not much bloatwares, just one or two.
8. And the best part, It supports Widevine L1 so you can enjoy Netflix, Prime Videos in HD.

CONS
1. Camera output is not that crisp. But does good job.
2. Night time photos lack details.
3. Polycarbonate body is slippery.
4. Heats up while gaming for prolonged periods.

All in all it's very good phone if you like to use for jobs other than gaming.

Samsung Galaxy M30s
Gone are the days when the camera used to be the key highlight of a smartphone. Manufacturers are now bringing in phones with large batteries as the primary feature. Obviously, what's the use of a feature-heavy phone if there isn't enough juice in it to run the show for an entire day at least.
Samsung's Galaxy M30s is one such phone that offers a massive battery output on a single charge, along with a slew of other features in the budget segment.
The phone is a significant upgrade over Galaxy M30 with a segment-first 6,000 mAh battery supported by 15W fast charging, and an efficient processor that lifts the handset's overall performance.
The phone comes in 4GB RAM + 64GB and 6GB RAM + 128GB configurations, priced at Rs 13,999 and Rs 16,999, respectively.

The Galaxy M30s has a sleek profile and is easy to hold, despite its 6.4-inch screen. The screen is of the super AMOLED breed with a fullHD+ resolution. The phone has a glossy plastic panel on the back that has good resistance to unwanted fingerprints. The rear panel has a capacitive fingerprint sensor, which might not be the fastest in its segment but does the job of unlocking the phone without any hiccups. The phone weighs 188 grams, which is not heavy at all.
Camera
Samsung Galaxy M30s review: The phones USP lies in its massive battery

Imaging is one department where the Galaxy M30s gets most of its upgrades. The phone’s triple rear-camera module combines a 48MP primary camera, 8MP ultra-wide sensor, and a 5MP depth sensor. On the front, the phone has a 16MP selfie camera placed under the Infinity-U shaped notch on top of the screen. The camera has a dedicated night mode for low-light imaging. It can record 4K videos, Super Slo-Mo, Super Steady and Hyperlapse.
We had expected more from the camera after looking at the specifications but it does an average job when it comes to photography. Yes, the benefit of the doubt can be given here considering the price, but recent entries in the budget segment have raised hopes.
(Photo taken by Samsung Galaxy M30s)
We felt the images could have been sharper. The photos were fine in daylight conditions, the contrast and detailing are good. The night mode works fine but doesn't expect too much. The wide-angle photos are a bit grainy and lose clarity upon zooming in.
If you're a perfectionist, the camera may not impress you much, but the average user would like the overall output. The front camera takes fine selfies, though.
Performance

The Galaxy M30s is powered by the Exynos 9611 system-on-chip (SoC). It boots Android 9 Pie operating system-based One UI, which is a huge improvement over the Experience 9.5 UI that powered its predecessor. The phone’s user interface is clutter-free. The big app icons and easy-to-navigate UI make the phone easy to use.
The phone’s performance seems satisfactory on gaming. It would not be fair to expect too much but we had a decent time playing PUBG, Asphalt9 and Super Cricket.
The battery goes on and on. You can binge-watch any web series, use the camera, play games, and it would still last to sail through the next day. The 6,000 mAh battery does not drain that easily and the 15W fast charging is good enough to make the phone ready to use in just over an hour.
(Photo taken using ultra-wide lens in Samsung Galaxy M30s)
The Galaxy M30s is an ideal phone if you want a device that can handle excruciating hours of streaming, gaming and camera use, apart from the usual social media use. The battery is impressive and allows you to make full use of the features. The overall performance is fine, the camera be all that exciting.

I've been using the Samsung Galaxy M30s (6GB / 128GB) for more than a month now and I've found the product to be really good in terms of functionality, battery life and camera. I am pretty satisfied with the purchase. However, I still desire more from Samsung with regards to the OS. The OS feels outdated in some contexts for e.g., dialer app / calling app is not very user friendly. Also, the fingerprint reader needs to be more sensitive as many times it is unable to recognize the user and one has to manually unlock the device. The camera quality is pretty decent although I may not be the best judge as I'm not much into photography, however, the wide mode is very impressive and is able to capture big spaces/structures very easily. On the hardware front, it would have been better if Samsung had provided a lengthier charging cable and earphones along with the product. Overall,  I would recommend the phone to my review readers for sure (at least to those who are okay with the few shortcomings)

Hats off to Samsung on making such a good smartphone (Can't say it's best honestly taking camera into consideration)... Especially in this price range.
1. Firstly display is truly incredible which gives this smartphone a flagship feel. It's a super Amoled panel after all so thumps up for that.
2.Next is perfomance which is also nice considering the price. Everyone knows that in past Samsung never showed any efforts on there processors in mid range which is crucial.
But this smartphone tackles that con and brings a processor (Exynos 9611) that is on par with other competitor in this price segment which is truly amazing.
3. UI experience is another part in which Samsung has taken a great leap. New One UI is truly fantastic as compared to Samsung experience which was too much buggy...
This custom UI is somewhat like a stock android but retains many advanced functions of Samsung experience. It also brings new functions like system wide dark mode (Which is yet to be released in android 10 update but this UI has it which is freaking cool).
Also this smartphone has Always on display which i personally like and which was only available on Samsung flagships so 5+ rating for that..
4. The biggest concern every smartphone user has is battery whether he/she is heavy user or moderate user. Well this smartphone gives a great relief and pleasure while considering battery. It has "6000 MAH" battery and when we take such heavy numbers in reviews,  it's honor to mention it.
This smartphone literally kills every other smartphone in competition and above (,i.e., flagship phones) while considering battery.
Truly speechless, relieved and excited. Nothing more to say about it.  It's just monstrous.
5. Generally I'm not concerned about camera but I'll review about it. It has tonnes of features including super steady and super slow motions. All features works perfectly fine for me. Camera is decent i say. But not on par with other competitors in same price range. It has 48mp primary cam,  13mp ultra wide and 8mp depth sensor in rear and 16mp front cam. Samsung had used its own isocell sensor in primary 48mp camera instead of Sony imx586's 48mp camera which other smartphones  use. Sony sensor has better dynamic range compared to Samsung.
Ultra wide camera is awesome, works like a charm, super steady and super slo mo also works greatly but only in natural lighting conditions. But primary 48mp camera is not so great. Details are missing while zooming.
Hope this will get fixed in future updates. Overall i rate camera 4 out of 5 due to its feature rich camera.
So to sum up this review i say Samsung has nailed it with this device. I'm happy with my purchase. If camera gets improvement in near future then this smartphone would even get 5 star from me. Again congrats to Samsung to create a beast like this...

3.Battery life is approximately 2 days.
4.Blue tint gives stylish look to the handset.
5.Samsung has incorporated many new unique feature's in its OS which i couldn't find in any other phone's. Eg Popup view feature , providing scoll feature near finger print sensor etc....
Thanks amazon and samsung for giving this lovely deal during Diwali.

Hi all,

I usually don't write reviews.  However,  I thought I should write one for this phone. I hope most of us who are facing issues with this phone will benefit out of this! Let's get started with the pros first!

Pros:
Camera: it's a brilliant camera and night mode is pretty cool. It is important to note that the default camera is not the 48MP. U need to select it from the options to be able to use it.  I would,  though agree that it doesn't give a 48MP output but it is still decent and better than many phone cameras.

Touch and feel: the phone fits well in the hands if u have decently large hands. I am able to use it one handed. There touch is feather smooth too. Opening and closing or switching between apps is easy.

Battery: A massive 6000 mah battery. People talk about fast charging. If 3000mah battery gets charged in 45 to 60mins and that's fast charging,  then 6000mah getting fully charged in 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours can't be termed slow charging.  Do not go by percentage of charge. Because 1% of 6000 is double 1% of 3000.

Wifi: the phone had issues with wifi reception at the beginning but then got better after a few restarts.

Memory: it's got a separate slot for external memory.  This helps in using the same phone for two numbers and for storage as well.  I have a 64GB version.  I have all my apps on phone memory and every thing else on my external card.

Dual app: this phone also supports dual apps. U can have two WhatsApp, two smule accounts ( if u r a singer😛), two FB accounts and so on! So, all on in all,  just one phone is enough.  Carrying two phones is not necessary!

The phone doesn't heat even on continuous usage for 2 to 3 hours. I play games,  browse flipkart, make calls, WhatsApp,  and still I did not find any heating issues.  It might get a little warm but that's very negligible!

Cons:

Network reception: I had this problem when I bought the phone.  Was highly irritated as I had to restart my phone every half an hour to be able to receive and and make calls or SMS. However,  I did a little research on it and found that switching the phone off, inserting the sim and then restarting it resolves the issue. Inserting the SIM into the phone while it is on seems to create the issue. Please switch the phone off and then insert both SIM.

I hope this helps everyone!

Edit: adding a few night shots! Just to show the camera ability!

Pros:
1. Incredible battery life (as expected as it boasts of 6000mAh battery). It runs for almost 2 days with basic features running.
2. Very beautiful design &amp; finish.
3. Quick boot and updates are made available.
4. I just setup the fingerprint with only one swipe and that's it. I never looked back.
5. Images from the camera are beautiful and has high contrast with good vibrance.
6. No lag in application.
7. Value for money.

Cons:
1. Swipe keyboard is not intelligent.
2. Some pictures have less details (since it is random I'm not sure what setting,  if at all any, would rectify this issue)

Backstory:
I have been a flagship user for a long time and recently when my phone stopped working I had to start looking for a new phone. I chanced upon the launch of Samsung  M30s on Amazon and was blown away by the features and the pricepoint. Without second guessing I ordered the 128GB/6GB variant in nebula blue. Delivery as always was on  point from Amazon and I had the phone in my hand within 8 hours of ordering.

Unboxing:
The phone comes in a small box just slightly bigger than the size of the phone. It contains the handset, a data cable, a travel adapter, an ejection pin and the owner's manual. The box says 'Make for India' and mentions that the device is MANUFACTURED IN INDIA which gives me more satisfaction compared to buying Chinese phones. Another interesting thing the box mentions is the fact that printing on the box is done with soy ink which doesn't have any harmful chemical affect( another good choice by Samsung).

The first time you pick up the phone in your hands it gives a premium touch and feel specially the amoled screen. Although the phone is a bit thick as compared to others it's still light and easy to hold.

Smooth Transitioning from Old Phone:
The phone is fast in booting up and also the set up is easy and functional and would be especially easy if you're switching from a Samsung device.

Apps already loaded:
The phones comes with a host of apps already loaded on the phone. Most of these can be uninstalled to make way for others.

Pros:
1) Speed: The phone is fast as well as smooth in Transitioning between apps and even with a number of apps open it doesn't slow down.

2) BEAST BATTERY: I can't mention this enough but the battery is amazing and with normal usage lasts Upto 3 days.

3) Camera: The 48 mp triple rear camera is good for taking shots. The camera app provide has a host of features that help you take the best shots. I found the low light photos and wide angle shots to be really good. The smaller front shooter is also value for money though I didn't like the fact that it beautifies your face in every selfie but that can be changed in the settings.

4) sAMOLED: The 6.4 inch sAMOLED is really good and makes the phone the powerhouse that it is.

5) Fingerprint Sensor: The fingerprint sensor at the back of the phone is really fast and takes just to microseconds to respond. Its overall much better than the one on my One Plus 5.

6) Blue Light Filter: The blue light Filter which can be activated from the top down menu is really helpful and makes screen feel much softer to your eyes. I have been using the blue light Filter continuously since I received the phone.

7) Gaming: Games even with heavy graphics run smoothly and with gaming mode you can control your total experience.

8) Dolby Atmos: You can use Dolby Atmos whenever you connect your phone to an earphone and it really enhances your experience. I used it with my JBL earphones and it somehow made everything on my playlist sound better.

9) Speakers: The speakers on the phone are loud and clear. If you're getting a call on the phone , believe me, you'll know you're getting a call.

Cons:
1) Charging: Although there is what Samsung calls Adaptive Fast Charging in the phone but considering it's a 6000 mah device it still takes around 3.5 hours to take the phone to full charge which I guess could have been faster.

Final Assesment:
If you're looking for a total value for money device that gives you a solid performance with a huge battery, great display and also great camera performance look no further than this. With this one solid phone Samsung has taken on a host of Chinese devices in this price point and come out on top with battery still left.

I am totally satisfied with my decision to purchase this smartphone. I think Samsung has been aware of its product line that matches all expectations of its vast users in the world. Coming to Samsung M30s smartphone I will say that it packs a punch so effective and productive that everybody will love to buy this smartphone which is strategically priced under the Rs.15,000/- segment at an entry level. The Crystal clear Screen, the android software which is highly customised, the dolby atmos sound feature, the strong 48mp camera lens, the cool and long lasting 6000 mah battery with a fast and snappy 15watt charger are just some incredible features of this Samsung smartphone.
I am sure that other smartphone companies will understand that Samsung will stay a market leader as it not only innovates but also gives more intrinsic value &amp; a great user experience.
Once again guys this phone Samsung M30s rocks and is a strong contender to be called THE SMARTPHONE OF THE YEAR.

Short review - It's a buy if you need very good screen and battery backup without any doubt won't let you down at any normal usage front.

Description -
1) Screen ... AMOLED with night mode ... Which is very vibrant colors and black.
2) Battery - 6000mAh without say biggest ever ... Except rog gaming phone.
3) Backup - battery maybe one thing but if your software isn't smooths and have lot of background unnecessary services it eat the juice... But this one is not one of them... Easily 2 day back up .. at end of second day it was 30% at around 12 midnight.. with 2 sim both 4g.
4) Processor - if you are video watcher and regular phone user it's most efficient 10nm exynos 9611 ... reason for long back up and smooth with multitasking and graphic and camera usage.
5) Gaming - regular games very smooth experience... Heavy graphics no try something else.
6) Camera - Broad daylight ... Awesome very good hdr and wide angle shot. Live view Samsung version of portraits mode works ok. Dark or low light .. grainy.
7) Packaging shipping was perfect and fast .. thanks to Amazon ... Within a day
8) Music - Dollby can be kicked on when connected to headphone  or speaker via 3.5mm Jack or Bluetooth.. audible difference can be noticed.
Also inbuil speakers are loud ..  but not that Melody.
9) Earpiece and connectivity works perfectly so far .. no issue till date.
10) Fingerprint scanner - back mount.. can be said as drawback but then since it's back mount Samsung added function to pull down notification panel right by swiping on it... That's cool. Works smoth and fast.

It is the first Samsung handset that I have bought. And it is just wow!!!
First, the delivery was quick.

Go for this handset in this price range. This handset is going to be Realme and Redme killer. You can't ask for more
at this price.

SPEAKERS 10/10
CAMERA
  FRONT 6/10
  BACK 8.5/10
PERFORMANCE  9/10
BATTERY 10/10 (Awesome  monster battery)

The battery of the phone is just amazing it reduces only 8-10% after use of heavy use ( Play songs on loud volume, pics clicking, gaming (clash of clans, PUBG) etc in 2 hours

Its takes around 1 hr to charge about 40-45% with its fast charger around 2 hrs it gets charge from 0 -90%

Camera is just amazing
But front camera is not upto the mark
It takes good pics but slighty softly image (personaly i don't  like)

But the back camera is just amazing
There are many modes in back camera
Like
Slow motion video
Super slow video (my favourite)
Night Mode
Pro mode
Food mode
Ar emojies
4k recording
Super steady mode (best)
And etc

The performance of the phone is amazing doesn't  lag any like others Samsungs phone i like it

The UI of the phone is fully customized  hence it has tons of good features which i like the most

The sound quality of this phone is just amazing
The sound is loud and it doest tear any more
And the output of the earphone from this phone is just truely amazing because it has inbuilt DOLBY ATMOS which give acceleration  to its sound
If u are a music lover then go for it

The display was awesome it has SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY( i like the most)

Cons
It doesn't  have any notifications  light but it has a Always on display feature

The phone doesn't  come with any earphone and back cover ehich i thought due its budget price it doesn't have but no worry we are desi users we buy from local market🤣🤣

I buy this phone in just 11599
As the phone is of 13999 and i purchased  it from SBI card and i got 1400 rupees off +1000 cashback in my amazon account hence i got it in 11599

At last my Tip is in this price no compsny will give u these types of features

JUST GO FOR IT

I am writing my genuine review  after using a week..

Battery: the valid thing in the phone is 6000mah battery .. its last more that 48hrs of moderate usage and 3days for minimal usage .. I request samsung have to optimize  few steps to improve and charging speed of the battery.. it take 2.30 min to full.. I have to wait till a movie ends (lol)..but not a issue...

Display: samsung done great job in the display amoled .. punchy colors and clarity.. it's too good...

Build: for making a budget mid ranger from a reputed brand .. plastic build is acceptable... it get scratches so better use protection...

Camera:  I expected this camera has equivalent to realme xt or vivo x pro.. but samsung made us very disappointment with the camera.. this tri camera makes device look but camera have to improve much much ... low light its performing some times decent.. normal pictures are looks like very low pixelated... like an 5mp cam.. this may be fix from software updates.. expecting better update... else this phone can't beat its competitors.. with just 6000 battery.. against their in display fp  and camera competitions..

Good luck samsung..
Over all a budget phone .. my suggestion  is do you want good display and battery and useful one ui features with samsung brand just go for.  It else just wait for till a update to recover their camera clarity ...

Camera-Its one of the best camera I have ever seen specially its wide angle is excellent and camera clarity is the best.
Finger Print reader- It miss out sometimes when your hands are bit wet so make sure to make your hands dry before you scan it.
Battery life- its excellent it gives me a two days of battery life with excessive usage .

I come from a stock Android experience, so at first I was a little confused with One UI. But once I got used to it, I realized that a phone is not just its hardware.
The processor is powerful enough, I could do all tasks including gaming with ease, never felt a stutter. Also because of the perfectly optimized software.
The battery doesn't need a second word. It's just superb. But it takes so much time to charge. (Obviously)
The sAMOLED screen is just so amazing. I think it'll be hard for me to move from Samsung. OneUI is arguably one of the best Androids I've seen. That coming from a stock Android guy, there's hardly any bloatware, unlike other Chinese phones. So that's appreciable.
Just close your eyes and buy it, and you'll not regret it for sure.

Performance &amp; network capturing capacity needs improvement.
Rest features are same like other mobiles not much gr8
( First received the used mobile then replaced by Amazon with newer one.
Though it was mentioned less amount of EMI by Amazon they have charged more amount ( 1500 Rs more than the mentioned one ) on raising a concern for the same Amazon authorities raised their hands saying it none of our concerns go and talk to bank &amp; Bank is saying the same go to Amazon.
Amazon employees neither supported nor shown any intention to solve the same.
Ultimately a customer has to pay 1500 more than the specified rates ( Case is of No Cost EMI ) .
As they have charged 1500 extra could se o cash back &amp; it became Cost EMI
Not Expected this from Amazon for his Prime Member customers.

I bought the phone on Amazon and been using my Samsung M30s for couple of weeks now.
Delivery experience from Amazon - top notch.

The best thing about the phone is its battery life. With normal usage, the battery works for days. With lots of gaming and app usage, it still easily works for 2 days. With 6000 mAH battery life is no problem at all.

The 6.4" super AMOLED display is awesome. The camera notch at top is minimum. Gives a very immersive experience while gaming or watching videos.

With 8 core CPU, performance of gaming and other heavy apps is extremely good.

The back camera is 48MP triple rear camera. What that means is you can snap photos normally and ultra-wide shots. The night mode is also good. Front camera is also good. No auto-focus for front camera. Optical image stabilisation is missing for both cameras. All in all, the camera is great in the price range.
The pricing of the phone makes it a great buy.

The build quality is similar to other Samsung phones. Very light weight and sleek phone.

Only disadvantage I found is the speakers of this phone. No stereo support and the only speaker at the bottom is very low in volume.

Verdict - With the given price range, the battery life, great camera and amazing display makes this phone a great buy !!

Samsung is one of the trusted phone brand in Indian market since 2003 when I saw for the first time a black and white with blue backlight.
Competiting with most of the flag ship under price range of Rs. 17000,nothing can get better than M30s
The phone offers variety of functions and specifications.
The most awesome features  about the phone  are
1.obviously  the battery life.  The phone can go for 2 days with moderate use and 18 hours of rigorous  use.
2. The touch response  is great, and the there  is a coating on the glass which make the feel premium
3. The phone is ultra light
4. Improved connectivity of wifi
5. Greater bandwidth which can provide network in areas of low coverage like a closed room
6. Screen share with smart T.V
7. Dolby atmos surround sound once you connect it to a bluetooth  or home theater device
8. Ultra slow motion is just amazing
9. Provide a digital  stabilisation while recording

The cons are
1. Camera sensor could have been better but can't complain for the price which we have paid its exceptionally okay
2. No earphones rather people use earpods of a earpiece  of there choice

Received  defective  product.  I applied  for replacement but new mobile also got defective.  I also reached to service center of Amazon but no satisfactory  solution  found.

Don't  recommend  to buy from Amazon  as service  is so poor.

Problems found  in mobile:
1. Mobile body is not properly fit
2. Fingerprint lock is not proper

I have trust on Amazon service that's  why purchased from here but result is very disappointed.

There is a manufacturing defect in this model. Below the Volume and Power button and below the Sim/Hybrid SD Card tray you will be able to press from the sides as if there is air gap, it keeps on bothering me all time. Later I lodged for replacement, the complaint was lodged and the visit was scheduled but the person who was going to come to inspect my phone did not show up. Few of my friends brought the same model and this same problem persist, I would suggest new buyers to take a look at this issue as soon as you receive this model. Later I had to go to service center, there the removed the back cover and put it again but this solution did not work completely well, the sides of Power button was resolved (no air gap) but increased the defect below the Sim tray. The Samsung customer care said that this will not create any issue in future to any part of device. I want a replacement if there is any problem in future, as of now functionality wise the device is working fine............no heating while using maps or while charging, camera quality is good, fingerprint quick unlock, excellent battery life and good processing speed.

Great option in mid-range segment, especially if you are planning to use your phone for as many years as possible as its the battery that wears out with limited charge cycles of Li-Po technology. Nothing to complain about till now. Ensure to watch GeekyRanjit's review to know how to opt out of Samsung's ads while setting up the phone on first boot. A lot of the pre-installed apps can be uninstalled from the Galaxy Store as well. This is my first Samsung phone and first smartphone without near-stock Android but happy with the experience (I use Nova Launcher). Surprised at how much Samsung has improved over the years in reducing bloatware - I've seen their awesome hardware become unusable for people without custom ROMs; but now its different.

I'm happy with the product .I will state all the pros and cons:
Pros:
1. Mega battery life
2. Great camera
3. Nice display super AMOLED
4. Basic functions of whatsapp, various apps and internet surfing is a breeze and I don't even have to worry about memory (ram) or battery power at all ! I also heard u can play PubG for a long time thanks to the amazing battery life
Cons:
Cons are compared to iphone6s which I was using previously but there are hardly any . Some which are there to a minor extent I will mention :
1. Retina display of iPhone 6s although small but appears sharp because of the pixel combining property of this phone's display , same issue with camera pics.
2. Very slight ( almost insignificant ) lag typical of android phones compared with iPhones.  U might not notice if you have a previous android phone . Coz this phone also has a good processing speed
. Overall , extremely happy with the purchase.

I bought this phone 3 days ago. Following are the observations:
1. Bit heavier. Easily perceivable
2. Face recognition does not work
3. Screen is not tempered
4. No earphones in the bundle
5. The 3.5mm Jack is positioned on the bottom side and hence for wired headset, this may pose an issue
Now, the awesomeness:
1. What a display!!! Man....I just fell in love with it
2. The user interface. One UI is literally the best
3. Lock and volume rockers are positioned on the same side and they operate extremely good
4. Fingerprint sensor works in a slick manner
5. Am not a fan of the mobile camera and so, the camera fulfills its basic requirement to me
6. The charger automatically switches on power mode while the battery is low and vice versa
7. Massive 6000 mAH
Overall, the phone has a good design that do not offend anyone, a massive power back up, good camera and a lovely display made me satisfied customer.
Kudos to Amazon, as it failed its promise of delivering in 3 days, but delivered me in a surprisingly 1 day!

INITIAL IMPRESSIONS
1)FHD+ sAMOLED screen steals your attention right away
2) Love the green and black colour though it's a subjective thing
3)One UI feels butter smooth
4)Not a gaming centric phone,And I was not planning for one but still handles games like PUBG pretty neat.
5)Yet to test out the camera though it looked above average initially. (Will update this review once I do)
6)Battery backup is beastly as expected so far.
7)Supports HD content on streaming platforms right away.
Cons:
1)No simple case provided in the box to use the phone restlessly right away,Not necessarily a con but still.
So far So Good. Will update review time to time.

Samsung Galaxy m30s is a very nice product. I m writing this after using for more than a week. Opal black handset looks classy. Feel of the phone is awesome, easy to navigate with one hand. Weight balance is perfect even though it has 6000 mah battery. Super amoled display is great. it shows black as black. Best is the battery backup. I am an average user, battery lasts for 3 days. This is a main USP of m30s. Camera is decent, colours are very much natural, video s perfect. All this in 14000 is a major plus. No heating issues. Full battery charging takes 2.5 hours, but it's because of 6000 mah battery. The only con, I thought with this product is that when we apply a bit of pressure on right side edge, we get the feeling that the edge is not perfectly fitted. It's probably some kind of flaw at production level or quality control. This may not be with all handsets. But this is an area of improvement for this product. Still  I would say it's worth buying m30s.

Everything is fine... I got it today 6GB ram on the price 14999/- battery is super duper bawal .. camera is okay not best but it's very smooth to operate and damn sure that I will enjoy it for next 5 years...but the only problem is that phone unlocks even when my eyes are closed. Face lock should be upgraded. When I am asleep anybody can open my mob just by showing my face. I request samsung to improve it in next update

Only battery is good. Rest all is ok. Samsung should improve in all aspects. Not getting proper security update. No android 10 UI 2.0 update recd after 7 months.  Value is high. Processor is very  slow.  Need improvement in there system one  UI. Image editor is very poor. Also heavy phone. With call quality is good.

Samsung Galaxy M30s has a good display, and watching content on it was a pleasant experience. It gets bright enough outdoors and I did not have issues with sunlight legibility. The Exynos 9611 powering the smartphone is capable of delivering a smooth experience without any hiccups. I could navigate through the menus and launch apps without any stutters. The fingerprint scanner is also quick to unlock the smartphone and did not require multiple attempts. There is face recognition as well, and the smartphone is quick to unlock after a successful scan.
Battery life is the highlight of the Galaxy M30s and the 6,000mAh battery does help this smartphone soldier on for a very long time before it needs to be plugged in. I could go on for 1.5 days with my usage involving an active WhatsApp account, taking camera samples, and playing about 40 minutes of YouTube.When the battery does run out, the supplied 15W charger is capable of charging the phone to 22 percent in 30 minutes, and up to 43 percent in an hour. Charging the phone completely takes about two and a half hours.
Pros:-
•Crisp AMOLED display
•Great battery life
•Decent performance
•Good camera performance in daylight
Cons:
•Camera is slow to focus
•Spammy notifications
Review after 3 days of usage🙂

● If you are seeing the reviews of Samsung Galaxy M30s for buying the best mobile in good place , then,  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SMARTPHONE!

• CAMERA . The 48MP + 8MP + 5MP CAMERA of this phone takes ULTIMATE and SUPERB photos. (See the first picture)

• GRAPHICS AND PROCESSOR.  This phone's graphic quality is like a PRO. Games does not lags, hangs or gets disconnected. Thus, you can say it's VERY SPEEDY.

• BATTERY. The battery of this phone LASTS VERY LONG as it is 6000 mAH SUPER battery.

• SYSTEM. This is a very important part of a phone. This phone provides the LATEST  version of Android which is 9.0 (pie). All the functions in the phone are the BEST. As the seller is SAMSUNG, from you can say it is the best quality product in market, i.e. better than other top selling brands of mobiles like :- Mi( originally 'Xiami' pronunced ) ,Vivo, etc. And even in very less price as compared to product in reality.

Pros: long battery life, high clarity display,advanced features for ease of usage, very good back camera

Cons: selfies lack clarity and colour definition when compared to higher Samsung models, heavier and larger size makes one hand operation not easy, need a cover with grip without which phone is smooth and slippery increasing danger of falling down.

I felt premium by using this device,samsung has provided it's best through m30s in such a less price...look wise it's pretty good and really safe to use the device..that's the best thing why I swithed to samsung from mi a1...SAR value is some what resembling to 0.468 w/kg and my previous  device had 1.75 w/kg which crossing the limit of SAR value limit of India and is some what banned in India...Yes guys SAR value matters,the radition can inbalance your hormonal activities and is very hard to find..So I appreciate  Samsung regarding the safety they provide through smartphones.The phone actually got somewhat 8 days to reach me.So I think the service from the Amazon side must improve,may some transist issues,but the packaging was good..thank you

One of the best smart phones available today. Its a steal for the conservative price this phone demands. Whatever may be the features in a phone, ultimately the most used things in any phone in its lifetime would be its Display, Battery, RAM and ROM. Samsung won the race by smartly bundling all these into the sleek and smart M30S. Addition to all these, it also offers 48MP triple camera, capable enough to capture pictures like a pro. A bigger relief with this phone is...... once charged, it easily manages to run for 2 days with normal usage. Whatelse would anyone looking for a smartphone wants!

By Launching M30s Samsung has changed market dynamics once again...M30s is truely a monster at reasonable price. 6 GB ram n Exynos 9611 processor coupled with 6000 mAh battery makes a great combination of speed n long usage time and sAMOLED display give crystal clear n sharp output. For normal usage no need to charge battery for almost 3 days.
Camera is good with multiple options ranging from wide angle, super slow mode, hyperlapse to pro modes.
Being a samsung fan, M30s launch cant be timed better for me as I was thinking of changing my current A5 but didn't want to change the brand to vivo or oppo or MI.
In nutshell, M30s is a powerhouse in affordable price range.

The camera quality could be improved becoz of the default camera setting which are putin by samsung  shows way too much grains n particles in your photos  I do not know whether the ISO or saturation or hue could be altered  but ut stands no where on comparison to Nokia 8.1 camera " superb " considering the price range and for quick camera shots when u do not have a proper camera with you the one that shoots sharper n clear images say of a running bike numberplate...is the winner....

just 2 days using this phone
display --&gt; fab amoled wins anyday

Battery life --&gt; very nice considering the dusplay oitput on amoled...  will just put smile on ur face

UI--&gt; u will love it if u r using stock android for long time  already using Nokia 6.1 plus.

Gameplay--&gt;8/10  :)

BUILD quality --&gt;my nokia fell face down quadruple times on thr ground still no issues with the fone running smooth.  But saw no covers can can protect your samsung screen

As I never used samsung before but after using this one
Considering it is a budget phone under 20k

OVERALL if samsung could provide screen size lije d samsung s10e that would be perfect to grab in hands and operate and ofcourse in this budget

M30s is actually a phone worth its price and it stand with the premium phones. After some weeks use what i like of this is
1. Its battery is superb
2. Display is great
3. Sound is perfect
4. Fingerprint reader is fast enough
5. Face unlock is superfast and real quick
6. Design is also very attractive
And now what i dont like is
1. Camara is really cheap and it does not
  come as they say
2. Expandable memory card is not supporting
  in the phone ( i dnt understand the reason
  its not problem with the card )
3. The brigthness of the screen is not very
  bright under direct sunlight ( its very low )

But overall the phone is amazing and worth the every penny you spend

1. Camera disappointed me alot. back camera 48 MP but in real it's 13 MP. Day light picture average but low light or in room it gives poor pictures quality. Front camera 16 MP but actually it's 8 MP. It is below average. Rest all feature are there like slow motion, super slow motion, image filter, blur effect, you can even change background of images after click picture means increase  density  of blurriness.
2. Second big disatvange charging. It take more than 3hrs to complete charge. If Samsung  giving  us 6000mah battery  than fast charging  must be there and 6000 mah is like 5000mah.
3. About Looks Back is made up of cheap plastic I have saw many YouTube videos there  it looks shiny and glossy but in real it is simple plastic  panel not feel it's premium and easy get scratched .so back cover is compulsory.
4. From front side it looks  premium. phone display is awesome. But no gorilla glass protection so you must buy good quality screengaurd.
5. Fingerprint, face lock, sound quality, radio, calling experience, network, performance all are good like Samsung  phones.

No earphones, tempred glass and back case in box. You have to buy it yourself. At last you can buy this phone if you are not selfy  lover. You can say its average  phone and Samsung  ka barosa.

Wow...phone...I impressed a lot, I review this after 2 months of usage...
Goods:
Worth to buy.
Battery life too good for me it's enough for 2days. Awesome camera front and back sides.
Even pictures are too good in low light also. For slow motion video works good in day light or bright fire light at night.. fingerprint reader in back sideb is very use full to unlock phone...
receiving proper updates.. all other features are good like as usual Samsung galaxy.
Bads:
More theams not available
App icons not appear it's original shape
Shortcut ball not available, feeling difficult to take screenshots.

My m30s is real monster because I can stream hd content from netflix and amazon prime videos on m30s with 6000 mah battery which is comes with 15w fast type c charging and app management is like montser on samsung OneUI. So i can say 6000 mah battery on OneUi is like 10000 mah..
Camera is monster pro beause it has scene optimiser and shot suggestions. Super slow motion is flagship feature in this price..
Performance-  I'm playing pubg in high graphics smoothly on this device that means power pack phone. Exynos 9611 means 10 nm, no heat, app optimization with OneUI, long term same performance.

Back Fingerprint scanner is faster than indisplay fingerprint and back finger scanner on samsung comes with extra gestures feature.

OneUI On Samsung M30S
Extra feature
One handed Control Phone
Expand screenshot
Night mode and Blue light blocker
Digital wellbeing tracker
Next generation game launcher
Smart popup view
Dual messenger that means u can use two messenger in a phone. No need to install third party app..
Please see all attached pictures- Camera samples and OneUI Snaps
 I can't describe everything about this phone.
So buy it and discover by yourself
Thank you Samsung

I purchased this on 3rd jan, its been 10 days now and it seems awesome.
Pros:
(BEST) - Battery life, i recharge after 2.5 days, with full usage like whatsapp, chrome, soundcloud, calls, etc.
Camera has been improved, near range focus is really good.
Powerful performance and yes with sAMOLED everything looks much more better.

Cons:
Just one, since i used huawei smartphone earlier (P20 lite), the UI of huawei was much more better than samsung.

Overall under 20k budget its the best smartphone is market and yes innovation wise samsung is always ahead.

Its a awesome  mobile, actually when try to take pic my selfie then pic came to not good then i disappeared  but after some settings it gives mind blowing pic.
Features
1. Its screen is good.
2. Its battery backup is also so good,i m using after purchase  from two days after full  charge and backup is still 21% . I didn't  use too hard.
3. Well samsung given  us 6GB ram but actually we use  less then 3 GB due to its internal app uses.
4. Hard disk vacant 110GB left after its internal apps.

Many features  are but i can explain now bcoz i need time.
But after review  my mobile my staff ordered other samsung M30s mobile for himself.

So I ordered this phone for my sister as a Present and gave it to her. As soon as she transferred the data, put the SIM and restarted, the display went off. Phone was on but completely blacked out display. All these within a few hours of unboxing. When she took it to the nearest Samsung Service Centre, they said the display has to be changed. Since it is under warranty, they are willing to do it for free.  But Why? Samsung should have done the quality check? Why shall I accept a completely new product whose display doesn't work within few hours of unboxing it.

My Mistake:
1. I trusted amazon and Samsung product and didn't open it until it was too late for a replacement / refund

Amazon India: I didn't accept this from your end. Never ever I am buying a Samsung product

Delivered with 48 hours.
One of the main reason to purchase this phone is Super AMOLED display which looks pretty good.
Performance:As it comes with 2.3GHz,1.7GHz Octa core Processor (Samsung Exynos 9611) with 6GB RAM it is good as i played pubg for 2hours continuously in HD ultra mode without any framedrops.
Battery:As it comes with 6000Mah battery it does feel to heavy to  carry phone it is light weight  and i am shocked with the design as well as the performance of battery.
Fingerprint reader:With this i could easily unlock my phone faster compared to my previous motorola phone.
Camera:As it come with 48MP+5MP+8MP( Ultra wide) triple camera we get colorful pictures. Another great thing about camera is it as inbuilt superslowmotion and slow motion recording.

Camera quality very bad as compared to MI. After zoom out the image get break the pixel quality. I was ask to Amazon for return this mobile and want to other but as per policy return not applicable in policy. I lost my MI with exchange offer 😡

Good. I have return earlier received mobile but still same problem but actually main reason is samsung camera quality is very bad.

The battery life being the usp of this phone doesn't disappoint. On an average 2 days of battery backup is what I can get easily  upon moderate usage.
The camera however lacks substantially keeping in mind its 48mp. The photos lack saturation and contrast.
Fingerprint reader however is decent but since i switched from 1+ i felt its a bit slow.

Keeping in mind the price, i will surely recomend this phone if battery is your priority.  Skip this if camera is your priority.

Battery life is fantastic. And a fast charger to juice it up is a cherry on the cake. Samsung's One UI is smooth and fluid. No issues faced so far. Fingerprint reader often gets smudged and when trying to unlock, says "Fingerprint scanner might be dirty".  Display is awesome compared to other Realme/Redmi phones in this proce range. Wish Samsung provided faster security updates. Other phones in this proce range have Sep 2019 security patch while this phone is stuck on Aug 2019. Doubts linger over Android 10 update.

Starting with 80% battery life, leaves 30% by the end of the day. Performance is really good as compared to my previous phone with snapdragon 625. Display quality is really good. Fingerprint sensor is fast to unlock, but it doesn't lock again the unlocked phone.
Camera is really good. Overall this phone is a serious upgrade if you're looking for

If you had Mary with your smart phone, use phone 6-7 hrs a day, true wanderer &amp; frequent tourer, capture each and every moment of your life without getting drain off battery. Then no one can do all this 4 u, other then M30s

M30s is 2nd generation phone of M30 series.

No doubt this chap is far better and upgraded by many features like. 48 MP tri lense, 6000 Mah battery, Super AMOLED display, &amp; many more.

Display: Super AMOLED display is killer. 5*️⃣
Looks &amp; Asthetics: Need improvement.  2 *️⃣
Battery : Loaded with Monster battery  4.5*️⃣
Process &amp; Performance : Nice 3.5 *️⃣
Camera: Back 4*️⃣,  Front 3*️⃣
Ergonomics &amp; User friendly: Need improvement 3*️⃣

Pros:
1. Competitive price.
2. Overall build quality.
3. Service Assistance &amp; trust of Samsung.

Cons:
1. Some glitches with Slow motion &amp; super slow motion videos that you cannot expect from Samsung. But this may get fix by new software update patch if Samsung wants.
2. Asthetics could have been much better than conventional Samsung curvy look &amp; feel.
3. Colors are very usual and doesn't gives you any wow effect.

Kudos to Amazon committed delivery. Received one day before which is really great.

Pros:
1. Awesome Battery life easily last for 2-3days for normal user (who doesn't play games) which I really not had expectation.
2. AMOLED screen is awesome when you watch any video in mobile yes you feel happy to see it on full screen and screen resolution is great

Cons:
1. Rear camera "48mega pixel" labeled is just hipe, pic quality/resolution is nowhere near 16mega pixel, because I compared with pics from Galaxy S8.
2. I need to experience more and add more points

I have bought this phone recently through Amazon and I am very happy with this. Best budget phone in the category.
Pros- 1. Performance is very good.
2. Camera quality is superb.
3. 6000 Mah battery gives you freedom to go anywhere without charging. After buying this phone I forget to use power banks at all.
4. No heating problem.
5. Sound quality is very good.
6. 6.4 inch Amoled display gives high quality display and resolution. Also it does not impact your eyes if you watch movies or online content for long duration.
I did not find any cons. Suggest you just go for it. Don't think too much to buy this phone. In this range you are getting good quality and customer satisfaction promise by Samsung brand. You can't compare this phone with other brands phone because this phone is superior in all parameters itself. Thanks.

This phone is a beast.I am not a selfie person so ,no comments about the camera but ram management and battery life is awesome.
Screen quality is epic.Phone is really comfortable to handle and use.
Samsung one UI is also tolerable ,being a one plus user for 3 years, it's not a lot down.
One plus UI is better no doubt but this is a fresh take on android for me ,I loved it.
Battery works easily for one and a half day easily.
Explore the settings and u can mute the unnecessary noises and display quirks which may seem irritating.

But I have to hand it to Samsung ,this is value for money.Even if this phone holds its ground for an year I guess I would be super happy.

After a months usage I can say that the phone is worth the money .

Got monster phone with great battery life, features and price. Dolby sound, auto brightness adjustment, and good processes. But camera was not up to the mark. It takes lot of time to save one click and clarity of camera is not as mentioned. If you don't have camera concern then go for it. Samsung provided fast charging but takes around 2:30 to 3 hrs for full charging and drains little faster. Greate amazon services as delivered before time and person was very pleasant.

one of the amazing phone by samsung till now that to in the affordable budget and premium features such as good triple camera, sleek design , amazing battery power, powerful processor that supports games like pubg at UltraHD play mode.
I was confused between buying Realme and samsung at this price range and finally decided to go with this phone and phone is too good with all features in it.
Camera pictures are àlso too good.
Battery in this phone is beast which you will not get in this range of phone and that too with light weight of the phone.
Look of the phone is good and opal black is awesome which provide the colour combination of two at the back of the phone.
Charging also don't take so much time as compared with battery provided in this phone.
Processor of this phone is awesome and you will not find any lag in the performance even while having heavy usage of the phone.
phone comes up with all the great features in come device which you will not get in other phones in this price range.
So go with this phone without thinking any other phone as you will not get this beast from any other brands available in market.

Amazing camera quality.. I suppose no match in the price range for camera even the close competitor. Processor is good no heating issues as of yet even with heavy gaming, battery backup is better but I was expecting it to be a big improvement over 5000 mah but it's just a bit more than the previous one. But still it's a good and much needed improvement. The built quality touch and overall feel is amazing(for which Samsung is known). I would recommend it over the alternatives having personally used both. Samsung in my opinion has come up with a market oriented phone, the game changing improvement I feel is Samsung UI being better than others. Overall go for it.

I am using this product from past 1 week. I purchased it on amazon and i got the mob in just 1 day. It is working perfectly.
Camera quality is really good and also security features are awesome. We have lot of options and different sensors which is working smoothly. Mobile is not heating while playing games and also while charging. Reg battery capacity its perfect since we are using 6000mAh which is gigantic one. Charging is very quick with fast charging options C type charger. Design and product quality is really good. Weight is not much more. It is easy for handling as well. Worth for money. If you want to buy a mobile for 15K you can go for this mobile so that you will get all the facilities what you are expecting.

Brand consious people, just close your eyes and go for it. With this price range it is a great deal.
Regarding battery: Though it has huge battery, it doesn't feel heavier at all. Weight is evenly distributed. Juice will last for at least 1 and half days even for heavy user.

Regarding look and feel, I thought it may be bulky while placing order, but to my surprise it is slick enough. It is not metal body but you will ger the same gorgeous feel.

Nothing to say about screen as I am big fan of Samsung super AMOLED screen. You will not be disappointed.

Fingerprint reader is somtime having bit issue but 80% time it is smooth.

Now comes the Camera... Simply superb. Even my 51k valued another good brand mobile (not one plus) can not match the quality with this one. I am impressed. I didn't expect such a great quality of images in this category.

Now few negative points ( we can not expect in this range), not water proof/splash proof/shock proof.
No headset, packaging is also very minimal and charging cable is hardly 0.30 meters.

Overall it is a great deal with one year screen replacement benefit.

There is a serious heating problem at the earpiece area even for a 5 minute call.. very much afraid to keep the phone in handheld mode. The battery life is not as expected or drains faster .. not sure it gets fine as it goes. The full screen functionality also is not user friendly.. Also there was never any mention of the screen warranty while buying but next  day it said your warranty is withdrawn as you requested .. I have never requested attach or detach but.

Fingerprint scanner is work well but 5 Out of 2 changes he doesn't recognize my fingerprint. Camera is very good, while we take slow motion video he doesn't do any frame drop ,  clearity of image is very good . Main problem of phone is regarding with connectivity,  whenever my another phones are having good signal but this phone shows no signal , when I use wifi then battery consumption rate is increasing by 5 to 10%

I bought 6gb model. I think its a great phone. I got it for my mother and she is happy with the performance. Battery life is great. I think there should be more colour options in phone. Existing one are not so great. Camera is not brilliant but does the work. Wide angle photo features are good. Processor speed is also good. Everything opens fsst without any lag. Overall a good phone in decent price.

* Screen is treat to look at. Watching videos is first class experience.
* No heating or lag observed in what ever little gaming I did.
* Build quality is nice.
* Gud ram mgmt.
* Android 1 is buttery smooth. Minimal app overhead which can b easily uninstalled.
* Charging is not superfast but wid given bettery size I would say it's pretty fast.
* Fingerprint &amp; face unlock both working gr8.
* Call quality &amp; signal reception both good. Also wifi connection working properly.
D only con I observed in dis brief tenure is der is no way to put data rate displaying at the status bar.

Phone is good.  Easy to use in everyday life.
Pros.
1. Display
2. Battery
3. UI
4. Fast charging.
These display is superb as expected from a Samsung phone. Great colors and sharpness of images.
Battery is so good. It easily lasts more than a day for the average user. I used to charge my old phone more than 4 times a day(iPhone 5S).
Samsung's UI is so easy to use and impressive. All of my friends also loved it.
Fast charging is impressive given the huge battery. It charges the phone to about 80% from 0 in about 2 hours.
Cons.
1. Finger print reader
2. Camera quality
3. No screen guard or case out of the box.
Finger print sensor is very slow compared to the competitions.
Camera quality is not up to the mark as expected.

Overall experience is that there phone is good for the price paid and i would certainly recommend it if you would like to own a phone that cam last all day and give you a descend performance.

It's been a fortnight since i bought this mobile. The mobile is heavier than i expected. I am currently using Samsung S8 and when i bought this mobile and started using it's been a bit difficult for me to adjust to the display. I know it's the best we can get at this price range. And it's flawless too.
So comparing to proce range and the display provided Samsung reached expectations.
The front camera is good enough but the competitor are providing a better one. Back camera photos are awesome. The pictur/scene sensor option is pretty good.
Battery life is extraordinary. I am gaming like 8 hours a day still it lasts one day. For a minimal use it will stand surely for 3 days.
And charging is pretty fast.

Body is plastic had that been a metal body it would be outstanding. But considering the price range it's good.
Finger print sensor and facial recognition are pretty fast.

No lagging on normal usage. But it's lagging while gaming and if you get a call mobile froze twice. I needed to reboot it twice.

PROs:
♡ Awesome S-Amoled display
♡ Always on Display (My personal favorite!)
♡ Great battery 6000 mAh
♡ Value for money specs (6 + 128 GB)
♡ Fast processor and fluid software experience without any ads (Coming from MIUI)
♡ Can play PUBG, Call Of Duty, Asphalt 9 on High quality and High FPS mode, smooth high quality  gameplay!

CONS:
¤ Average/ Mediocre camera quality... Not a good phone to take selfies or pics of people. I found my old Mi far more better
¤ Coming from MIUI, ONE UI lacks some features like network speed, full screen gestures, beta versions, faster updates, better signal reception etc...
¤ Although it's 6000mAh, I need to charge my phone every day with moderate usage.
¤ Less network reception compared to Mi phone
(PS: Low network signal will drain your battery faster than anything else!)
¤ Because of AMOLED display and plastic back, it's very vulnerable to scratches and breakage,  so need to buy high quality tempered glass and back cover to protect it.

VERDICT:
Superb Budget under 20k smartphone.
BEST to buy this if display, battery and performance  is your priority.
DON'T BUY THIS  FOR CAMERA!

Poor quality product, poor battery life, fake camera specifications declared by Samsung, display is yellowish looks very cheap. Battery backup can't beat even 3500mah battery phone of MI. Overall Samsung has launched this phone just to compete with MI but they only know to make high price product with cheap quality like note series of Samsung. This phones price is 15k+ and this just waste. Mi, Realme, Vivo and other key brand having far better performing phones with less pricing. Shame on Samsung such a frod company.

3.48 MP camera ?? No it isn't, something is wrong with it.

This is my first Samsung device and I have been using this for 2 months now. Here's my honest opinion on Galaxy M30s.

Samsung marketed this phone as a Monster,
and I must say that it's indeed a monster when it comes to battery life. I'll talk about it in detail further in this review.

Display: For a device in this price point , the display is awesome, I love the sAMOLED display on this phone, it sports a 6.4 inch full-HD+ display with a dewdrop notch at the top. Watching Netflix and Amazon prime in HDR makes the whole experience immersive. Samsung nails it when it comes to displays on smartphone.

Camera: The cameras see a significant upgrade from its predecessor M30. Images captured via the main camera in broad daylight are super bright and very colorful. The 48 Mp shooter captures even more details with high contrast, but the images sometimes come out with too much noise and tend to pixelate when you zoom into the picture. The autofocus used to struggle while focussing on subjects that are very close but a recent software update has seemed to fixed it. Selfies come out smooth but there should be some sharpness. When it comes to low light photography, the camera lacked detail and images were quite grainy. Night mode fixes the brightness but you need to be careful while using it. Now coming to macro shots, photos taken in macro mode were good you can thank the 5 Mp depth sensor for the same.
Videos can be recorded in 4K and there's a super steady mode as the phone lacks OIS but it does a pretty good job.
There's also an AI scene optimiser, which is quite fast in recognizing the subject and adjusts camera settings accordingly. This is super helpful especially for people who don't like to dive into pro mode and just want some great looking pictures.

Battery: When it comes to the battery this device is an actual monster. Battery life is good on this device, I easily manage to get SOT ranging from 12-16 hours with an average battery life of 1.6 days which is enough for me considering my usage. The processor seems to be very well optimised when it comes to gaming. I play graphic intense games like pubg or COD and the battery holds up pretty well. The device gets slightly warm but that can be blamed on the plastic frame which does not dissipates heat properly like aluminum frames. It's not that warm though but its noticeable.

Build quality: The build quality is average. Plastic frames doesnt seem to be that durable. There's also no gorilla glass protection for the front glass so beware if you have no protection plans as they might be heavy on your pocket.

I did lot of research to get a balance between cost, quality and convenience. This phone has it all and is best is in class in this segment. Due to 128gb storage, music and video becomes easy and economical to store so that u can view or listen again and again as per your convenience.  Internet is fast than other phones. Camera features are great. In fact folder management from gallery is super convenient to do it on fly. No longer we need to sit in front of computer to sort pictures and files.  Something which even iPhone doesn't have yet. All in all, this phone is worth every penny and saying this almost post 2 months of purchase.

The phone's performance is quite good....but the camera quality is slightly on the lower side. Not that great as expected ...... the battery as mentioned "6000 mah" not that great but good enough for a complete day use .. That's all I would end up by saying that the phone is worth buying and has a good value for money.

When it comes to this price range, I have to admit that this phone has performed beyond expectations. The amoled display and the superb battery life helps me watch Movies and play games non-stop for more than 24 hours. Trust me, with fair usages you don't need to take a look at the charger for 2 days.

The screen is a 6.4 inch full HD+ AMOLED display with a comfortably placed dewdrop notch at the top.

Lucky for me it has a 3.5 mm headphones jack, with decent quality audio output, along with a USB  C type port, so you can still listen to your songs while you charge 😅

The phone is super light, considering its huge battery life, and even my friends Rs. 50k flagship phones feels bulky around this device.

It literally never gets stuck with any application I have used so far, thanks to its flagship Exynos 9611 SoC.

I have the One UI 1.5 on top of Android 9 Pie powering this device and literally there are a lot of customisation you could do with it.

If you play PUBG like me, 30 mins. to gameplay only drains around 5% battery. And don't worry coz it comes with a 15W fast charger, so you start having your "chicken dinners"(PUBG Reference) in no time.

When it comes to camera performance, it operates great during day time and is pretty decent at nights.

Even though it comes with some pre-installed apps, you can easily remove them at your own free will.

Overall, I am using this device for around 3 months and is very happy with it, and hope to get around with it for a pretty long time, after all the nice sapphire blue colour in it's back cover is not going to go out of fashion anytime soon.

PROS:
1. Screen Ratio &amp; Display resolution is impressive to watch HD videos/movies/games
2. Finger-print sensor is placed backside which is easy to unlock as compared to those phones having sensor in front display screen
3. Face unlock camera is unimaginably fast in this price range
4. Speed of phone is lightning fast
5. Camera is equipped with super slow-motion HD recording (see attached video) which is excellent
6. Free Themes/Icons are available on Galaxy store specifically for this phone for different phone using/viewing experience
7. Sound option is coming with Dolby Atmos for headphone. It feels superb during gaming/watching action movies
8. Display glass is scratch resistant &amp; endurance level is quite high

CON:
Plastic back cover…(but one can buy toughened glass back cover from open market in approx. ₹300/-

I've been using this phone for around 2 months and here are some of the pros and cons after ample amount of usage.
Pros:
1. Decent camera: Rear 48mp triple camera works really great even in low light. Wide angle, portrait, superslow motion, slowmotion, hyperlapse all are really optimised to give best shots and videos 📷 📹
2. Performance: With 6 GB RAM and SAMSUNG'S chipset games like PUBG and CoD runs with almost no lag under medium graphic settings
3. Display: The super amoled display is so great that you can watch tiniest details in a 1080 video.
4. Battery: Battery is the main feature of this phone. In light usage this phone can last for almost 2 days (Music, Whatsapp, Youtube). In medium usage this goes down to almost 36 hours (Youtube, Instagram, Video Recording). In extreme usage this phone can last upto 18-20 hours (Google maps, PUBG, CoD etc all the time). You can never expect this phone to die on your face. The SAMSUNG'S BMS is just awesome.⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
5. Face recognition is great

Cons
1. Speakers: Doesn't delivers the performance which you'll get in high end phones but justifies with the price
2. Fingerprint:  A little difficult to access as it is on the back.. Not work properly if it is slightly dirty (oil, sweat etc)
3. Weight:  You can clearly feel the bigger battery's weight on your palm

Neutral points:
1. The body construction is of plastic material but the build quality is very good.
2. Doesn't comes with a lot of gestures but it does have some handy ones like double tap to wake, screen wakes when taken out of pocket

Overall this phone is best in it's segment as it delivers all the essentials of a decent phone and within a very impossible price.

The best part is, it is a Samsung product which is known for its quality compliance and customer service.😃

Received defective phone and charger again after the replacement post feedback taken by Samsung. Initially ordered the phone then had issues with charging as it was taking 3-4 hours to full charge the phone so Samsung got the phone replaced via Amazon. The replaced phone worked well just for few days untill charger stopped working . I was asked to visit the Samsung Customer care where they informed that the problem is with both charger and charging slot in the mobile. Since this is new phone they do not have the parts to repair this.
I then contacted Samsung as I did not want to repair the new phone and asked them to get the phone replaced and they denied to do so and suggested to exchange the phone through zsamsung website.

I was never the fan of Samsung and now I am stuck with faulty mobile and charger

Everything is positive in this phone wrt to me ,really I m not exaggerating, amazing SAmoled display, decent camera for the price,massive nealy 6000mah battery which will do the job for 2 day's with moderate use. RAM is decent enough to function the phone smoothly. Only one drawback I found is the plastic back case which is making cracking noise,  but its necessary to reduce the weight I hope, but a decent case will solve the issue.
Since I won't play games I m not aware of gaming experience.
Over all my experience is great with my Samsung M30s.
I would definitely recommend for my friends.

Firstly I bought M30s due to huge battery. But battery drains out quickly. Fully charged battery runs out of juice in half day while watching few videos, calling and browsing. Not working like a 6000 mah. Please like if u find the review useful.

The name monster battery justifies its performances. And the quick charge feature adds on to it. I got the Sapphire Blue colour unit, which will certainly appeal to those who like their handsets a bit jazzy. The colours on the back transition horizontally from Sapphire to Turquoise.The back houses the triple rear camera on the top left corner in a non-protruding camera bump makes it look even more jazzy.
As far as the hardware specs are concerned, Samsung Galaxy M30s is powered by its own Exynos 9611 processor with Mali G72 GPU which enables multi tasking without any hiccups.The most distinctive part about this UI is the easier single-handed use courtesy the UI design, which allows users to pull down most system apps and menus so they are within reach while using the smartphone with one hand.When it comes to the image quality of the pictures captured by the Samsung Galaxy M30s, the primary camera does a good job for both daylight and standard in-house lighting. The colours turn out to be punchy and the details of the object are not lost. Even the ultra wide-angle camera is a dependable sensor when it comes to capturing legitimate colours. The Samsung Galaxy M30s offers an Infinity-U display, a.k.a water drop notch. The bezels of the screen are acutely thin on the sides but comparatively thicker at the bottom. As for the display specification, Samsung has offered a full-HD+ resolution (1080 x 2340 pixels) Super AMOLED display of 6.4-inch in size. With  Galaxy M30s, Samsung finally seems to be catching up with the Chinese handset players as it seems to be a complete package at the asking price of Rs 13,999 for the base variant.

Okay, so after 1 month of usage i quiet like the phone. I prefer lighter phone and despite of having a 6000mah battery its not heavy at all.
Camera is u can see, u just need a good hand to click pics. I mean in normal light its pretty amazing. But kinda sucks in low light.
Well, the phone is fast AF.
And the battery OMG!! I am not a heavy game player so it last 1 day and sometimes even more...Fingerprint sensor is fast but ergonomically it's little bit mis-placed. The UI is good but it could be better, hope that in next updates it will be. I'm very much obsessed with colors but this white color is good, and as its slim so it looks professional. Thats what i wanted.
15W charger is also no joke guyz, remember the days when we dont even use bother about charger power and all. But!! I mean Samsung see its a very large battery.
And lastly Amazon thanks for such a fast delivery... and also for the pay balance.

In this price, its really a very good phone. I think u should Go For It.

Well I have been using M30S from last one week and the experience has been great so far, its different from other mid range phones as it has that 6000 MAH massive battery and Super Amoled Display which is a stand out from the crowd in this segment.
This is what I feel about the different features of M30S-
Display - M30s sports a massive 6.4 inch super amoled display with massive screen to body ratio of over 90 percent and honestly after using it from past one week, I can easily say this display is flagship level without any doubt!

Performance -
Exynos 9611 is a beast, it is handling day to day tasks with ease and multi tasking is a pleasure on this device and I have played a few heavy games too and I can easily say experience was fantastic!

Camera -
With its triple camera setup,
experience of photography on this device is flagship level specially when it comes to its 48MP primary camera, it clicks bright and clear pictures any time of the day and especially with its night mode feature, night photography experience is on the next level, wide angle shots have great dynamic range and depth shots have flagship level background blur effect, overall cameras on M30S perform better compared to the competition and I think its best in this segment
Battery -
Now coming to the battery department, its 6000 MAH battery with Exynos 9611 battery optimisations just doesn't accept to die, its easily lasting me for 1.5-2 days at heavy usage and with 15 Watts fast charging, it charges quickly as well. What more can u ask in the battery department. This device is a battery champion without any doubt!

To summarise, M30S packs every feature that you would expect in a perfect mid range device. I recommend this device strongly to every person who wants a perfect mid ranger under 15K.

Samsung M30s is very nice phone.
Pros:
1. Long lasting Battery life.
2. Back Camera quality.
3. No heating.
4. Back camera not popped out. Well within the surface.
5. Dedicated memory slot apart from 2 SIMS slots.

Cons:
1. Finger scan at behind is little inconvenient especially while charging the phone.
2. Selfie camera is not that clean or sharp. Doesnt feel like 16MP.
3. Charging takes time. Full Charging takes about 2 hours 40 minutes. But that may be due to higher Battery capacity. If you plan your charging in advance this drawback is not of much relevance.

Overall it is best buy for the price. I compared it with Redmi Note 8 pro. But went with Samsung M30s. The Brand name, Higher Battery life and dedicated external memory slot apart from 2 sims tilted my decision in favour of M30s.

And finally the product is Manufactured in India:)

I am using this phone for last 12 days. It's an awesome phone and below are my experiences with this phone so far...
Prons:-
1. Huge battery, battery  backup is awesome. Battery backup depend on usage however It's easily last for more than 1.5 day for moderate use.
2. Display is super awesome. You will love it.
3. System UI (one ui) is classic. You you this UI. Earlier I was using stock android operating system, so I found this UI better than that.
4. Rear camera performance is very good, please  remember it's a 14k phone so please don't compare it with 30k phone's.
5. Processor Exny9611 performance is very good no problem at day to day use. I m not a gaming freak person,  but so far all games run smoothly.
 Cons:-
1. Front camera need improvements. It's an average camera.
2. Fingerprint sensor is good, but I expect it to be performed better.

Overall considering the 14k price it's an awesome phone with brand name Samsung. You can't compare it with low quality brand like redmi, realms, oppo, vivo in my personal  point of view.

Bought  this phone on first day of the release.
Amazon made sure that it was delivered within 24 hours.. Full marks to Amazon for that..

After using for 4-5 days, here is my review:

Awesome display,
Camera's Quality is great,
Feels really light weight and Phone is quite compact..
No heating problem for my phone.
Samsung's UI feels great to use.
Dual account for watsapp/messenger etc.

This is my first Samsung phone after Galaxy Grand, and I am not facing any lag/hanging issues.

Theme experience is also great. I would have loved some Inbuilt Applocker which I am missing.

The only issue I am facing is battery backup.. Although it's up and running for a 20-24 hours after moderate use, I expected more from 6000mah. (Dont know whether the issue is in my device only)
Charging is little slow, which is obviously the case because of huge battery.

Comes with few bloatware of which some can be uninstalled and some can be disabled.

Few updates in Camera and other features can be provided by Samsung to make the most of it.

Overall, Great buy in this price range.

Despite having a huge battery the weight of the phone very light. Display is very good, but it should have gorilla glass protection. About the build quality, the phone is good, but some crackle sound come from the back side. Camera quality is good, night mode is good enough.

Overall the phone is very good. The things I wanted from phone are low weight, long battery life, display ( display is amazing ).

One more thing the company should give at least 18w fast charger , so that It would have been much better to charge the phone faster.
Otherwise no complaint about the phone. It's a very good phone, perfectly fit into my requirements.

One more thing there is lot of bloatwares which are consuming a lot of ram. There is no enough ram left as we compare it with moto g⁵Gs plus, it gives more ram free.

But the available ram is not affecting the phone performance till now.

I bought this Samsung m30s mobile in early prime access sale 2 days ago. I got a cash back of 1000 in my amazon wallet too. Bought this for 13999.Amazing Amazon delivered it within 1 day even in such busy days.

Samsung m30s
============

Phone is sturdy and light. Not feather lite, but for 6000mah monster battery inside, I felt it to be surprisingly light. Packed with triple camera, the photos come in with a decent depth , colour and excellent quality. Samsung also has portrait mode, food mode, wide angle mode , night mode, live focus, slow mode, super slow mode and hyperlapse to choose from. Battery life comes for upto one and a half day for a normal usage . Sound quality is good. The speaker volume is amazingly high.

It has super AMOLED display which is a surprise at this price range(along with other features it hosted). Front camera is 16mp to click yourself better than ever. I've noticed the photos clicked with Front camera are made soft. But there must be some setting which I should enable or disable.

Overall the phone is doing a very good job at this price range. I haven't observed any cons yet apart from too soft selfies.

b). In-built Call recording feature is awesome ,great job by samsung . Not need to install any app from playstore.

c).Dolby atmos sound setting etc. all these small features are matters a lot in day to day activities which others phone not look after it.

Likes:
1. Best thing is the screen, its super premium and smooth.
2. Battery is massive and gives me around 38 hours of
 usage.
3. PUBG and COD runs smooth and lags free, no heating issues till now. (can't say for continous 4+ hours gamers)
4. Camera is awesome in daylight, natural colour reproduction both for photo and videos, video stabilization is good. (Night mode lacks details, it just adds exposure, thats it!)
5. Overall weight feels less unexpectedly, even it has massive battery pack.
6. Samsung processor feels quite powerful and RAM management is great.
7. The new One UI by samsung is smooth like butter.

Dislikes:
1. Fingerprint scanner doesn't works everytime and its slow. (Samsung may fix it with software updates).
2. 10 watt charger provided in box is naturally slow for 6000 mAH battery, though its called fast charger. (it couldbe atleast 20watts)
3. Policarbonate back gives cracking sound when squeezed on palm.

Overall a super awesome buy under 14000.

From begins of the mobile uses I am loving this brand.The most trusted brand in India.

1.Fingerprint scanner is 10/10
2.Face reader also work smooth,I like to giving the point 10/10.
3.I am not the PUBG lover,and not interested kind of game,but like to watch video song fromYouTube, surfing Facebook etc,including these i was busy in phone call for hole day,although my battery lasting for 3 days without any hassle. Battery is also 10/10
4.In the phone description i was not found the  DOLBY ATOM sound,but it has so.And it feel very smooth and crystal clear.
5.Speaker also so clear,it also 10/10.
6.Front camera is very smooth,I like to giving the mark 10/10.
7.Back camera is also the same 10/10.
8.Exnos 9611 it has,phone is running smoothly.

I find here all the things with above my expectation.My previous smart phone was Samsung Galaxy J7 next.Samsung work here very good in the low budget phone.All the things which I was expected from a smartphone with just for rupees 14k it has so.Why should I go with the China brand,.With all the China brand the most common thing will happen which is disappointment.My two friends were purchased the Note 7 pro,and note 6 pro.Note 7 pro has the 48 mp camera,but when they had sent me any photo from their phone it like only 5/8 mp.If your money is value for you,why go for another brand,definitely you should go with the Indias most trusted brand SAMSUNG.

The phone is great. Plus the battery life is amazing. After using it for a week j can say it's worth it. The offer on Amazon was great. Got the Phone in Rs. 11772 only. The finger print reader works nicely. The picture quality is great. Back camera clicks amazing shots. Selfies comes out very nice and natural.
I would recommend it buying it for anyone who wants a great battery life and amazing camera quality.

I was eagerly waiting for a phone like Samsung M30s which is loaded with all the latest features from a reliable brand like Samsung.
I purchased M30s(Sapphire Blue) on day of its launch 29th Sep and have been using it heavily since then. Below are my review comments:
- Battery: Monster 6000mAh battery lets me use the phone on a single charge for two consecutive days. I have been browsing social media sites like twitter, FB quite frequently, streaming videos from youtube regularly still it lasts two days on single charge.

- Camera: Highly impressed by the 48mp triple camera setup which give crisp detailed images and allows to capture wide angle images. I could only dream to have 48MP camera from reliable brand like Samsung in this price range.

- Display: Super Amoled display is amazing. Impressed by the display quality while watching videos on the phone.

- Performance: I have installed several apps since i got the phone and have been happy with the performance of the Exynos processor. Very responsive with zero lag.

- Dual Sim: Phone comes with dual sim and a dedicated memory card slot.

- Sound: Sound quality is top notch. Have been listening to music using headphones. Impressed by the sound quality.

- Fingerprint/Face sensor: Both fingerprint and facial recognition are blazing fast.

- Fast Charger: Fast Charger is included which charges the 6000mAH battery pretty fast.

Finally the phone is Made in India and i really appreciate the Make For India initiative from Samsung. I would request everyone to support Samsung as its trusted brand supporting Make in India initiative.

I had a good feel when I received it.  But after using for a month or so this phone started showing its problems.  The phone is not receiving calls!!  It has serious issues and thus I had to restart every morning to take up calls.  The internet is not stable, I had to even replace my SIM card, I guess it is due to some circuit issue with this phone.  I bought this seeing the massive battery and cheaper price.  But it is disappointing results now as it almost started not able to use.  The camera is also mediocre, the images are not good most of the time shaky picture.

Pros:
*superb battery life ,got 2 days battery with moderate use
*good screen quality, yeah it's super amoled so no doubt, you'll get immersive screen experience
*good speaker quality and it's quiet loud
*good earpiece speaker quality
*feels like premium in hand especially the opal black varient
*Even though I'm not a hardcore gamer, to check the phone's performance I've played pubg mobile, I didn't experienced any lag and played quite well in high graphics
*even though it's having whopping 6000mah battery, it didn't feel that heavy.And weight is evenly distributed.
*good call quality, I didn't experienced any signal drop or anything
*yeah it's Samsung, so you'll get very low SAR value So don't be panic about phone radiation or anything
*fast charging is there, So your bulky battery feel it's belly filled in 2.30 hours and Samsung provided a 15w fast charger as well.
*audio quality with 3.5 mm Jack is really good
*decent camera
*one ui is great, you'll get a good software experience with good features
Cons :
*No glass protection, Samsung said it has gorilla glass 3, but don't fall for it guys, it only takes one drop,your phone's display will be shattered in pieces. So be careful with it and always cover it with a good case and tempered glass
*main camera is decent but it has focus issues, hope sumsung will solve it with upcoming updates
*ultra wide camera is below average
*they said front camera is 16mp, but I didn't feel it like 16mp.my moto g4 plus's 5mp front camera is better than  this.
*Be careful with the plastic body, put a case and everything is fine
*fingerprint sensor is not that great and feel like cheap.it's a bit slower and sometimes it didn't recognize my finger.
 Conclusion:
 If you are guy that occasionally play games and take photos with phone, and don't give much on build quality, who need good video playing experience and ofcourse good battery life then this is your phone go for it..
NB: use dark mode for great experience and save battery life

At this price point, this is a great phone. It has met all my smartphone requirements - great display, smooth interface, 3.5mm jack, solid sound and of course, long lasting battery.

The only thing I wasn't happy with was the back design/color - the blue/black shade is weird. But if you are a back cover person it would not matter or my advice purchase the blue color. The front camera also could have been better, the picture clarity varies depending on the light conditions.

I am still figuring out the other cool features that this phone is equipped with but definitely a worthy purchase in this price segment!

Well, I saw this phone and decide to buy it despite its ugly camera setup or so I thought.
When it arrived I opened to check how ugly the camera looks and yes It was not at all ugly when you see the original device.
Advantages:
1.Decent Camera
2.Decent Battery Life
3.Looks far more beautiful than its peers in that price range(Mine is Sapphire Blue that also dons the turquoise colour)
4. Handling is pretty easy with one hand.
5. The RAM is superb handles multitasking with ease.
6. Speakers and Mics work flawlessly.

Dis-Advantages:
1. After switching on It slows down for a second or two then works fine.
2. No VoLTE support for Vodafone, Airtel, Idea(At least My device is not supporting it even after the update)
3. You would not find a decent Screen Protector at all. I tried a lot of them Still there was some space to be dusted by hands.

#GoMonster

So first of all, Thank you #amazondotin for delivering within 13hrs, wasn't expecting such a quick delivery even with prime.

Coming to the phone,

1. DESIGN AND DISPLAY - Phone looks sexy from the front all black when screen is turned off from back also it doesn't look bad even though it is made up of polycarbonate body (Opal black variant). Triple camera setup at back gives a new trendy but bulky look. Fingerprint sensor, power button and volume rockers are placed well within reach. Sim tray has 3slots for 2sims+1memory card It has 6.4-inch FHD+ (2340x1080) Super AMOLED Infinity-U display. You will get used the infinity U notch very soon and Display is bright enough for outdoor use. sAMOLED full HD plus looks really good. Switch to vivid for vibrant colors in screen mode.

2.SOFTWARE- One UI 1.5 on top of Android 9 Pie, similar to other galaxy  phone's. Digital Wellbeing, a popular Android Pie feature
is available along with the Wind Down mode which switches the screen to grayscale and sets
the phone to DND to help you unwind. There are a few other features such as Dual Messenger which doesn't need any other third party app. Since it is a budget smartphone, it has some bloatware, most of which can only be disabled. Preinstalled apps include Facebook, Netflix, Galaxy Store, OneDrive, and My Galaxy. Night mode, Blue light filter and Dolby atmos are other additional features.

3. PERFORMANCE- The Samsung Exynos 9611 with Mali-G72 GPU powering the smartphone ito capable of delivering a smooth experience without any hiccups(mine is 4GB/64GB variant). I wouldn't say phone is an absolute
beast but in my time with the phone and it's been more than 4 days it didn't slow down at any point. Game booster help to play high graphics  games like PUBG in optimized environment. Did notice some heat after continuously playing PUBG in high settings (HD+ultra and HDR+extreme for more than 2 hours Switching between apps is quick, RAM management is good, Simply put say good because PUBG stays in memory even when I chat with someone on WhatsApp, Instagram, snapchat etc. Finger print sensor is also quick, doesn't require multiple attempts to unlock. It has face unlock which is pretty good.

4. BATTERY - Yes one of the biggest selling points of this phone, Is It's huge 6000Mah battery, On my first full charge it took almost 2hr30m with 15W Type-C charger(18W would be better since it has huge battery) and was able to get more than 1.5 days of battery life going well into the evening of the day, with a Screen on Time of over 16hrs, Of course this was before installed PUBG, But still almost 2 days battery life is pretty impressive Light users will easily get 2 days of battery life and even if you add 2-3 Hours of PUBG in it you will still get two days out of your full charge.

5.CAMERA- This phone has triple camera setup at the back,consisting of a 48-MP primary sensor, a 8-MP wide-angle, a 5-MP depth sensor with LED flash light. The primary camera takes 12-MP shots by default, but you can capture 48-MP aspect ratio options. There are other features like Night mode,  Food, Pro mode, Paranoma, Live focus, Super Slow-mo, slow-mo, Hyperlapse to enhance photography. Switching to wide angle is easy with a toggle button on screen. It can record 4k videos and 1080p videos with EIS.
Front camera has 16-MP sensor to take selfies placed in U-notch and can record 1080p videos. Front shooter struggles in low light since it has no flash light.

SOUND-Sound is good from the speakers of this phone.Audio through the headphones is the best
have ever heard, lust select the rich setting from the Dolby app, the app really helps.

I am giving it 4/5 stars.
So I would appreciate if you upvote it if you liked it and it was useful to you.
Thanks.

Overall, this phone does the job perfectly for everyday uses. According to me, its  screen and battery life are the best. With 4GB RAM, Exynos 9611 processor and Mali-G72 MP3 GPU, this can handle pretty much anything thrown on to it. It looks really stylish too with the drop notch and Super - AMOLED display. Its fingerprint sensor is decent too. It also has Dolby Atmos support. The only con I had found out was that its camera quality is not upto the mark. When we capture an image with the 3:4 (48MP) mode, the image starts pixelating. Now, I  really don't care about the camera quality as I am not much into photography. But with a monster 6000mAh battery backup and a sleek and lightweight design, I think this phone is the best bang for the buck in this price range.

So after using 3 days I am writing this review.
Display 5/5
  Because with the super amoled display it looks so stunning. You will find it so colourful when you stream a 720p or 1080p video.
Battery 5/5
  Only one word needed to describe the battery of this phone and that is 6000mah. If you are a light user, the battery will go upto 2-3 days. If you are a heavy user, playing games for a long time,watching movies for 3 hours,still it will go for 1.5-2 days. So good battery back-up.
Camera 4.5/5
  Okay now this is not a very normal camera that we can use very easily. You have to have little knowledge about photography before usng the camera. Then you can use it at pro level. For those who know photography well,they can click stunning pictures. 48 mp with extra depth and live focus is absolutely amazing. Talking about the selfie camera,16 mp is little over. It gives you a decent picture,a good quality picture but it doesn't look like 16 mp. Also to add, wide angle camera is one of the good feature that you have.
Gaming 4.5/5
  I have played pubg and COD in this mobile. The only problem is if you play for long 2-3 hours,it will be little heated. The back panel near the rear camera will be heated.  But while gaming there will be no lag issues,minor frame drop and decent battery. Game booster helps you uninterrupted gaming facility.
Fingerprint sensor is really fast, face unlock is also good.

I hope you find this helpful.

I am really disappointed with camera quality . Camera quality is like very basic model and its fake brightness. Better buy redmi phone instead of this phone .

Comment for developers of this phone.
Some times video start failed. You will get video failed message. You need to restart the device to get rid of the error message.

Overall . Its below average and just created hype .

I want to know who gave this as no1 mobile

Got it a little early than accepted , going to spec's and review
First looking at the display , at this price point marvelous and unbelievable  at this price point.  Going deep in to phone
1. Display 9/10
2. Sound 8/10 (reduced score is for placement of speaker when your in a game or watching a video finger will close it for sure and it's a mono speaker that's the main problem )
3. Battery 10/10 (once in 2 days, tried to drain completely but it stayed at 13 % even after 2 days )
4. Camera 7/10 (works good with good lighting and steady hands , pixel density is very less and 48mp is just a word , front camera is not that great as well beautifies a little even in default settings, check some of the pictures I took with adequate lighting conditions)
5. Design - 8/10 (only problem is with colour accidentally place sapphire blue bit odd colouring if your in a crowd and placement of buttons both volume and power button ok the same side, other than that design is great , especially the display)
6. Perfomance - 8.5/10 (Great at this price point and good with graphics and speed )

Samsung M30s is what we all need within a good price deal. I find this mobile best under 20k.
The camera quality is very nice rear as well as front
The security comes with face recognition, finger print scanner, the sensor is very quick
For a gammer it is best as I have played PUBG and Call Of Duty-it runs smooth.
After using the phone for a day it is just 25% drained out, its batter really last long and does charge quickly
It also has Dolby Atmos on earphone and BT headset
You can use 4G sim on both the slot
Despite huge batter power the phone does not weight much
It has FHD display
I don't find any cons in this phone, but would be better if ear phone was provided in the box

I had purchased M20 earlier and not bought this M30s Phone. To my surprise, it's much better than my expectation. Samsung has done an amazing job by introducing M Series. it come with hell lot of features without denting your pockets for ex: Finger print, Face unlock &amp; many more in less then INR 15K..it's simply amazing. You may have more options in market but they still can't beat Samsung &amp; Apple quality. These are premium products! Highly recommended phone for this budget.
Performance A+
Battery A+
Appearance (Look &amp; feel) A+
Playing PubG Experience A
User Friendly A++
Over 9.5 / 10 from my side

Display is excellent.
Slow motion &amp; wide angle camera option is too good
Extra slow motion &amp; food camera option is new features seen
Overall it is good experience in medium budget phone.
Samsung really now in competition with high end line one plus &amp; Chinese like MI
Overall good phone

I purchased this phone for my dad as the specs was amazing with the monster battery. Got this delivered in a day. First impression of the product was good and the blue colour looks a little green from the side. Built quantity wise is ok.. plastic feel and I just hope it last because when you hold it you can feel the plastic creek at times.. so I removing one star because of this. From price point this is satisfactory so no complains here..

Amazing phone indeed. though its been only few days. Still I must appreciate the phone have:
 1. Amazing battery Life
  I am working professional and only looking for a phone with good battery.. M30s is super fantastic I have been charging it after 36 hours only..

2.phone is very fast and responsive to commands and fingerprint identification.

3. Camera was way above than expectation as my budget was not much i was ready to forgo Camera Quality ...but this deal has mesmerized me with great camera of 48+8+5mp rear and 16 mp front camera.. And my daughters are enjoying taking selfies

4. I would say more than perfect deal i ve got with this phone this Diwali.. Samsung Brand + Super Battery + Dashing style that resembles Iphone 11 and above all just 13999/-

Honestly... I am very happy.

I am not a heavy user (with respect to gaming etc) and needed something with decent battery life which lets me carry on with my daily tasks including emails, twitter etc. This phone meets the expectations but I still think battery isn't as good as I thought. I had Lenovo P2 before and that phone happily worked for 2 days before needing charge. This phone does not last beyond 1.5 days at best.

Had the access to order the phone on Amazon on 28th September as soon as the sale started. As usual Amazon kept their promise of delivering the phone on 29th morning, I was amazed with the speed of the delivery.  Phone had the fast charger ,type c cable ,sim ejector and manuals and we do not get hand free with this model. I find the touch sensitivity is amazing and for 6000 MAH battery the phone is expected to be bulky but M30 S stands out here with the sleek design, with 6 GB ram phone turns out to be pretty fast , s Amoled display is good while watching videos and photos . I find performance of the camera is good . No official information available about gorilla glass screen ,I feel gorilla screen should be provided at the back casing too to avoid scratches and also samsung should provide back cover along with the phone .  About the battery as expected it is a monster and would stay for at least one full day for a heavy users otherwise it can with stand 2 days . Amazing phone at amazing price with great discounts through sbi card and cash back .Thank you amazon for the best offers and delivery commitment

I am die hart fan of Samsung due to easy UI.
But trust me I am using Samsung since they launch android phones. Honestly review is any Samsung phone gets slower after 6months. You must factory reset them to get little bit faster.

Now abt this m30s  Only only battery is good nothing else is good
If you feel better choice under 15k then it is wrong decision.
Mainly camera is not adequate as per mega pixel Samsung E7 camera is far better than this.

The main reason I bought this phone was for trying out the exynos processor, and I must say that it has so far been a good experience after using this phone for more than two months. The Super AMOLED screen is really awesome and it helps me a lot in my daily browsing and daily reads. The Camera is decent and it has the capability to compete with certain premium phone cameras. I feel that it could gave been better. Though it's a 48Mp camera, a lot of details are lost while zooming in a clicked picture. Battery backup is the best part and something that I haven't experienced so far. There are certain apps that come along packaged with the OS, I wish I could uninstall them rather than disabling them. The back case could have some stylish design so make it stand out. The plastic case is fine as it would make phone weigh light. Finger based unlocking could be much more better.

After use of about 3 months , overall review is good even after 24hrs of hard use the battery backup was excellent.after a full charge 100% I got it for 22+hrs .Camera quality was good but not much as expected , even though capture good photos.Fingerprint reader and face unlock felt littile bit lag for me .even it can sense finger in wet conditions too it's a good but the lag of micro seconds could not be disappointing to a regular customer.
Build quality
No Gorilla glass protection and covered with plastc type material not metal.Then also Samsung not providing us no back cases n screen guards at least back case should be given that much disappointing one. Expecially for one who watched m30s drop test!!!.
First one I got was damaged!
I got one product in a damaged way I don't know it's problem or not any way below the lock button I can hear tik sound while pressing I feel it like void space because of improper gluing.any way I requested for a replacement.I will update as I get a new one.
Its editted review i got tht product changed.

Bitt camera quality ,finger print and face unlock lag continues, also finger print not recogonize if our finger is wet.
 Overall it's 3.5/5 good one faster smoother ,never felt lag even after this much hard use.i loved it

Received a defective product, waiting for Amazon to resolve.
Phone is ok. The mutch hyped battery doesn't do any wonders as such. Camera output is cosmetic. Feels like you own a Chinese phone with always on beauty plus. (Mind you this is without any skin tone or effects). Lots of grains. Wide angle is even bad, its nothing more than a fish eye effect producing non usable images with edges completely washed out.
48 mp, lmao

Got my phone a day before.3 or 4times had signal drop(unable to receive calls or give calls ) so had to restart my phone repeatedly.
Asked for help from customer support they had arranged for a technician visit after 2 days .Based on his report then they will take up a complaint itseems.
It is always better to buy from a store is what i suggest

Got the product the next day of ordering it. Camera quality is good. Fingerprint reader isn't that great as it takes a while to even sense that I have a finger on the reader. Once it didn't respond at all and I had to press the power button to turn the display on. Battery life is the best in this phone compared to the past phones that I have used. With your phone connected to either WiFi or Mobile data all the time and an average use of the phone, it would last for nearly 2 days. Based on my usage, with a 100% charge in the morning before leaving for work, it comes down to around 50% in the evening with it connected to Mobile data the whole time. Overall I am content with it as it is backed by a monstrous battery, immersive AMOLED display, lag free One UI, good camera. The only down side of this product is the fingerprint reader.

Best Performance, awesome photography with many options of Wide Angle, pro mode, Live focus, Super slow motion. Battery takes time to charge approx 2.30hrs but lasts almost 2 days. Do not overcharge night as it does affect discharge of battery performance.
Awesome multi tasking, gaming, browsing and watching over. Does not hang , mild heating can be experienced if heavy user. Overall worth every penny and does satisfy user. Loving the phone and strongly recommend to purchase it. Great Comeback Samsung .
FingerPrint Reader - Very good
Camera Quality - shared few pics captured it's awesome
Battery Life - Best in Industry
Price - Budgetable purchase and worth every penny
Glass- Gorilla
RAM - LPDDR4X
Storage - UFS 2.1

Imagined an amazing phone and built it for Us with no issues. That's M30S to me.

Samsung M30s Front Camera is disappointing. Even after being a 16MP, it does not show sharpness but an image which is like taken from 8MP Camera. I have Compared with Oppo F11 and OnePlus, Front Camera is not good. Rear Camera is not as good as 48MP, it has a night mode but a single camera has a quality for night mode out of tripple, a single camera has a super steady mode for image out of tripple, a single camera has a night mode out of tripple.
Moreover, most of the Camera features seems missing.

Finger Print Sensor is working good and so fast.

Battery is really good as 6000mah, sometimes feel like draining a bit fast and being a big battery, changing takes a bit time even its has a feature for 15w fast charge. Fast charge capasity should be more than 15w.
Yes, battery can take full 2 days to be zero for a normal user.

Touch, brightness, color, screen smoothness, weight, launcher, design... these all are perfect...
However, the phone does not come with Handsfree and back cover is quite disappointing as it has a plastic polymer body and display glass is not a gorilla glass.

Even after all of these its a 50-50 option phone to buy currently.

Nice phn , but after using for two months I can say that some things which , if worked smoothly enough this phn would have broken all the milestones . 1Camera  :  In daylight is excellent bt in low light it's not up to the mark . 2:Fingerprint sensor is also not fast enough . 3: battery is quiet gud gor this gaint phn , lasts up to whole day with moderate use . 4: sometimes hangs A bit and with some heating issue also . 5: ram is working fine as 1.7 GB Left free for all your apps . 6: 55 GB Rom is left after all the pre installed apps ,  which is quite gud and impressive .  OVERALL I'm SATISFIED WHAT I HV GOT . SAMSUNG IS A EXCELLENT BRAND KNOWN FOR IT'S QUALITY PRODUCTS AND THIS PHN IS CARRYING THE SAME LAGACY . GUD CHOICE IF U R A SAMSUNG LOVER .

For the cost, the value that this phone provides is outstanding. To begin with.. it looks great..  very very premium.. Battery life is mindblowing. I use it with dual sim, 3 hours of continuous live streaming while daily comute in the train, plus data on the whole day... and
the battery yet last on a single charge for between 1.5 to 2 days. Camera quality is good and the various modes give great effects  to picture. Screen picture quality is great.. no lag.. and speed is good inspite of multiple apps running..

Only drawback is that the battery charging. It very quickly charges till about 60 to 70 %. From then on to 100% takes almost double the time..

Overall a superbly priced and very well equipped ..

A very elegant branded phone within good price.
The very first thing I like is it's super AMOLED screen with beautiful color reproduction and super smooth touch.
Second is its responsiveness of loading applications and multitasking. Very good.
Third is it's Camera. View and Click. Fast clear pictures from both front and back. It has multiple setting for giving effects to clicked pictures. 48 megapixels whatever is being advertised by all mobile brands including this doesn't means it is reallly 48. Because the camera of all mobiles are about 12 to 16 megapixels and expect same quality. Only thing is the phone should process pics fast and clear. This phone does both. And because of super AMOLED screen, photos comes out very bright in the phone.
Video quilty also good and it has Image stabilization. Also has Super Slow motion which can be found only in high end devices.
Phone doesn't heat and is a very good thing.
Phone build is absolutely good.
Back panel while holding will get lots of finger marks so should have a good case for the phone.

After 5 days of uses:
Camera 5/5
Performances 5/5
Display 5/5
Battery 5/5
Phone look 5/5
User interface 5/5
Sound 5/5
awesome phone

An awesome phone for the price paid. Got it delivered within few hours of placing the order. The M30s has a pretty interesting triple camera set up on the back and the selfie shooter too is decent but the main focus has always been on the 6000 mAh battery which hopefully will last 2 days.

I am very much impressed with Samsung.
P.S. I am testing the camera, battery life and other stuff and I should be able to update this section shortly.

By the way, the Super AMOLED screen is GORGEOUS.

Update: The battery life is really amazing on this phone. Even after playing heavy games for long and watching videos with heavy usage, the battery lasts 2 days.
No lags at all.

Camera is too worst to bad. Amazon team and samsung are deceiving the customers with new launches.Both are losing their credibility..so pls look into . Also that it is not under return and only replacement.  I am fighting for the same now. Highly disappointed  with the mobile and the way amazon deals after sales

This phone is an absolute winner from Samsung. I've previously used Galaxy Note 1 and Galaxy J7 prime. This time also went with Samsung rather than Realme or Redmi &amp; the decision turned out to be good. It's been only a week since I started using this phone and the results are as expected. Everything works awesome. The battery life, UI, Fingerprint reader, Amoled Display, GPS works great. The camera performance is a little low and fingerprint reader's speed is somewhat slow than the other competitors in same price range but that's fine. Samsung did a great job to fit a monster 6000 mah battery in this handset and still the overall weight is just about 188 grams. This phone is best for someone who is a multitasker, The 6 gb /128 gb variant is really worth.

I love to admire  the sapphire blue back case i.e the stylish combination of blue and sea green color.
The triple camera quality is excellent capturing great pictures with awesome quality. ³👌(48mp+5mp+5mp)..getting a phone of great brand of 128gb memory, 68gb ram,48mp camera,6.4 inch screen,good processor at a reasonable cost 17000 is lovely. The phone has 6000mah battery life which can last for a whole day besides heavy usage.
U can enjoy the fast gaming exeperience on this mighty mobile .its extremely easy to carry  as its not heavy and its slim.i just love to recommend this phone to all of you.u will have an amazing experience. it....²This brilliant phone with its wonderful features is exceptional.⅘⁴

Amazing budget phone launched by samsung.

Amazing price ranging and additional price cutoff offered by amazon.

As it is called, yes it is definitely a monster  with monstrous battery of 6000 maH which smoothly up to 30 hours with extrem usage like completely on wifi, 4-6 hours of gaming and 1-2 hours of photography.

Camera, another big thing by Samsung a set of triple rear camera with 48 megapixels  of primary lens, 8 megapixels of ultra wide angle lens, 5 megapixels of live focus or depth lens and 16 megapixels of front camera.

Next on processor, Samsung M30s contains chipset of Samsung exynos 9611, which is an octa core processor surprisingly handles different  type of ram consuming apps.

After reading others comments here i was skeptic about buying this product, but ended up buying it. The phone is amazzzing, i did not found any heating or ram management problem, the display is way too good for this price segment, it feels like u r using a 50k plus phone.
The back panel is plastic but its ok if u r going to use a cover,in my case it doesn't matter.
Till now all good will update aftrr 1 month.

After 2.5 month of usage I will write a review about my Samsung M30 sapphire blue.
First thing very best price after all discount  my phone was 12500 rupees 128gb and 6GB ram with 1year free protection by acko.. I bought this in indian great sale...  so I got this mobile with good deal.
Pros:
1. Good battery for heavy use 1 to 1.5 day it comes. Heating also very less.. main this is weight less mobile for 6000mah battery thanks to samsung

2.No lagging and slow  and 6 GB ram it's very good for this phone..
3.Looks attractive design
4.Camera is 48mp for back  not so good but it's ok for this price.. and more camera feature are there..
overall  phone was good for this price range.
Cons:
1. Camera pixel not 48 mp it's average pixel quality only so pls improve update for cameras quality for this phone model.
2.Some etc feature are not there  which I already used in vivo. Like calling feature and once receiver attend phone we will notify he attended our call. But that is not there  here..
3.recording call option is not easy here.. in vivo  we can see the menu itself.. but here it's not there.
So this are the negative  I have seen in my phone.

As per me this is best phone for this price range from branded company.

Night mode is simply classy.

This phone is beyound expectations in low price.
Always trustworthy in quality.
Samsung and Amazon together.😘

The amoled screen of Samsung M30s is very delicate. It can be broken and the complete phone can be dead on slight drop. AMOLED displays can crack and go completely black after seemingly minor damage, or in some cases, no apparent damage at all.  In comparision to this the LCD screens seem to be able to survive much more serious damage.AMOLED screen tends to go black (so customers have no choice but to pay for a pricey repair) and LCDs tend to still be usable most of the time (so customers can choose to postpone the repair until prices go down and keep using their broken screen with a screen protector on top). I have recently purchased this phone whose screen got completely damaged on slight drop. I have replaced the screen on 01.11.2019 for Rs. 4000/-, and the authorised servicing centre has also charged Rs. 413/- extra towards labour cost even within one month of purchase. Why to charge labour cost in warranty period ?

Likes:
Awesome battery life, I can literally breeze through the day only having charged only once it in the morning.
The phone runs smoothly and fast. Haven't sensed any major concerns in terms of speed, storage or camera; neither faced issues like the heating up.
Fast fingerprint reading. Face recognition isn't the best in low-light, but decent enough during daytime.

Dislikes:
Not sure if this is only the case with me or everyone using this phone but the during the first few seconds of any phone call the person on the other end cannot hear me.
Samsung cameras in general seem to capture photos and adjust them to their best understanding of a fancier output. Isn't the closest to what the eye sees. It isn't that big a concern, but something worth noting.
Does take a little longer to get charged than other phones. It does pay off though.

1.Heating problem while charging and on little bit long usage.
2. Camera picture quality is not upto the mark and does not suit to tripple camera and 48 Mega pixel feature.
3. Network reception is also poor fluctuates frequently.
4. Screenshare session does not allow screen on monile whereas it should happen on both.
5. Proximate sensor not effective enough.

Very nice dashing phone, slim, handy, awsm display, perfect look. If i want to talk about batry just ignore it, its the only thing that samsung have not compromise for this product, samsung have smash it. But the camera quality is not as 48mp. For text on board at a distance of 15 to 20 feet is not showing sharp edges i.e the edge detection is not so sharp, that is the only thing that i feel about camera is not good Otherwise picture quality is very good,video stabalisation is great, slow motion videos geting awsm.
So many other features which are very awsm and usefull  are given like vivid display, night mode, power saving mode, game booster etc.
Samsung have realy done a great work on this product.
If camera is not your frist preference then definiately buy this dashing phone.
Every thing is perfect and awsm.

The best part is the phone's screen quality.
Fringerprint is sometimes bit slow, camera and build quality is average but battery backup is very good.
 Samsung should have priced this at 11k range considering the competitors.

I have been using this device for last week. It is really very handy and slim. It really looks awesome and the screen quality is superb. It's battery life life is outstanding and lasts around two days of normal usage. Audio is loud enough and the interface is seamless. Overall great value for money. I think it is excellent for students also who perform lot of functions and watch study videos. One word of caution: Since it is a new launch, please purchase back cover, tempered glass etc., with caution as there are only few options right now.

It features a new style triple-camera module and new color options. The back is still made of glossy plastic, and it attracts fingerprints/ smudges easily. Having said that, Samsung has done a good job in keeping the weight down (188 grams) despite a massive 6,000mAh battery.
Coming to the display, there is no change in the M30s' 6.4-inch Super AMOLED panel. It still looks nice and offers full-HD+ (1080 x 2340 pixels) resolution with Infinity U notch. I had no problem with its touch performance, brightness levels, sunlight legibility and viewing angles.
Battery lasted for me for 1.5 days for my daily use.
Both cameras performed over an average for its price and competition. In the daylight condition, the rear camera does outshines with the 48-megapixel lens. Also, the wide-angle camera does a good job. 
The Galaxy M30s works well in handling day-to-day tasks.

It's worth of buying considering amount paid. Switched from Redmi 3s so mobile looks bigger in size but best part is phone is lightweight!!
Used 2 hours of hotspot &amp; witnessed only 4% battery drop. Wow!!
As usual Amazon maintains packaging standards 👍

For the price, this is a good phone. I bought this about a month back. I am a reasonably heavy user, and here are some of my observations so far.

a. The battery is good, and  comes to little more than a day of reasonably heavy usage. It is more than par for this price range
b. The camera quality is decent. It won't compare to the higher quality of the comparable A series which despite lesser specs shoot better. But overall, camera options are good if there is enough lighting. Performance in poor lighting is not great
c. Call quality and speakers are average. They are not loud enough. I dont know yet if that is a device issue or a model issue
d. The phone is sleek, and display is good. You will need a good case to get a secure grip. The back of the phone has smudges if you dont use the case
e. The phone doesn't have an auto brightness sensor. It instead uses the front camera to sense ambient lighting. So that drains the battery life a little bit more than phones with sensors
f. The GPS sensors are good and phone compass is accurate
g. Processing speed is good. I did not get any lag despite keeping and using multiple apps open

A very good package for the price.
Display -&gt; I am highly satisfied with it's screen quality. It has sAmoled display which is a treat to watch.
Battery -&gt; Biggest feature of this phone, it's 6000mAh battery is a beast and easily provides 1.5 to 2 days of battery backup with moderate to heavy usage.
Performance -&gt; Though this phone is not a gaming centric device, it performs quite well in this domain also with exynos 9611 chipset. I haven't noticed any lag during the gameplay of COD and Asphalt 9. PubG on high settings is running smoothly without any noticeable frame drop.
Camera -&gt; This phone features a 48 megapixel primary camera which is good for normal photography. But image quality doesn't seem to be pop out at first sight. This camera part needs high amount of optimization from software team.
Fingerprint reader is snappy and performs as expected. Samsung's One UI is lightweight and provides smoother user experience.

Network coverage is low in this device when compared to Realmi,Redmi or even Samsung's other model. Low internet speed as well.

This phone has virtual light sensor which uses front camera regularly hence 7-10% battery is drained by this kind of implementation only it's a very bad tactic of cost cutting from Samsung. End of the day performance is like that of 4000 mah battery.

Screen quality is good and weight is also not much.
Several features cut in One UI like secure folder, support for Arcore etc. Go for A50s

This phone is a good one at this price range. It have few very small issues. Wide angle pics has a little deformation which can be fixed buy updates, and also live focus can be improved mainly in the frount cam. Fingerprint sensor is fine. On the lock screen we get phone option on the left and camera optuon on the right, i prefer flash light option on the left, i tried to change it in the settings but found that only apps can be set. Even this can be changed byt updates. It has an very good game booster feature which is perfect for gaming. Over all i rate it 8 out of 10 for its performance and all. But when it comes to built quality samsung haven't mentioned about its screen protection, i would prefer atleast gorilla glass 3 and plastic body is just fine but i suggest a case for pearl white colour. Im really impressed by its weight the phone dosen't weight like it has a 6000 mah battery, its really a plus for this phone for built quality i rate it 8 out of 10. Over all its the best phone at this price range.

Phone heats up quickly and the plastic body had a defect. The edges are bulging and making sound when held with tight grip. I tried to replace but amazon service said that every body is facing the same issue. I want to ask why I'm being the suferer. I want a proper piece or take the phone back. Why I am being asked to contact samsung for this when seller is giving me a defective piece. I dint expect this from amazon atleast after being a prime customer.

Originally smitten by its battery numbers, since, being a heavy user, it has always been an impediment, I find this phone absolutely worth every penny. It is blazing fast (though I am not much of a gamer), the Super Amoled display is simply the best and the Samsung OneUI very intuitive and classy.
Highlights:
1. Fast charging - check
2. Battery performance - best (though it has only been 2 months so far)
3. UI - best in its class
4. Camera - decent
5. Fingerprint sensor - decent
6. Face recognition - decent

Lowlights:
There are number of useless apps that are pre-loaded, which if you don't use, would simply sit there and eat your RAM. Best get rid of them. Not necessarily a lowlight per se, since this is not stock Android but still.

Verdict : Best phone in this range.. can beat others in the higher range.

Battery life:
Around 30% remaining after 1 day full usage with mixture of video watching, games, phone call, camera photos &amp; videos.
Full movie watching with 2h 30 min in half brightness and full speaker volume consumes 12-15 % battery charge.  So I assume that I can watch 6 movies from 100% to 10%.
Camera:  Good clarity in night mode; Camera videos looks like professional camera.
Screen: Four corner in screen has curved edges and looks theatrical screen during movie watching in crop mode.
Display:  Colorful screen in M30s Amoled during video watching compare to other LCD screen (looks pale/dim)
Phone speed: Almost all apps has very fast opening &amp; usage.

The Samsung m30s is a good phone to buy. I like the phone as it has no lags, good battery life, good camera picture quality, lot of space to store user data and photos . It has a responsive fingerprint scanner for users using it for general phone use. It is almost all of the things I liked what I looked during selection was cost. was, a simultaneous dual LTE, unlike the older phones that I had that would allow LTE/Volte on only sim only.  I would have also loved to see Stock Android in the phone I buy. The  stock android interface with all the oneui enhancements  would have been a welcome change,  as I have used the pixel android  launcher. The phone orverall is a great buy.  I would have liked to see Dolby ATMOS in it.

If you are looking for a device that can "PLAY" media then this is the device for you and you will love it. But, if you are someone who is looking for things like 4G connectivity every time or camera results without artificially enhanced, and good battery life[yes 6000 MAH battery still I am saying it] then this is not the device for you. In my office, my Intex Aqua 4G gives me 4G network completely as compared to this Samsung M30s which officially sucks! I mean that old phone I have to use as a hotspot to enjoy good internet on this 2019 phone. I hate it. And then there is a camera which enhances the photo artificially and not via lense to know what I am talking about zoom into the photos and you will see.

This product could have been much more than a disappointment at these important places.

No hard feelings for Samsung it's just I know what Samsung is capable off and I know they can do better then this.

Value for money is a great thing to expect from samsung as we already know samsung more often concerntrates on quality with high pricing. But with m30s samsung has broken th e records, more like the j series lineup samsung has concerntrated the key feature and given them a shape so that people can compare the device with its competitors smoothly. But still as it is called samsung,you will have to compromise with places ,like finger print reader is nit awesome but it is not bad either, it is okay. It does'nt recognise fingerprints a in a hurry, you have to have patience and so is the camera, in day light, you can say it is kinda monster,but in night,it will perform somewhere around average. The only thing you can rely on with each and every aspect is the hige 6000 mah battery that lasts long even with heavy usage.

Device is more than expected camera performance is excellent for homely use battery is 52% by night 10pm and if you charge for an Hr it will be around 85% it is taking two and half hrs for 100% now I have relieved  my self from continuous charging problem carrying powerbank always .s amoled screen is better lot of features are there which we need to explore and use .overall after 10 days of use I am satisfied with the performance .only con I have found is adaptable screen light is not up to the mark .samsung please correct it .sound is excellent you don't need an external speakers. If you connect ear phones  Dolby atmos is mind blowing feels like you are sitting in theater. But songs must me latest ones.overall it a worth buy at this price .

What I say is Samsung's already wined the race and become 10 step ahead from competitors after launching  this mobile.

By far I found over all quality excellent Dispaly and touch quality also very good. Battery  still performing very but long run evaluations  are required  for proper feedbacks. I found little heating  issue when I updated app from google, now days it's not  arising Over all quality  of the handset  is good. Till now it's performing  above expectations.  My earlier  mobile was MIA1 &amp; that has a heating problem, if u talk it will be heated up in no time. But M30s doesn't have such problems.  I found my choices  far better than MiA1.
More over after exchange and other discounts I purchase it around 12k. And I found it's over all quality is best far better than other manufacturers.

Pros:-
-------
Display is good.
Touchscreen sensitivity is good.
Apps are working fine without any issue.
Till now I haven't noticed phone getting hot with full day extensive usage.
Fingerprint reader works fine.
Camera quality is good in this price range. It has pro mode, so those who knows these stuffs can do better.
AR emoji works fine.
Has NFC &amp; Samsung pay, both works fine.
Don't have indicator led but against that it gives you a minor vibration when you pick it up as an indicator that there are some notifications for you to look at.

Cons:-
--------
Little bit larger for one hand operation.
May find it little bit heavier.
Don't have real time internet speeds display option.

Overall this is a value for money phone.

First impressions: the phone seems pretty impressive.
Appearance :9/10 opal black looks phenomenal
Weight : 9/10 - very light for a 6000mah battery
Touch sensitivity : 7/10
The gestures feature after u turn off the navigation bar is not very receptive. I ended up using the navigay bar instead.
Fingerprint scanner : 4/10 - pretty disappointed with this. I was using a Lenovo phone prior to this and I would rate that scanner 9/10. You can add only 3 gunners and the reception isn't very good in the m30s
Camera:8/10
I haven't done any gaming on this phone, hence can't comment on heating issues. Without that, I haven't had any issues thus far over the last one week of using the m30s
Speakers : 7/10 there's only one external speaker on the right bottom. Not the best of speakers. But to y early to tell for it fares. Hoping it survives a year at least.
Overall, Pretty satisfied with this phone and would probably recommend it over the other current redmi models

I write this review after using for 1 month and phone is TRUE "value for money" in its generation. I did not see issues as of now, I am using Sapphire Blue, 4GB RAM, Super AMOLED Display, 64GB Storage, 6000mAH Battery which I got for under 12500/- after bank offer...

M30s is really a monster. From it's impeccable battery to awesome screen ,it's a surprise bomb of Samsung.
Merits-
*AMOLED display -  great personal experience , from Pubg graphics to Netflix binge watching
*Great performance- processor is great ,no game lag issues.
*Great look- rare camera setting gives it a classic look. However I will recommend black one over pearl white
With all this we get brand name of Samsung in just 13999...did I just missed 6000mah...you know it already
Cons-
*Biometric is not that fast responding
*the black border around screen in pearl white version doesn't go well.(not with other variants)
Average-
*Camera is nice. Gives competition to every camera phone with excellent bright light photos. However in artificial light background blur and detailing gets affected.
Have fun....🙂🙂

Pros:
-Smooth UI without any stuck-up or slowness while navigating
-Battery backup very good . It will last for 2 days for any normal usage involving social media, browsing etc I haven't tried paying games.
-Camera is good in daylight
-Attractive Design
- Battery charging took around 1 hr 50 min from 20%

Cons:
-I looked for phones with low SAR . M30S had a low Head SAR around 0.46W/kg but couldn't find Body SAR values even in official website.

However usage wise I haven't faced any problem with the phone for past one week. will update once using for another few weeks.

Using it for nearly two months
Battery backup is good but phone gets stuck little bit when doing multitask...

I've been using mine for about a month now. And i feel like it's a good package for the money overall. Mines the 6gb, 128gb variant.
Performance is quite good overall. But youllsee some major hiccups when it comes to a heavy multitasking. Gaming on this phone is quite satisfactory. I tested cod mobile and it runs quite smoothly on mid graphics and without much thermal lag over long periods of gaming
Well the battery and screen is what we're all her for. And they perform as advertised. Battery is quite impressive as of yet what with a 6000mah battery
Screen is vibrant. Clear outdoors. A bit over saturated owing to the Samsung panel.
The weak point of this phone is the camera. Provide it with enough light and you'll get some decent shots. The 48 mp gives the resolution. But nighttime photos are just bad. Very grainy washed out amd night mode doesn't do it any favours

Posting a review after 5 days of rigorous use..
Pros:- Actually every spec is superb of this phone but to be precised here are the details..
1. Monstrous battery life of 6000mah battery. I have charged this device only twice since i got it.
2. Can't get better display in this price range. If you lyk watching videos a lot lyk me then you'll fall in love with it.
3. Breathtaking camera quality.
4. Processor. No lags at all.
The list can go on and on and on..i want to give 4.5* rating but don't have the option of 1/2*. So now here are some points why i want to cut that 1/2*..
Cons:-
1. No notification indicator light.
2. You don't get a Flash Charger with it. But you do get a Fast Charger so i guess that's manageable.
3. No screen guard/tempered glass is provided with the box.
4. No back cover is provided.
Overall Verdict:-
Don't even think while buying it. You will not get a brand like Samsung with these specs in this price range. Go for it.

I am surpirsed with how wide the wide angle camera is, it is a plus for sure. The camera is good when u consider the price of this phone. The battery is the reason why i bought this phone, and it does not disappoint. It will easily last for 2 days, not even joking, it will !!. Overall a great budget phone for sure. Love it

So i have been using this phone as my primary device for a week now. First of all, kudos to amazon for excellent delivery. Coming to the phone itself, it is a prime device at the 17k budget. Samsung's quality assurance and hugh grade materials make this phone a complete package. The battery as claimed is mammoth. It easily lasts for 1.5 days on heavy usage. I played a 3 hr. movie with several apps running in the background and it just lost 6 percent battery, so you can expect the brilliance here. Sound output is decent via the speaker and sound output via headphone jack or Bluetooth streaming is top notch as it comes with dolby atmos. The user interface is actually very clean and as i come from oneplus, i know what a clean interface means. The fingerprint reader is super quick, but the face recognition is a bit slower for my liking. A sweet touch is that, the ring around the front cam lightens while the phone recognises your face, which comes straight from galaxy S10s and S10 plus. Camera has faired decently with good quality pictures in well lit scenes. Portrait also works fine. Video quality is acceptable for the price. Front camera is decent enough for selfies. The screen as expected is pitch black and satisfies every bit of me with the colours and outdoor visibility is also quite great. Overall, it is highly recommended for those who are on a budget and looking for a great phone around 15-18k. I have been using a 6gb-128gb variant. It is good for gaming as well. PUBG mobile and Asphalt runs super smooth with occasional gitters which are probably the bugs of the game. Quite satisfied with the product. Also, it takes almost 2.5 hrs to charge this phone via the charger provided. This is acceptable regarding the battery size and the output it gives. A single charge is good to go. Hope it helps you to make your buying decision.

This phone is amazing if you opt to choose a smartphone under 15k. The camera quality of the phone is way to good than what I expected, if I talk about the battery life it is a beast, 2.5 days backup on usual basis such as attending phone calls and WhatsApp whereas if you are a heavy user still the phone doesn't force you to the charger before 10 at night. Weight balance of the phone is awesome. It gives you 10 hours of pubg play. Even you can run pubg at 60fps which is awesome for gamers.
If i talk about the display the specs are already mentioned but let me tell you no phone in this range gives you this quality of display, if you want to check please open you tube search any content on 1080p 60fps hdr10 and view it in full brightness at full screen you will get to know...!!
The phone never heats up even after playing pubg for more than 6 hours...!!
Samsung one UI is the best, which gives you seamless performance .
It even gives you dual account feature for WhatsApp and Facebook as in you can use two WhatsApp account on one phone. The phone is easy to handle and feels slim in hands it also gives you a premium feeling in your hand.
Talking about its geekbench score it gives you 347 on single core and 1250 on dual core.
Fingerprint reader is not that good sometimes it doesn't even recognize my I'd and is very slow, face unlock is good but is quite slow. If you run the camera in 48MP it is no shocking that the camera will fail to shoot photo sometimes but when it will make through the photos are very amazing.
You got to see 4k recording at 24fps  on the rear camera which puts on a weight of 1.97GB of storage on a 10 min video recording at 4k...!!

Phone design is sharp and smooth , even it have 6000mAh battery it appears like a normal phone and it do have light weight which is easy to handle and operate.
Camera is good as per its price range it works to the fullest both front and back gives its 100% it never comprises in taking beautiful and colorful shots speacially the scene optimizer gives the pics another high approach which automatically enhance the colors and adjust the light content to that level in which it looks just amazing.

Now comes to the screen quality as we all know that Samsung is known for its super amoled display which is best in the class and in this class there is no comparison of its screen quality.

Games which are heavy like PUBG and Asphalt 9 runs smooth and I am satisfied by its performance.
So a device which gives you more in your budget is nothing a goldmine or you can say is the best phone within your limits which have a capability of giving a awesome experience which an individual feels by operating luxuries phones.

Without any judgememts get it and enjoy its infinite feartures and performance.

Product  is awesome but there are two problems. FIRST is mic noise cancellation  is not that good, so you have to speak loudly.
And back panel color is fading just on first drop....

Battery 1,
Camera 1,
Performance 1,
Noise Cancellation 0, ❌

Actually I am iPhone user, this mobile brought to my wife.
1.Display is bigger enough for all the purpose, not impressive one
2. Speed quite OK
3. Camera doesn’t perform like 48 MP, poor colour image, with 48 MP camera gives your around 25MB for each photo that quickly exhaust your memory.
4. The biggest positive is 6000 mah battery performed well, it can easily give 2 days
5. And the speaker of my handset stopped working after 15 days.... speaker has replaced in Samsung service centre.

Worst product with cheap quality of plastic material once you drop it you have to buy a new one because Samsung repair cost is almost near to it's original price. The back is so worst. You must buy realme Xt apart from buying this phone.

After an Month of usage

 Biggest talking point of this phone- Battery- Last bit more then a day with less or modrate usage. Other phone with less Mah Battery Last more then this. Battery starting to drain very fast after a month of usage. Battery was the biggest factor to buy this phone but i am Truly Disappointed.

Camera- Camera Suck for an 48 mp camera. I don't know why they even say 48MP. Camera quality is way below 48MP.
and when you try to take picture in 48MP mode. its take approx 3 sec to save and picture. Night mode is poor.

Screen - Best part of this phone is beautiful Screen.

1.0 out of 5 stars

If you are looking for a phone that can survive regular day usage(or rather days of usage) with bang for your bucks then go for it.

If you are a gamer,camera enthusiast or a developer stay away from the phone. Trust me the camera is horrible in this device.There are other phones in market that has better camera (POCO without a second thought).

Samsung has done a lot of cost cutting in this device by not using ambient/IR sensors. The calls use front facing camera which pretty much does its job most of the time. Face unlock is crap on the device where as fingerprint is fluid to response.

Build quality is poor and would definitely need insurance, back cover and a screen guard. If you hate these 3 then don't use this at all.

Overall the phone is kind of Baleno which is feature rich inside and a crap from outside.

Pros:-
1. 6000mAH  battery will run throughout the day even with heavy usage (not high spec games )
2. OneUI 2 is awesome. Got updated to Android 10 too.
3. Oled Display is awesome. This is the best thing about the phone.
Cons:-
1. Front Camera is rubbish as hell.
2. Back Camera takes decent pictures but not satisfied with the post-processing that Samsung does on the images.
3. Indian Version won't have Snapdragon. It will be an Exynos Processor. The pitfall of Exynos Processor - No GCam available as of now ie No modifications can be done at the camera API level as of now.
4. The camera does not allow to control the shutter speed.

Why I am so obsessed with bad camera performance?
I currently use a Moto X4 (Dual camera 13 MP- main and 8 mp wide-angle) that performs much much better than M30s.

amazing  phone with a massive  battery  of 6000 mah
this phone is not so heavy even it has massive battery
body design is plastic  not that good but the gradient  effects makes it bit wiser so no prolem with that

it is fast charging  so no need to wait long to get it charged
display  is samoled which is superb  the colors shown on the screen is so realistic
and this phone is only sold by amazon, where no  one selling even in offline market
so be a part of amazon to buy this amazing phone

A great decision, in fact a great choice among the comparable sets under sub 20K price. You ask for the features and you get them!
Superb battery life which is so important in India as we tend to use a phone longer in one charge over calling, music day long, and social networking sites. 6K mah battery makes it bit heavier phone but worth the utility.
Camera is another joy with 48MP core camera and even the selfie taken was attractive. Clear images even in low light, and with all required image modes option. You will enjoy the clicks!
Finger print reader is tad slow but still at par with other Galaxy phones from samsung.
Processor upgraded and absolutely a experience. I took 128 GB and 6 GB variant, and will suggest all to go for it for just a minor price pinch.
M30s truly lives upto its marketing statement - a monster in performance. It won't disappoint you. Go for it and flaunt your choice.

The fake 48 magazine pixel cam

Battery okay us only provided charger

Others will not work and give u stand by.

Tinger prints it's too delay have to fully cover the phone then only it will work else it won't

The tap to wake the screen is not working

Cvtype to audio Jake output is not supported.

Size okay weight also okay

But the Samsung reduced the quality of the phones as the reduced the prize range

Battery works for 3 days if u r not using much

If u use internet cintinuously then 1 and 3/4  will be there

And the pixels are not much like expected  when h see the 48 mp photo.u cant zoom it much after a shot.

New Samsung galaxy m30s. 6.4-inch big screen with curved edges and the dual tone-colored backside is awesome. I brought a black and purple in color. It has given a super design with a very thin and a suitable width for safe handling. But I will More happy if they keep the same width, thickness, and less height .because I like small mobile. But it's ok.

No specialty in-camera style and fingerprint scanner usual style only.

The screen quality is stunning outstanding. we can see the power of AMOLED for the first look in the screen.. it is color full and feels like 4k clarity. I fell in love with the screen at first sight. it was preloaded with many apps that we can uninstall if not necessary. Another awesome feature is the 48mp triple camera. I am, not a professional cameraman, but Honestly, I'm not impressed in the main camera.. but the night mode pictures and depth mode pictures are terrific. Wide-angle camera performance also very satisfactory .. another marvelous feature is 4k video cam and super steady video camera.. it will blow our mind. One negative I found in that is no steady option given in 4k video record.

 

And battery nothing to say, is a 6000 mah monster battery. After I charge 100 percentage 16+ hours of a continuous run to the next charge. In which include 4+GB of downloads in Wi-Fi . 2 + house of PUBG play. More than 50 images in-camera, 4 hrs. of music play in Bluetooth speaker. And full-time data was on during this 16 hr. The overall battery performance is good.

And another super performance in this is face reorganization and fingerprint scanner. No words to explain..  great speed of face detection .. below half of 1 sec for lock screen opening by biometric scanners .even in night face recognize giving satisfactory performance  We never feel that phone is locked, because very fast  face detection open lock ofsometime rarely it is taking up to 3 sec in the night for face reorganization.

One of the negative in this is the Split screen option is not provided. Even in the old model, Samsung has this

.now days all smart mobile is coming with mirror cast option that is missing in this. But all over it is a sensational mobile

I would like to suggest this mobile to all of you if you are not consider the negative that I explain above.

And I am giving 4.8 stars out of 5

Before m30s my last bought phone was Samsung Galaxy m30 and now I choose m30s as earlier my eyes on a50s but I go with my budget  and trust me this phone m30s is killer one...
I choose Samsung for its display quality and touch and yes the brand image as I don't like chinese brands.

So here is review of m30s as per me.
1.This phone camera is good not excellent like 48m bcz of not a good aperture used m30 is good in this case even having low mp.
2.battery yes its really a monster 6000mah one I am heavy user and I am fully satisfied.
3.feel and colour is awesome touch quality,  and the display everything smooth.
4.my phone is not faced yet any heating issue .
fingerprint reader is better than m30.
Overall a good upgrade to m30 and Samsung really doing new in the market now days.

I am totally happy and satisfied with good processor and other specs.
Thanks Samsung and yes Amazon.

It's an amazing phone that too at this price point. The product has never given me a reason to complain about anything
1. Battery - Pretty solid battery back up is offered by this phone. I'm quite a heavy user and it includes
Shuffling among different applications,  my data is always on , gaming, hours of direction on the Google maps, clicking pictures,  shooting videos and pretty much everything a phone can do. Still it offers a day long battery life plus a bit more comfortably
2. Display- there's nothing to say about it's display anything will be an understatement at this price point what Samsung has to offer
3. Camera - The Camera is outstanding be it on clarity , or the options in the manual modd are enough for someone with skills to click breathtaking snaps.
My favourite feature is the Ultra Wide Angles on both the front and rear. You can literally fit in almost everything that you see.
4. The processor performs quite good and there is very little to no lags while using multiple applications simultaneously. The M30s seamlessly handles everything without much sweat. It doesn't heat up at all.
5. The only thing that is mediocre on this phone is it's plastic build but it still feels premium and solid. It should be used aided with a back cover or a flip one along with a Tempered Glass protection.
One should carefully handle this phone and avoid dropping it from anywhere above waist height.
And always keep the screen of the phone facing your thighs while carrying it in the pocket.
Me and my friend both got this phone together , his is a sapphire blue coloured one.
To sum it up it's not only a smart and a great deal at 16999 but rather it's steal.
I'm very happy with this product and would recommend it. Kudos to Samsung for offering such an amazing device

This one really worth buying...the build quality is not as premium as glass built eventhough its plastic  but the quality is really good...Camera is fast and capture excellent images in both indore and outdoor conditions and one of the best thing is videos those are really awesome I jst love it...selfies are also comes good and colors seems natural not over saturated...display is really awesome and you will enjoy viewing anything on this...performance is also very fluid didn't notice any lag and it can able to handle many things easily thanks to 6gb ram...boot time is about half a minute...coming to one of the best thing on this mobile battery...it takes 2 hours and few minutes to get fully charged...once it get charged it will easily go for 1.5 to 2 days in normal usage...I usually get 15% remaing in the next day evening...in intensive and continuous usage and 1.5 hours of gaming in an average it lasted for 1 day and 4 hrs left with some juice for the next day morning...over 1 month of usage in felt this is one of the best mobile you can get for the price...still it needs some more improvements in camera and battery departments...this one uses the latest process it seems if it get somemore optimization in next updates then this one will beat everything else in battery because even it having 6000mah battery it feels like a 5000mah only...and I think rear camera sensor is also seems more capable than what its seems now...because it's a new gen one and if it get somemore tweaks then it can produces more stable and good looking images in night time also because in night times the images comes with little grains in it...security updates are properly come I think now samsung concentrate on providing hopes to ite users...overall it's really fantastic and hope Samsung will bring more fun into this in future updates.

Samsung M30s will be the game changer in budget segment phone market.
Amazing display, no comparison with other chinese brands and can compare with samsung flagship devices.
Camera decent not too good but considering price it's more than perfect. Crisp,sharp pictures. Colour adjustment awesome. Focus deadly fast. Only thing is you have to wait steady for nearly 5 seconds after taking photo in 48 mp. It's taking time to save. May be a software update can fix that.
Call quality, network, ram management, sound etc everything works pretty good. No heating issue as such.
Face unlock and fingerprint sensor works well. Not lightening fast but fast.
And last but not the list 6000 mah. It's really a monster. Not to worry about charge for atleast 2 days after full charge.
Regarding build quality it's not very good. But if we use a back cover and a protective screen guard then we should not be worried about build quality.

Purchased the phone in prime only access on 28th. Sep. and received on 30th. Thanks Amazon for fast delivery and Thanks Samsung for such a powerful device in this budget.

t's basically impossible to make a wrong choice when shopping for a smartphone these days. Pretty much every phone you buy will deliver stellar performance and a full day of battery life between charges.But of course, the best phone will differ depending on what features are most important to you be it a amoled display, a great camera,long lasting 6000mah battery and top-notch with dolby atmos.

Hey consumers, hope u people find this review useful fr analyzing all aspects beforehand, before taking the buying decision. Here is the review of M30s after 12+ days of extensive use.

The biggest 7 pros where it completely dominates are
1) monstrous battery and the backup it provides,
2) sAmoled screens stunning FHD+ display which provides d best viewing experience,
3) ONE UI - the best and smooth user interface,
4) 15W fast charger which unlikely being in the cons list of many as per me decently charges the 6000 mah juice in just 2.5 hours. To add here I would like to definitely put forth that the power mode or the battery saver mode the cell provides can run d cell approx 8 hours wit jus 12% charge, ofcourse here there would b some restrictions but a pro for sure,
 5) the compactness and lightweight even after housing 6000 mah battery n the ease in one hand operation even after housing 6.4" screen is really admirable and applaudable,
6) Dolby Atmos support which makes the audio quality to die for and
7) the customer service the brand provides. I hav personally raised a issue with the online customer care and the help received is appreciable.

Having said that other pros to list are
1) the camera and video modes it provides but slightly disappointing is the quality of the camera to some extent,
2) the gradient design (i am a fan of sapphire blue),
3) the build quality without any click crack sounds when u press it as some reviewers has stated,
4) fast finger print sensor at the back end,
5) the fast 9611 processor and mali GPU it houses does the job accurately even for the hours of gaming and
6) the speaker quality is also gud and is loud.

The only 2 cons which I faced with this cell is that firstly it heats up near the ear piece or the mother board section of the cell during me being on call. But the issue is solved to a great extent or I would say it's the use to ness which makes it unnoticeable after few days usage. Secondly at this point of time when inscreen fingerprint sensor is in trend it still houses fingerprint sensor at the backend.

Also I would like to mention here that snapdragons processor or exynos 9611,  you as a consumer won't face any issues as me because the limit to which we would use cell is much low than the limits of the hardwares capacity. So in my opinion the high end tech. like d antutu scores n other respectives hav no much importance to me as a common consumer. Also this is my personal view.

Overall I would definitely say that u can get other gud cells in terms of camera, snapdragon processor, andreno GPU etc but this cell would be a best buy which u won't regret.

At last it's your requirement, needs and likes which u go for as all people, reviewers, users etc. will have view of their own. To put it more accurately I would say that some appreciate the use of gorilla glass at front and back end which feels premium and adds protection to the cell but when it comes to me I would say we all know the pain through which we hav to go when the cell falls and the glass breaks. Even more when we have to put in more money to buy d glass and get the cell back on track and going.

Now with this i would like to leave it upto you whether to go fr the might of a brand like SAMSUNG compromising on few which too the brand has provided substitutes for and managed very well or to go for something new fr the many in trend.

Kudos to SAMSUNG for coming up wit a MONSTER in the budget segment with a MONSTOROUS PERFORNANCE ofcourse.

The Samsung M30s has a pretty interesting triple camera set up on the back and the selfie shooter too is decent but the main focus has always been on the 6000 mAh battery. I got a 10% discount on my SBI credit card and in addition to that I received Rs 1,000 cashback as Amazon Pay.  I am very much impressed with Samsung.

The battery life is really amazing on this phone. Even after playing heavy games for long and watching videos with heavy usage, the battery lasts 2 days.

I’ve ordered Sapphire Blue mobile, which looks quite good with the color changing from blue to turquoise. At the rear, there’s also a hard-to-miss triple camera module. Unlike the single strip in its predecessor, the handset has three shooters vertically with a flash unit alongside, which looks unsightly, if I may say so. It’s worth mentioning that Samsung has opted for a polycarbonate back which isn’t as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid. Additionally, it helps the brand in keeping the phone’s weight in check. Speaking of that, it’s impressive that Samsung has been able to pack a monster 6,000mAh cell inside without increasing the bulk (188g) or thickness (8.9mm).

The fingerprint sensor is positioned well, and your finger rests on the scanner easily and unlocks the phone quickly.
Consuming multimedia on the Galaxy M30s is a joyous affair, all thanks to 6.4-inch Super AMOLED panel. The screen is sharp, offers ample brightness levels with good colours. Since it uses AMOLED tech, you also get always-on Display capability.

The monstrous battery capacity of 6,000mAh, and the Samsung Galaxy M30s clearly ranks among the top choices in the sub-Rs 15k segment.

Pros:
• Astounding battery life
• Packs a massive cell without being bulky or unwieldy
• Great shooting capabilities
• Smooth performance
• Immersive Super AMOLED display
• Outdoor display brightness
• Battery is bigger enough to be compared with a battery of MacBook Pro,
• Phone is lightweight as 188gm while holding a bigger battery with capacity of 6000mAh,
• Triple camera setup includes a 48mp Samsung GM1 sensor, an 8mp ultra wide angle lens and a 5mp depth. Front
  camera is also 16mp,
• Super Steady mode is impressive. It can record 4K videos, Super Slow-Mo and Hyper lapse,
• Type-C port along with a 3.5mm headphone jack provided,
• Exynos 9611 octa-core chipset based on a 10nm process. Performance is smooth and competent for playing
  games because Exynos 9611 is better than the Snapdragon 665 as per my experience.

Cons:
Night mode could’ve been better

This honest review is in comparison to the value vs money of this phone.
The performance of the phone is awesome. Though in various reviews I came to know that the processor will be slow than snapdragon processors, I feel no difference for my day to day usage from the earlier snapdragon models I have used.
The finger print sensor is real fast in recognizing. The face unlock is quick and really helpful.
 The camera quality is amazing and more than worth than what we pay for this phone. You can see the attached photos which are amazing according to me.
No issues regarding catching the network signals.
Coming to the battery, its lasting around one and half day minimum for my usage which is quite great. I am not carrying my heavy power bank now which I used to do earlier.
Though the built is not metallic, it is not a problem for me as a strong case I have purchased which keeps my mobile very safe. Even if metallic built, we still use hard cases and therefore the weight will be more, which is not the case here.
The Size of mobile is also fine as I can easily keep in pant pocket, which earlier I thought it would be a problem.
The sound quality is decent and more than sufficient. The sound when using my JBL earphones is amazing as the Dolby effect is given.
Only issue I have is the back of mobile gets vibrated at the time of ringing when calling someone which looks little odd for me.
The device care option is good and need only install separate apps for that purpose.
The black light in night mode option is really helpful for me when using mobile in night and the blue tooth filter option is also good. My eyes don't get strained too easily now as earlier it used to be.
The notification light is not great adsense as the option of always on display is provided.
The ram function is good and mobile is able to handle multiple applications easily.
I am not a regular gamer but I have played asphalt 8 for couple of hours and the mobile did not heat up while playing it.
 The security updates are done once and asked for quick scan which was good reminder.
Another factor to buy this mobile is its  low SAR value compared to other phones in this range.
 You can definitely go for this mobile than the other mobiles since it's good in every aspect.

Overall I would say that this mobile is more than value for money and is a great buy...😍

The phone looks nice and has a super amoled big ass screen. It is a bit bulky as it holds a 6000 mah battery and you can really feel it when you hold it. Nothing to complain to be honest, the 64 GB storage is more than enough for me. Camera quality is surprisingly good as I was not expecting it from Samsung at this price point. Battery lasts around 50% at the end of the day with normal usage and with wi-fi on continuously. People who hate big screen and bulky phones should stay away.

5 outta 5 would be less to give. So battery life will never disppoint you during ur long travel shedules. Camera will turn you in a photographer with sinple clicks. Image stabilization is superb and image quality is equivalent to a DSLR photoshoot. Wide range of options between shooting modes and a floating shutter button provides ease while handling phone during selfies/groupfies..
Without an earphone, but m sure you would use bluetooth handfree to remain tanglefree.. the price range and the quality is unmatched deliverable, which Samsung has made into reality.. without making a hole in your pocket, you are upgrading to the best in class tech specs..
Add Samsung 42/46 mm smartwatch or Samsung Active watch to add to your style...

This is practically the best worth the price smart phone you can get out there. The colour gradient is beautiful and the user interface is really good too. The calculator and the gallery are pretty smart. The camera features include slow-motion video, group selfie and a broader picture range. The only few things I didn't find likable about this phone include the earphone port at the bottom, which is really inconvenient if you like to listen to music while travelling or working. Also the swipe screenshot is not really that useful if you choose not use the buttons to click a screenshot. But all in all this phone is worthy of being called smart and deserves 5 stars.

Every thing is amazing in the phone. But two areas of improvement are suggested which I miss when comparing this from my previous MI phone.
First, the area of finger print reader is proportionately small, so most of the times it asks to cover the whole area. Hence one has to try twice or thrice to unlock the phone. Secondly, there is no schedule power on off function in the Android OS  through which I can schedule my phone to automatically off an on by setting the time. Dear Samsung thanks for the wonderful phone at this price, but do improve these two shortcomings in future. Best wishes.

Cons :
• Missing :  App lock, screen recorder, Screenshot icon in menu bar, internet speed meter etc.
• 48 MP photos are little blurry.
• Camera needs a little light optimization as colours are little enhanced in image, sometimes look good especially in selfie but looses its original colours.
(Colours like Purple, Green &amp; Yellow are overexposed)
• A little lag while switching apps.
• No option to hide files through encryption. (Neither in Gallery app nor in My files app) Extremely disappointed. My phone goes in every hand from kids to my parents. As an adult I need to have control over my data.
• &amp; cannot find Schedule on/off feature (phone switch off time) I had a habit of switching off phone while sleeping and it automatically switched on at 7 AM.
•  Samsung gave Dragon glass in Display (no gorilla), so screen guard is must.
• No plastic back cover inside box.

Pros :
• Battery lasts almost 2 days.
• Fast charger in the box.
• Night mode in camera works really good.
• Awesome video viewing experience in 1080p super AMOLED display.
• No lag while gaming.
• There is an optimizer widge, better if you put it on Home screen.
• One UI 1.5 is good, I never had such experience in Samsung, but there is a lot that needs improvement. Also got 3 updates till now on 1st, 23rd &amp; 31st October 2019.
• Blue-green variant may not look good in image at Amazon website. But when you get it in hand It looks really awesome.

Image:
1&amp;3) 12 MP back camera.
2) wide angle lens.
4) Back camera at night (but not night mode)
5) Paronama
6) Selfie [color of wall is green, so it turned the color of face 'Red', Disappointment]

I have used this phone for about 4 weeks. I didnt had much expectations when i ordered it but when i recieved the product i was pretty much surprised,
The phone was really a #monster.
● Display
The super amoled 6.4 inch display in this phone is fantastic. When switch on the phone you will get to know the quality of the display. You will get a feel of using a premium phone
● Battery life
The 6000 mah battery provided by samsung is the real monster. In this price range you never get to see large batter like this. In real life it would last 2 day easily for normal use and for hardcore use it last one day. Battery backup will not be a issue with this phone
● Camera quality
The camera gives you decent performance, the thing i loved most about its camera is its potrait mode known as selective focus , whenever i shot potrait it gave me brilliant results. The video quality is also good you can shoot 4k video at 30fps . Video stabilization was working fine. In bright light the camera will give you killer performance. In low light the camera performance is average
● Speed
The phone is powered with exynos 9611. This processor does a very good job, the phone is so smooth to use ,no lag issues,apps load faster, There is no issue with speed in this device.
● Gaming
You can play pubg in hdr with ultra frame rate.
But when you play in hdr the images gets little blurry. I recommend you to play pubg in hd mode with ultra frame rate ,that was good. If u take call of duty u can play that in high graphics settings
Overall the gaming performance is good. You can play pubg continous for about 9 hours.
●Charging time
It takes about 2.30 hours to get full charge from 0.
But its a thing u can compromise when u get a 6000 mah battery
○ Build quality
The back of the body is made with polycarbonate substance. The quality feels a bit low but this will not be a issue if u use a backcover.
● Weight management
Samsung has done a great job in Weight management it never feels that you are holding a phone with 6000 mah. The phone weighs about188 grams
●Fingerprint reader and face unlock
The face unlock and fingerprint scanner is quite fast . You may find a bit slow due to the animation provided. Not at all an issue. Setting up both was so easy.
● One UI
The one ui provided by samsung is so user friendly.
I was using ios before i liked one ui more than ios
The dark mode is very good
● Value for money
This phone is 100% value for money

I will recommend you to buy this phone

Writing this review after using for 3 days. Just one word-BEST. SuperAmoled screen gives you bright display while maintaining the colour contrasts. Even the dark mode is easy on eyes. Monster battery keeps it running for a long time. Rear camera is not as expected but still does a pretty decent job. 128 gb storage comes with 108gb free space. The best thing about this phone is its OneUI. It gives near to stock experience with added features like one handed mode etc. So if you are looking for a budget phone in 15-20k segment this is it.

I am writing  this review after 20 days of usage, will update the review after long term usage, while purchasing i was also considering  POCO F1 but finally choose to purchase these one , and believe me i dont regreat my decision  except camera

Here are some pros of this phone
1. Good buid quality : i have opal balck colour and it looks fantastic , but also finger print magnet, its plastic buid and come with gorila glass 3.
2. Light in weight , u dont feel weight of this phone that much as weight distribution is very good as it has that 6000 mah battery.
3.  Fantastic battery backup: in my regular usage of 8-10 hours a day, this phone last for almost 2 days.
4.  Smooth and feature rich UI : UI is buttry smooth, i didnt had any issue while swapping  from one app to other , app were stored in background , ONE UI is so feature rich and customizable, once u will get used to it , u will love it.
5. Display : This was one major reason why i bought this phone , and AMOLED never disappoints , its bright enough to read in direct sunlight, crispier and puchy to produce the differet colours , and i am fan of dark mode in these phone.

6. Physical fingerprints  scanner is really fast and i think istead of having  indisplay fingerprint  scanner , this is really good option to have , plus you can also acces notification  panel from this scanner, which surely helps in regular usage.

7. Good gaming  performance
Cons:

1. Camera : I was expecting  much more out of this 48 megapixel camera, but it just turned out to be gimmick, the camera calibration  is not done properly and the image processing  is also bad, it softeans each and everything,  so you dont get any detail in photos, and it becomes more  irritating  when you capture portrait mode photo.

I dont think there are any other major cons in these phone , i hope Samsung  improves camera quality by software  update .
but as a date i think these is the best phone you can buy in these range and these is coming from someone who has used MI phone till now, so this is as par as that phones and surely will hold good in future.

I have been using Samsung J7 Prime for last3 Years and hence looking for a similar mid range phone. After a lot of research and analysis I zeroed down the 6000 mah battery possessing phone that is Samsung Galaxy M30s.

After using it for good amount of time I understand this is a good phone to own if you are looking for a decent smartphone with average camera performance - have a look in to the pictures I have added; taken from this phone. One of those is from the wide angle lens. I would say the camera quality is average but its a better one at this price. Front camera is also good. Check the specs to know it better.

I am very happy with the battery backup it provides. Best part is despite having a big battery it doesn't have heating issues. And 18 watt charger charges the phone  pretty quickly. So 5 star in that segment.

Performance is also good. I am using the 6gb ram version which guved me around 3gb free all the time. Which is good. It has a performance booster option as well for gaming.

Phone has a plastic back cover which is easily scratchable hence needs a protective gear- lot of options available in market for that. But the display is really great and a good bet at this price. Its also quite big with thinner margins.

Phone appears heavy on hand and gives a feeling of expensive one.

I know there are lot of options available in market in this range but if you are a loyal Samsung customer then this is a good buy in very reasonable price. I got it during Amazon festival in around 15K using my SBI debit card offer.

So finally I what I got in 15 K?
A phone with-
- 6000 mah battery
- Super amoled display
- 6gb ram
-128 gb internal storage
- 48 mp main camera with wide angle and bckground blur camera =triple camera at the back and One camera at front.
- Samsung brand

At last 3Star to Amazon packing. It was not that safe looking but somehow my parcel was in one piece. However it wason time as agreed by Amazon. So thanksfor that.

Totally recommended phone.

Samsung Galaxy M30s is literally amazing. People used to tell me that Samsung Amoled Panels are best to view and it is exactly the same. The display is very beautiful to look onto and as it is amoled, it adds more to the battery also. Actually, I should mention about this monster battery first. For very heavy users, it will definitely gives you total 24 hours of charge from my experience. Very heavy means literally very heavy. Rest of the cases, its more than 1.5 days I'm very happy with it. The best thing is, cameras. They are very good at this piece point and details are amazing. And finally, major point of the review: One UI!! I am getting flagship experience in just budget price! Its literally amazing to use One UI and the features it gave is very good. The supersteady is amazing. Nightmode and all those camera effects work really good. When it comes to performance, since I am not a gamer, I can't give exact details but judging through my daily usage and from some of the famous youtuber reviews, it should work fine and after all its Exynos 9611. It is working really smooth. But, I have experienced one or two call reception problems but I think there may be very low signal ony end too. I will update if issue is more after my thorough usage. Lastly, Its Samsung R&amp;D which puts alot of effort to balance the phone's weight and slimness. When I carry the phone, I didn't feel anytime that I am holding a 6000mAh battery phone! Its so slim that from sides it looks very very premium. I think I have covered all the points and with One UI and all those benefits and with that competitive pricing, M30s can be definitely your pick! Mark it helpful of it helps. That's all for now.

 In Ofline video playing  u can finish 3 full langht movies in just 25% of battery and no charge reduction during inactivity and during night if you  put your pjone with 59 and night  it roughly 58 sometimes
The thing i also like is camara i mean  really good 14000 wort it  closeup images of object like flover and other without addition it will give you a dslr image also a slow motion mode and super slow motion mode is very file and for night and low light photography a night mode and low light mode also work very fine
Professor is also very powerful u can run 7 ro 8 app at time without  any hang and for a gamer like me it comes with game booster whis is also very good for smooth gaming and due to long battery backup it will  give you  awesome exprience of gaming and some smart lock system and other feture including security is also very fine just 1 thing is there is no any inbuilt apploke typ application so u have to download one if your phone is not with you  every time of used by someone els too..and for ram it is not like other phone in which 50% or ram were already in use by system u can use 70 % of your  ram and up to 85% inbuilt storage its also work fine with sd card for best exprience use samsung evo 5 card.

All the features of the phone are awesome. The camera is worth the price along with the rest of the features. No lagging, sensors and face recognition are fast. It only has two minor issues
1) call gets on hold while talking maybe because it doesn't have the conventional sensors.
2) It lacks Samsung apps like Knox, secure folder, or mini pay.

This phone has good display and good battery...rest all is bad..the camera image quality is bad , speaker sound is very low, phone gets heated up on calls and during charging, connectivity is very poor. I bought this as a gift to my wife and I'm embarrassed because of that. And with given history of updates by samsung I don't think it will be rectified anytime soon..so in totality, it was a waste of my hard earned money.

Having network issue with Airtel, Voda and Idea network. You can't make call from Volte network for Airtel/ Voda / Idea network.
This is known issue and Samsung guys knows. Till the time this major issue is not fixed keep away from this phone.

I am disappointed with the camera quality when you click photo with 48 megapixel then it takes too many times to save the photo. Samsung must to solve problem with next update. The quality of selfie camera also must be update. And fingerprint sensor is also quite slow hope  Samsung will resolve the problem after next Android 10 update. Otherwise overall performance is very good I am facing no problem and I am using this mobile for more than 10 days. Thank you Samsungfor making a very good smartphone within the price range of 17000. According to me there is no other smartphone within the price range of 20000 comparison to this Samsung m30 s. Samsung m30s is too much better then recently launched Realme XT and Redmi Note 8 Pro yes I am using all of this 3 mobile.

One of the most value for money phone I ever purchased.
LOOKS: it is fairly good looking phone and fits in hand very very
TOUCH: It has an option of increasing TOUCH sensitivity  if we put a screen guard
Battery: amazing experience,  i dont have ti carry power bank or the phone charger. It lasts for a complete day even for a very heavy use. And it doesnt heat up during charging

Processor: very good processor if u play heavy games . And even after playing these games for long tine the screen or phone does not heat up. It is just slightly warm

Camera: it  is a dream come true camera. Works smoothly on auto mode and have lot of options. Especially the best shot suggestion.
Dual sim standly: I ised two 4G sims and can easily switch between the internet if sim1 internet service is slow . Also calls can be transferred to other sim if the forst one is unavailble due to weak signal

Overall the M30s is worth the price they offer for... This review is based on the usage after 2 months... The phone does not get hang much... Also no heating problems even during playing games like call of duty, pes, etc... The fingerprint reader sometimes does not recognize, maybe due to the way i use it.... front camera does not offer you much clarity in low lights, even in room lights but rear camera is good enough... battery life is good and lasts for just over a day with bluetooth, wifi, mobile data and gaming... but with the 6000Mah, we would expect a bit more...

After using this phone for more than 2 months now, i can say that this phone is a OK kind of. Nothing to get excited other than the battery. I donno how i got attracted to this. For price tag of 17k.
Spec shows 6 gb, i never felt that even though i dont have any game installed. It lags, response is slow, surprisingly when screen rotation is on then it forgets to go back to vertical position, it lags, one need to wake it up. Camera is overspecified. Picture quality is pretty average, never looked like of 48 gb. Clarity seen on this phone for any particular picture is not even nearby on other devices.
Overall I'm not happy with this. Since return window is closed so continued using. And the seller of this phone also lags, he also forgot to dispatch. I was required to take customer sevice desk help to wakeup him. Not worthy.

I have been using the m30s for a week and I wanted to share my review
1) Look:- the phone looks and feels good. It has a gradient blue-green finish at the back which looks cool. Even though this phone is 188 gms it feels comfortable in hand and the weight management is excellent.
2) Display:- The display panel of this phone is beautiful. It has a super amoled screen with good brightness level and I have no issue in viewing in direct sunlight. These days the notch is in trend with every phone, this phone comes with infinity U-notch. I personally don't like notches but as it has an amoled display you could resize while watching videos and would not get obstructed by the notch also being amoled Display the pixels would be off thus saving your battery.
3) Rear camera:- The rear camera photos are good with adequate lighting and sharpness, but the quality disrupts when you zoom in.
4) Battery:- The battery capacity is huge with 6000 mAh which easily lasts two days with lite use. I gamed on it for an hour and the battery only drops by 10%, After a whole day it drops by 30% (depends on your usage).
5) Build quality:- The build quality of the phone is poor but at this price range you have to comprise. The Back panel and fingerprint sensor is made out of thin plastic.
6) Front camera:- The front camera is not par with what we get at this price range but it clicks good photos but still after zooming the quality degrades.
7) Software optimization :- this phone is new and the software optimization will take time but it already has got an update for bugs, camera and software which made the phone smoother but more work can be done .
8) Last but not the least; One UI:- Other phone boast about their internal and hardware but the One UI stand on top of all.
I personally like this UI which has tons of features but also maintains its simplicity.
It has everything you need with gestures and features like dark mode and It also gives you the feel and comfort which brings the experience to a whole new level.
Everything is adjusted so that you could use this phone in one hand everything in the settings could be reached by your thumb. Everything in the UI is well organized and most of the features are here as this is the same UI used in Samsung flagship phones.
Conclusion:- You could buy this phone if you need performance, battery, display and a good user interface. But don't think of using this phone outside without case or tempered glass, still if you don't it also has free screen replacement for one year but I would be careful as at this price range you get a pretty decent phone.

After using for 7 days I find that  battery  is really  monster,fingerprint  sensor is also good ,but the camera  quality  is not as expected  from Samsung, in day lights photo  quality is good but the camera  takes time to focus on object,many times the photos look overexposed even in sufficient  light  conditions,also the photo in low light  conditions are also not very  impressive,they show good amount of  noise and haze on photo in dim light,camera quality could  have been  improved in this range of price.screen is super amoled and phone has Dolby atmos sound that is in use only when you use your headphones.front camera quality  should  have been more efficient.other brands in the same price range are providing super efficient  camera quality.one more problem that I have found in this phone is that it has issues with network  connections,on comparing with my previous phone and other mobile phones of my house with different brands, I found that this product has a
problem of limited network  access which results in  poor internet  speed.

With a capacity of 6000mah battery. It easily lasts 2 and a half days. Being used to charging phones frequently even while having a flagship phone. This phone has kind of made me forget about it. This is truly a phone that will make your charging problems go away. It's got a beautiful display and the ratio is just perfect. It's lag free and buttery smooth. The looks and design are at par with the competitors. For 14k the build quality is worth every rupee. It's got 6 GB of ram and 128 gb of storage. My s9 plus cost me 3 times more for it!. The camera quality needs some software tweaks. But overall I couldn't have asked for a better phone at that price. Am a 100% satisfied after choosing to go for this phone. Truly delivers what it promised. Keep going strong samsung!.

I use it from 15 days. It is the best mobile from Samsung under 15000. Usually Samsung flagship phone are very costly.
It is best mobile the battery life is very good. Before it I have Lenovo k8 note phone which has 4000 mah battery I use it all day and charge it two times in a day. But Samsung m30s mobile battery is very good I charge it only one time in a day and use about 10 to 12 hours regularly. In normal uses like calling, internet  surfing, social media it gives you about 2 to 3 days battery life. Let's  talk about camera the photo quality is good but when we zoom photo the quality is not good. Front photo is good but again zooming quality is not good. So the photos zooming quality is not good. Let's talk about screen I haven't any words to say about screen quality  because it has samoled screen which is doubtless. Performance of mobile is very good it has exynos 9611 octa core core 2.3 ghz processor which gives you ultimate performance.
Overall I recommend it for all rounder users which budget is under 15000.

This is my review and my experience upon usage of the Samsung M30s til today of
16-10-2019.
I bought the Mobile through Amazon Prime On 28-09-2019 by 12pm a one day head before the normal sell òf Mobile i.e; 29-09-2019.
Cost:- Rs 13999/- with a discount of Rs 1399/- and with a Amazon cash back of
Rs 1000/-
So,finally bought it for Rs 11,600/-.
Variant:- 4gb ram and 64gb rom
Colour:- sapphire blue
I received the mobile on 29-09-2019 by 11am
I.e; delivery by 1 day.
Due to some reasons i had to open the mobile on 1-10-2019.
My previous mobile was Lenovo K4 note which I used for almost 4 years
Which was a 3gb ram and 16 rom variant and battery was about 3300mah.
Though my previous phone was excellent in all aspects but the battery life was not upto the mark.
Playing heavy games like Pubg,Asphalt and etc games were difficult in it as the internal storage was less.
So it was difficult for me to manage the battery and it was also difficult to charge it 100% as the time taken by it was around 2hr30min.
So,i was looking for a mobile with big and good battery,with good internal storage,good camera.
Then i had to hear about the Samsung M30s the successor of the Samsung M30 which was also a good mobile( Had a thought of buying it before).
So,I waited until it's offical release on 18-09-2019,then i was surprised by its specifications and feature.
I started to search about it in the internet and youtube from 19-09-2019,every tech bloggers and tech Youtubers were happy to share their review on the mobile in very positive manner.They were really impressed by Battery and Battery life,Camera performance , chipset Samsung Exynos 9611 with octa core processor performance was excellent.
It was having the Dolby Atoms in earphone only which was excellent.
Out of the Box with Android 9 (pie) and various other features.
I was really impressed with their reviews and opinions on mobile and finally decided to buy it.
Coming to my experience.
I unboxed the box on 1-10-2019 and opened the Mobile,i was suprised with the Display size of the mobile as my previous mobile was about 5.5inches Full HD IPS LCD DISPLAY where this comes with 6.4 Full HD+ Super Amoled Display which is very Good in this Price range.
Another big suprising is waiting for us in the box that is we don't receive any Back case and screen protectors which was a minus point.
Mobile comes with the support of two sims slot and a MicroSD slot which is a good point where the other mobile like Mi Note 7 pro don't( hybrid slot)
It also supports the Dual Volte i.e; we can use two jio sims at a time in the mobile.
It comes with fast charging support of 15w it will the battery upto 100% in 2h15min.
Inspite of 6000mah battery the mobile is very lite weight of 188gms,the mobile is very handy.
The built quality of the mobile is was not upto the mark.
It comes with a plastic built on the back which will lead to the cracks on the mobile on placing on the hard surface.
The Android pie is very good and it comes with one Ui in it which is a very user friendly Ui and it comes with Inbuilt dark mode which is a good point in the mobile.
Coming to the fingerprint sensor,I noticed lagging in it and but it is accurate it will take around 2-3 sec to recognizes the Finger and unlock the mobile.
Face unlock is very good as iam using it for the first time so,i can't explain about it more.
Coming to the cameras,they are doing very well and super,i will provide some samples of them.
But I faced some lags in the recognition of the objects in front of it.
Comes with different camera modes.
Video mode comes with supersteady mode recording which is very nice point in this price range and it also comes with 4K recording support.
Which is very good in this price range from a international brand like Samsung.
Regarding selfie camera which is about 16mp which is very good but it also facing lagging in the face recognition of the object.
Another good point is that AR emojis is available in the mobile which is very present in the mobile of higher price range.
Battery life is very good on a full charge of 100% it can provide a life of 1.5-2 days with a moderate usage which is very good.
Coming to the charging time with 15watt fast charger which is 2hr15min which is good for 6000mah.where other brands like Mi,Realme, Vivo,Oppo are providing super fast charging of 20w-30w under the same price range which is a minus point here.
Coming to mobile usage we have preinstalled bloatware Apps and advertisement notifications are present in the mobile which is also a minus point.
Exyons 9611 chipset performance is upto the mark.
Coming to mobile calling using volte support is very good and voice output of calls is upto the good marks.
Video calling videos are also good.
Regarding the Gaming
We can play the Games like Pubg in HDR graphics which is a good point in this price range.
but we can see some lagging while playing in HDR mode.
Coming to heating issues on heavy usage of the mobile the temperature rises can be seen upto 5°-6°c degrees which is very normal.It is very less when compared to other mobiles like MI,REALME,OPPO,VIVO and etc.
The SAR VALVE of the mobile is very very low that is 0.468 watts per kg when compared to the other mobiles of same price range.
The mobile also supports the native Video calling options which is very good.
Inbuilt call recorder is also present in the mobile which is a very point in the mobile.
ROM management we receive a usable storage of 57-58gb which is very good
Coming to Heavy usage
On the heavy usage of the mobile the battery life seems upto 10hrs40min only which is very good but it needed to improved by the further updates.
Some problems and software issues need to be fixed by the further updates by Samsung.
Hope Samsung will take care of it.
Pros:
1. Battery
2. Camera
3. Dolby Atmos
4. Performance of the chipset
5. One Ui
6. Native video calling option
7. Good ram management
8. Dark mode
9. Display with FHD+ of the Super Amoled.
10. Screen to body ratio of 91.9% with less
  bezels.
11. Good Battery life of the mobile.
12. Wifi hotspot sharing
13. Easy and handy
14. Support of Dual volte
15. Presence of triple slot.
16. Design is very good.
17. light weight if the mobile
18. Super steady mode in camera
19. Support of the Widevine L1 support the
  FHD streaming of NETFLIX and Amazon.
20. Finally cost of the mobile.
Cons:
1. No presence of Backcase and screen
  protector in the box
2. Lags in the rear Camera and selfie camera
3. Fast charger of higher watts must have
  been given in the box.
4. Presence of Bloatware app  and
  unnecessary Advertisements.
5. There is no notification light
6. Dolby Atmos must have been in the normal
  Mode also.
These are the some of Pros and Cons of the mobile.
This mobile is going to rule the mid range budget section of Rs.14000 to Rs.17000 with this wonderful specifications and this one going to be good choice for the mid range mobile lovers.
Hope my explanations reached yours expectations and needs.
One final mention
When you start using the Samsung mobiles with this type of Display of Super Amoled FULL HD+ when you will be addicted to them like me.
The usage of the other mobiles display will dull and won't be sharp to entertain you.
Thank you for time.

@Galaxy M30s Design :
The design of the Galaxy M30s is not too different from the M30. It gets a similar plastic unibody panel on the back with a triple camera setup on the top left corner and a fingerprint sensor placed above center, making it easy to reach.Again, going with plastic does make the Galaxy M30s feel less premium compared to some of the competition out there, but I really do mind this at all. It keeps the phone feeling lightweight at 188 grams, which is mighty impressive for a phone packing a big 6,000mAh battery.

@Galaxy M30s Display :

On the front, the Galaxy M30s gets a similar 6.4-inch FHD+ (2340x1080) Super AMOLED Infinity-U display as the M30. The display was a major highlight of the Galaxy M30, so it's nice to see that the company hasn't changed things here on the M30s. It looks as bright and attractive as you would expect from a Samsung display. Bezels around the screen are slim, except for a slightly thick chin. You still get around 90 per cent screen-to-body ratio, which is great.The Super AMOLED display on the M30s offers excellent viewing angles.

@Galaxy M30s Performance and Software :

Samsung Galaxy M30s is powered by a 2.3GHz Exynos 9611 octa-core chipset based on a 10nm process. This is the same processor that also powers the new Galaxy A50s. The Exynos 9611 SoC is equipped with a Mali G72 MP3 GPU and is paired with up to 6GB of RAM.

@Galaxy M30s Camera :

The M30s gets an upgrade in the camera department as well. The 48MP triple camera setup is a major buzzword this year and Samsung is catching up to that trend. The M30s offers a 48-megapixel main sensor using its own GM1 sensor.The camera system includes an 8-megapixel wide-angle lens and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. On the front, the M30s offers a 16-megapixel selfie camera.

@Galaxy M30s Battery :

The biggest feature that separates the Galaxy M30s from every other smartphone right now is the battery. This is the only smartphone in India as of now that offers an insanely large 6,000mAh battery. It even makes the 5,000mAh battery on the M30 look small in comparison. With a huge 6,000mAh battery, Samsung says the M30s will offer a two-day battery life with ease, and I found this to be true and then some.

Quick review :

1) Pros..

Stellar battery life
AMOLED display
Lightweight design
Competitive cameras

2) Cons

Lacks premium finish
15W fast charging is slow
Low light camera performance still feels lacking

*Writing this review after 15 days of usage*

I bought 6GB/128GB variant for 16.9k/-

BATTERY:-
In these 15 days of usage, I have charged my phone for about 10 times, thanks to the large battery.
And each time it took around 3-3.5 hrs to get completely charged with the 15W fast charger provided in the box.
(One thing to note: Samsung claims to provide 6000 mAh battery but in reality it's just 5800 mAh.
6000 mAh is the typical rating of battery tested under special conditions.)
Impressive battery to weight ratio, doesn't feel heavy.

CAMERA:-
Yet another department where M30s shines.
It has 48MP primary camera and there is really nothing to complain about. Personally I don't like the Night Mode option, it feels like a gimmick to me. Other than that you get almost each and every feature in camera department including Ultrawide camera and in-Depth camera for portrait shots.
Regarding Videography with the Primary Camera you get videos upto 4K, SlowMo, Super SlowMo, even Hyperlapse as well.

OVERVIEW:-
- Display is crisp.
- Fingerprint sensor is fast, unlike previous samsung devices I have used.
- Face unlock is fast and accurate most of the times.
- Front camera is nice.
- Dedicated Gaming mode is awesome.
- Always On Display comes in handy.
- Dolby Atmos (just for Earphones).
- Digital wellbeing included, nice to see.
- Some bloatware was pre-installed, but it can be uninstalled.
- Peak brightness level is impressive.
- 3.5 mm Audio Jack provided...which is a lifeline for many out there.
- Mono speaker is sufficiently loud, but would have been nice to see Stereo-Speaker implementation.
- Network reception is excellent.
- Compared to some other UI, OneUI is pretty well designed and overall it feels like a smooth ride.
- You get System wide dark theme with OneUI (my personal favorite).
- RAM management is awesome (3/6 GB was available after initial setup)
- And roughly 104/128 GB storage was free after initial setup.
- Dedicated micro SD card slot (worth mentioning).
- No NFC that means No Samsung Pay.
- Sadly NO plastic case, NO tempered glass and NO earphones in the box.

Overall, it's the best in class budget phone of the year. I would personally recommend the 6GB/128GB variant for future proofing.

P.S. Thanks for reading till the end.

Finally a worthy budget competitor from Samsung. The built quality, especially the display is lucrative. As compared to other Chinese competitors, you won't get this great display quality in any other device. The camera is pretty impressive, especially in natural light. The main highlight is obviously the battery which easily makes it the most long running device in this segment. Don't fall for other Chinese brands just for their bit better processors and cameras as you might loose this beautiful display and battery!

First of all got a defective piece and got a replacement from Amazon which is great !

This this phone is being designed for value for money , you can't expect too high from this range of device . Well the new piece I received is much good , meet my expectations, battery is good , lasts a longer than old Samsung devices .

I am using this phone for 2 weeks now and so far this phone performed more than what I expected from this phone. I won't be talking about specs here but my experience.

- The best thing you’ll like about this phone is the Display. You won’t notice individual pixel because of good resolution and OLED’s that Samsung provides is still a no match by other manufacturers.
- The battery is the next best thing about this phone I like. The first charge gave me almost 3 days of usage, but that was something from 100% charge to 2%. On regular biases, I charge my phone every alternate day.
- One UI is something that is definitely an improvement. Last time when I used a Samsung phone, it was a Galaxy tab 2 and it bloatware rich UI performed so bad, I thought I’ll never use a Samsung phone again. A lot of things changed after, definitely the hardware has improved a lot but the One UI also brought a lot of improvements, which make the experience smoother, less cluttered and preserves most of the native android features in its original sense.
- I don’t use the camera a lot, but the camera I feel is average. It will be good most of the time.
- The fingerprint reader’s detection speed is average.
- Build Quality. The looks-wise phone looks good, it’s glossy plastic. Build wise it doesn’t feel solid but it might few take bumps as plastic absorbs shocks in a better way compared to other materials.

Overall experience: I feel Samsung balanced out by giving a good display and battery, saving some money on a chip which they manufacture themselves and keeping overall average hardware to achieve a phone like this.
Overall it really is a nice phone.

1 Mobile phone design is best.
2 In the box there was not screen guard and case for the mobile phone, where other mobile phones company are providing these things. Eg : redmi, Lenovo, etc.
3 Mobile phone has good features but it has not given several features which other mobile are having, such has the phone is not showing interest speed on title bar, it is not showing the total usage of data on title bar, it is not having the feature of password system for every app which other mobile phone is having, there are many other such minor features which are missing.
4 Please study those features which are missing and try to provide them in the next update of mobile phone.
5 If any user use such features in existing mobile phone and if any one not got these features in these mobile phone then the user not get satisfied.
6 Please study the redmi mobile phone features,  they are giving best features.
7 Mobile phone has very big battery, as per the big battery it is not lasting for long time, please study about it also and improve in next update.
8 My mobile is giving some touch screen problems in just 20 to 25 days of buying.
9 please solve all these problems and make these mobile phone best.
10 In the next update give all the small and minor features which are missing, and do it soon.

Display quality is awesome
Camera quality is good , battery capacity also good. I am totally disappointed with the charger cable.  It's too short like a power bank cable and charging time also more than 3 hours. I have some doubts is that original Samsung charger and cable.  And another big disappointment is Amazon delivery process. Delivery process takes too much time.

Pros:
1.Big monster 6000mAh battery last 1.5 days with normal use.
2.Charging is also good and it is a 15 watt fast charger.
3.Buttons gives you nice tactile effect.
4.Headphone jack is good,it fits your headphone very nicely with a tick sound.
5.Display is SAmoled and it is way batter than LCD panel.The colors are very accurate  and I have compared  the display with Redmi note 7 pro,Note 7s,Realme 5 pro and M30s superAmoled display  is miles ahead.
6.Gaming: I played 2 games PUBG and COD and both are running very good.You can play PUBG at HDR &amp; Ultra settings but there will be some frame drops and game feels laggy so I recommend you to play at Smooth &amp; Extreme settings, it will give you 50-55 fps.COD is butter Smooth  in high setting  so don't  worry about that.
7.Speaker is very loud and clear.
8.One UI is amazing.It is a very handy and customizable.

Cons:
1.Camera is not upto the mark as it says 48 mega pixel and I have compared  with my old phone  Honor 8  but I'm  very disappointed with the results.I will the camera 7 out of 10.
2.It has spuper steady video mode which is a good thing but it uses 8 megapixel lens so you have to compromise with the quality.
3.Display is very soft,it gets cracked very easily.My friends M30s display got cracked with 2 drops from the pocket so you have to be careful.

So this is what I have experienced till now and I will let you know if I get something new.

Am giving clear cut review...

🔳 Battery 6000 mah but it's 100% charged battery only working for 1and half day even it's a new Mobile. After 6 months or one year it may or may not upto for half day.

🔲Charging takes more time. They given fast charging method but that works normally.

🔲 camera showing 48 mp. But the photos not giving that much clarity. Object getting dullness. It only attracts green sceneries well.
There is no flash while taking pictures.

🔳Processing also very slow even in 6gb ram

🔲Internet is very slow because of bandwidth taking by mobile. It's really slow compared with xiomi mobiles.

🔳If there is weak signal strength. It's not connecting. It might most problem in rural areas

🔲Oled Display was nice

🔳Front camera was not that much good and there is no flash for this cost also.

🔲Sometimes it's hanging

🔳There is no boosting option for closing apps and meeting boost

🔲Torch is nice. There is option like increase and decrease brightness level

🔳While using wifi...Calling is getting noise or breaking in voice

🔲Weight also some more high. The design is good but not slim.

Finally it's not better than mi mobile. In all aspects. Cost to battery life. Ratting _5 out of 10

One of the big mistakes to buy this phones
Pros.:
- Big battery with backup equal to 4k 5k battery phones, not more
- Display is Ok.
- bloatware is minimum
- dedicated sd card slot

Cons.:
- Disappointing Samsung one UI, lacks many common features such as shortcut to lock screen without using physical buttons, no quickball type function available, no settings shortcut can b put on homescreen like other phones such as redmi, realme, no split screen (imagine its android 9 and still there is no split screen), no feature showing daily data usage- samsung is stuck in the old age where monthly cycle is followed, no feature to show the data speed in the notification bar, no screenshortcut for taking screenshot (physical buttons for screnshot is so old, my grandpa used that)
- average sound in earphones (SAME EARPHONES GIVE GOOD OUTPUT ON OTHER PHONES) to say the least, speaker sound is pathetic, theme store is uninspiring with lacklustre themes
- no led notification( hello samsung, how can u forget something like a led notification) so be sure to wake screen to check every time for missed calls, msgs, whether phone is charging or not.
- camera is of average quality. Does not do justice to samsung brand and the 48 mega pixel tag
- headphone jack at bottom is a pain.

Opinion - samsung has tried to ride on the 6000mah battery usp to woo the customers. But be assured though the battery is mammoth, the battery backup is average. With the primitive UI/ software which is atleast 5 years back in time.,i strongly advise people against buying this one. Thank me later.

I'm using M30s from last 10 days and I would like to share my views:

Battery life : I would say this is the main feature of this phone. It has 6000 milli Ampere battery which easily last up to 1.5-2 days for normal user like me and if you are a true gamer or watches more videos or use it extensively then also it will easily last for 8-10 hrs of continuous usage.

Display : In this price tag it comes with super amoled display which is really awesome and the display you can compare with some of Samsung's flagship phones like S9 or S10 plus.

Camera : Camera is also awesome. You can record 4k videos with super steady mode. Front camera is also decent. It doesn't add extra colors in the picture as some of the phones does rather what I feel the pictures are really natural..

Performance: It has Samsung's most efficient processor and it is really awesome. I didn't observed any lag or frame drop while playing heavy games.

Sound : It has decent sound and comes with 3.5 mm Jack and you can also take advantage of Dolby atmos which really enhances the sound output.

Overall: if you have a budget under 15k then this is the one of the best (or beast in terms of battery) options currently available.

Thanks!!

The phone look and feel is good. The camera is not that great. The photos doesn't have 48mp clarity. Photo gets blurry after zoom. I really didn't like backside finger print reader. Battery takes more than 2hours to charge 100%. I am facing mainly one issue that sometimes my network is not reachable and signal strength is high only. I need to restart to make it work again.

Battery is monster ideal for watching movies back to back. Camera is very good at this price range. Definitely software upgrade will make it top notch. Within budget range it’s the best. 64 megapixel ones of others will be a total failure as I had checked some other brands visiting in store.

I purchased this product after watching many online review videos and trusting brand Samsung that they must have improved their game in the last 5 years since I abandoned them. My overall experience is horrible!
1. The phone is terribly, terribly slow. It takes two seconds to unlock using the fingerprint scanner. Takes 1 second to launch simple apps like Messaging or Whatsapp.
2. The rear camera blows everything out of proportion. The colors, lighting etc. everything is blown out. Even an older device like iPhone 6 clicks much better and natural photographs.
3. The front camera is a farce. It tries to hide it's incompetence using artificial processing which means as soon as you zoom-in the image gets distorted.
4. The display is awesome. However, the auto-brightness doesn't works because there is no sensor at all. It relies on front camera and by the time it sense the lighting conditions they have most likely changed.
5. Notification options are too many and confusing. Could have been much simpler, I mean WHY??? and the lock screen does not lights up whenever there are any notifications, sometimes it will if it feels like.
6. Even the battery is not awesome. My POCO F1 delivered much better battery performance in a 4000 mAH battery. And it takes FOREVER, to charge this battery using the supplied charger. Like FOREVER!

Phone is amazing unique in style....its really look so classy and expensive...superb camera quality and wonderful 4k video recording feature with super slow motion and hyperlapse features makes it unbeatable in this price range. Its a Premium smartphone in budget. I really appriciate samsung coming with this fully featured smartphone in budget. The other good feature its really fast u can play fps games like pubg call of duty mobile games on utlra settings and hdr mode without any lap. The performance of phone is really good its unbeatable in this price segment. And the last but not least its battery its really long lasting. U can use this phone 2 days with a single charge. Battery is so powerful its really make u feel monster. I suggest u buy this phone without any hesitation. #gomonster

Poor camera quality along with lower customisation available within app. Display is ok. Don't go by the numbers they provided like 48mp camera, 6GB RAM etc. It's not fast even when not loaded. UI and icon, theme nothing seems latest. I am unsatisfied with it on very first day And worst thing return is not allowed for this device. I gave it 5stars otherwise they won't show this review.

So guys, here's my review after using it for 7 days:

First of all, the device has bit disappointed me on the camera, as I have compared images of my brother's newly purchased Realme Xt and this M30s, and I would say this M30s is no where near the Realme or any other phone for that matter, because the camera is literally a DISASTER and I am talking about both rear and front! On a normal mode, it looks like some feature phone camera with all that smoky, shallow and dull colors, if you switch colors to warm mode it gets little better. However, it still remains the worst ever camera!!

Speed according to me is decent, since being a normal user and using it for 7 days, I would say it never lagged during day to day usage, which I think is good.

Now, coming to the battery part, battery is pretty good, I am a normal user doing WhatsApp, E-mail, Chrome browsing, watching YouTube etc.... (I am not into gaming) on a first day  (with 100% charge) it lasted for 48 hours with 12 hours of screen time and 10% still there, which is great. (Mind it I have Night Mode activated which means all menus and settings shows up in black color, it saves battery, this is what they say.)

Coming to the Screen, screen is AMOLED and is great, you get that Night mode which looks kinda cool and saves battery, I used Vivid mode so the screen gives some rich color, on normal mode it looks kinda dull.

Now, Fingerprint sensor, it's not that good guys, it's not even normal, if you have slight wet hands or hands with slightest sweat, it will not unlock, you will have to clean your hands and sensor to get it work. Face Unlock seems good.

Network reception is not good, my last phone was a Motorola phone and with Vodafone network it almost never switched to 3G while data connected, but with this M30s it was switching to 3g and 2g very frequently when I was watching Yotube videos last night. And, I was getting 2-3 bars constantly with my Motorola but with this one I am getting 0 to 1 at max at the same location.

Body is good, being a plastic body I like it, nothing to complain about it. Weight is much less compared to Oppo and Realme phones which is great. Samsung One UI is way better than Oppo and Realme's Color OS which I absolutely hate.

Overall, I am positive about battery and screen and the interface, rest of all features and specs are not that great.

If you're a normal user not into the gaming and all and can bear about camera and little buggy fingerprint sensor than you should go for it. I have kept the device just for the battery and screen, had these not been there, I would have returned the device or sold it off the same day.

I have been using Samsung M30s since last three months and it has proven to be one of the finest product in this price category as testified by industry veterans. The fingerprint sensor that is built on the back panel is smooth like butter and the camera quality is first-class and gives a good competition to phones near 25k price bracket. But hold on, the most sensational part of the device is its batter life, which lasts for 2 days with a single charge given a normal usage. The display is captivating and the speed is A1. Thus, I will recommend this to everyone looking for a phone under 15k to experience the best of 'The Samsung' who has been an undisputed leader for economical yet quality products  and after sale-services.

Let me first start saying that i was an ios user for as long as i remember but after the multiple isssues with iphones and most importantly horrible battery life in iphones , i plan to made the switch to android.

Since i have spent over 50k on buying iphone, i wanted something which provides more features , better quality at decent price , while looking for such a product i stumbled across Samsung M30s which was about to launch in Oct. Being very excited for this product i waited for a month.

Suprising enough for me this phone is all that it promises. I bought one during Amazon sale @14k after getting card discounts and Amazon pay cashback. First let me give a shoutout to @AmazonIndia whose service is amazingly fast and best .
Now its been more than 2 weeks since i have been using this phone . All i can say coming from IOS to android , from Iphone7 to samsung M30S i am satisfied with the transition  . Here are some pros and cons from my side based on my personal usage for past 2 weeks :-

Pros -

1) Best battery life in the price range , i am getting
  2 days with mobile net on all the time , voice call
  , watching youtube and listening to podcasts
2) Camera quality is amazing
3) Sound is pretty good
4)  Amoled screen is amazing
5)  There is no heat up issues even with heavy
  gaming

Cons -

1) No corning gorilla glass
2) Network issues are there with the device .

Pros:-
1. Very long lasting battery
2. Sleek and beautiful design
3. Smooth in running multiple apps and games
4. Camera with a massive clearity
5. Quick charging under 2 hours

Cons:-
1. Nothing found till right now

So I liked the product. Thanks Samsung for this wonderful phone under 12k with Bank discount and amazon cashback.

I will start my review with this quotes... "Tere chehre se nazar nahi hatati, Nazaare hum kya dekhe"....Phone is just wow.. Got deleivered at around 9:30  Early in the morning Saturday as promised by Amazon. Well done Amazon.... Phone looks good, works as faster as expected with the specifications..  About the battery life.. if you are a normal user and dont use your phone too much then this is the best thing that you can buy. You dont hve to think to recharge your battery for 2-3  Days.  I love this phone a lot beause this is my first Samsung phone. Migrated from Apple to Samsung. Lets see how would be the experience... but the phone is really a MONSTER... #happyCustomer #samsung #cheersAmazon..

Some of them are saying the camera is bad but from my experience on using this phones camera i feel like the rear camera gives you great quality photos and the video stabilization  is worth mentioning,  i got many awesome shots under good lighting conditions.

The front camera is good but its a bit soft..  and i hope samsung could fix it with a software update.

Audio is really great and the screen sAmoled is great whe  watching 1080p contents.

Battery will last for 2 days  1.5 days on heavy usage..  no overheating issues so far while gaming.

The build quality is as expected  to be from a plastic body.  Its an amazing phone for that price range.

'Samsung' the brand itself is sufficient but i like to add more points :
1)The best battery backup on any smartphone.
2)sAmoled display of samsung is the best.
The best display among smartphones is by samsung and it also manufdctures for apple.
3)The processor is good and battery efficient.
4)Cameras are good at the price segment.
Takes 2:20 minutes to charge full and then can give more than 2 days battery life.
5)Sound is Dolby but only for earphones and headphones and also speaker is loud.
Nothing more to tell just apply the bank offers and go for it.....

The samsung galaxy M30s (Pearl White , 4GB-64gb) is the best budget smartphone in current market with its FHD+ Super Amoled display ,which is the best and also the camera quality with its massive 6000mAh battery
Look wise it's ok not that good because it doesn't  has a glass back and also this phone is not for people who plays heavy games and its processor eynox 9611 is  not that good as compared to snapdragon 712 but if you are a regular user who uses only social media and other apps this might not be a bigger issue for them.
And so it's a better choice  with such a good company (Samsung) providing all this in 14k.
Also the plus point here is the after service which you get from Samsung customer service  centre.

This is not a phone , it's a beast .
Samsung calling it as monster, yes it's a monster
-display quality is next to none in this price range ( none of the phones can come close to this ) ,
- Call quality ,signal reception is just great .
- Earpiece is so loud and even at high volume you'll not find any distortion .
-Battery life is stellar ( real monster)
- Though it has 6k mah battery the weight distribution is great , it doesn't feel bulky .
- One UI is so smooth it has plenty of features you can play around, you'll easily get used to the UI ( it's very simple &amp; feature rich ) .
- Camera under good lighting situations produces great pics , Dynamic range is good , colour saturation is great .
-Low light/ artificial light camera is average. ( C+)
- selfie camera under good lighting situations produces decent photos , struggle at low light.
-Video stabilization is A+ just awesome
- auto focus in video is a hit or miss
- you can even play PUBG at high graphics with minimal frame drops , gaming also good
If you want
A+ display
A+ battery life
and low light camera is on your low priority then this is the phone for you.
I'm in love with the phone ( low light camera is not the highest priority for me )

So I've been using this phone for 10days now. After intensive use I'm writing this review.
First the bad part.
Cons:
1. The selfie camera could've been better, it's not crystal clear like Realme or Oppo phones in this price segment.
2. The wide angle camera- If enough light is present it performs well, but when light is slightly on the lower side, the pictures come hazy.
3. Build quality- It's plastic made unibody design that's fine, but the problem is the material used here is too thin. The phone while holding it, if you press a little hard the plastic gives a clicky sound. I think Samsung could've used better plastic here.

Pros:
1. The 48mp camera: This camera is better than any camera in this price segment. It has beaten Note 7Pro and Realme 5 Pro like a pro. The dynamic range, the potraits, the edge detection is fantastic.
2. Battery backup- If you're a intensive user, expect around 2days of battery life, but if you don't use your phone much, you can surely get around 2.5 to even 3days of juice without charging.
3. Display- This is the best super amoled experience I've ever had. It's buttery smooth, you won't know until you experience it.
4. Touch- It's super smooth.
5. Fingerprint and face detection- Fast and efficient. No nonsense here.
6. Gaming- This is a bit tricky part.
I've tested PUBG, Asphalt 9 and both played smoothly in this phone. No heating whatsoever. PUBG in HD Smooth runs like butter, Asphalt too runs like a charm here, but in this price there are other phones which might give you a slightly better gaming performance, but hey they won't give you the mammoth battery or the rich Samsung experience.

Final Verdict:
If you want a overall rich experience with multimedia, performance and camera go for this phone. Use a back cover because the back is not that strong.
P.S.: I got the 4/64 version for 8500/- by exchanging my Redmi 4 and using SBI debit cards and getting cashbacks.

There are a few things that annoy smartphone users the most, the trade-off between cost, features and brand recognition before buying a phone. Samsung hits third one with no issues, but when finding the best sweet spot between cost and features, it struggled. With brands like Xiaomi capturing the market with phones hitting the cost versus features sweet spot, samsung was lacking. But with samsung m30s, it tackled all the smartphones in that segment.
Awesome battery life - have been using it for quite sometime and easily serves 2 full days with seldom to moderate use.
Awesome camera quality - A DSLR equivalent for quarter the price! It beats any phone in this segment.
Seamless UI - samsung is known for its versatile and seamless 'one UI' is fast and user friendly.
Monster display- The sAMOLED display is in the face and makes it look like a flagship featured phone.

I was little concerned about the weight of the phone because of it packing a big battery, but I was wrong. There is little to no difference compared to my previous phone.

The only thing and it can be very trivial, is the finger print reader. Little slower than usual but barely noticeable.

In a nutshell, It is a phone that is worth your money.

Poor build quality. Camra performace is very poor. So think before buy. Back plastic will diappoint u. 48 mp camra is just like number of mp. Front camra also poor performance. I wuld recomand u vivo z1x or realme mobiles instead of it.

I got this phone for 13999 + 10 % discount on sbi  debit card =12599. Used for 3 days. Battery life super. Even though it has 4 GB ram and 64 GB storage, it is slow in processing jobs, especially on setting area. performance is not up to the mark.  Again body finish is good but polycarbonate material, not durable as metallic body. Small scarch in display can lead to damage.  No support for display. Camera is very good. Battery life very good. Perfomance little slow. Durability short. Sound as usual in Samsung mobile is low. 4 GB ram performance is as low as 2 GB ram. Lots of un wanted apps prw installed consuming storage space.  Overall Samsung name and brand is selling. I will give 3 stars out of 5 and price is a little high compare to other mobiles providing these facilities.

Like:
- Battery rocks: 6000mah is easily sufficient for 1.5 to 2 days based on usage, for the first time I do not have to worry on the battery. Even at 25%, am assured of a few hours
- Camera: Rear cameras awesome, front camera is good.
- Fingerprint scanner: Amazing touch sensitivity
- Bigger screen
- Cost: At 14.99K, its the best phone. Value for money.

Dislike:
- Performance: The phone is a touch slower in response. It does matter a bit.
- Samsung apps: Frankly very much unnecessary

I really like this phone. Samsung has done a great job with creating this product at very efficient price. The best thingh about this mobile is the battery backup that is amazing when it is used for watching video. Screen quality is off charts when compared to other devices. There is a bit lack of performance when it comes to gaming, but we can enjoy every high end game in medium quality at a very affordable price. Camera is verg good when it comes to picture. As I'm a traveler i really like the battery life when capturing videos and images. The fast changing is good too, not so fast but not bad for a 6000 mah battery. I would suggest this to those person who like to travel or who forgets charging there phone.

What this phone lacks is the knox protection and Samsung's private space called secure folder.

Purchased 10 days ago. After 10 days of use following are my reviews of specifications:
1. Camera:
  • Rear Camera:- Nice for the budget value,
  but not nice as of Samsung brand name.
  • Front Camera:- Nice in comparison with
  other Samsung phones
2. Processor and Touch: Processing is great and touch is also very good.
3. Battery: The best part of this phone is its battery life. Can work without draining for 24+ hours even if Wifi, GPS, Bluetooth, Mobile Data, Screen Rotation and Dolby Atmos is turned on for all the time. Also charging is fast but not fatser than other phones in same budget.
4. Fingerprint Sensor: Good, but not better than compared to Xiaomi phones.
5. Look:- Oppal Black is the best color for this phone fllowed by Pearl White. It's slim, light weighted.
6. Screen and Display: With sAmoled, it's already the best display phone in the market, but since fingerprint sensor is at the back, the feel is not the same. Display is amazing and you'll enjoy the videos and games
Samsung's brand value is the most preferred thing for this phone as you'll get better service than other phones.
Overall: 4.3*/5 because of Camera and Fingerprint Sensor

This is one of the best smart phone from Samsung (under budget phones segment).
1) Build quality: Using this phone without back cover and not facing any problems yet. Grip is good and non slippery.
2) Battery: The battery life is awesome and doesn't feel heavy in hand, even though with 6000mah battery. Battery backup is good, once fully charged can run whole day. Takes around 2:30 hours to get fully charged.
3) Display is just next to perfect. It's 6.4 super amoled display. Has natural and vivid displays to choose from.
4) Performance: Again Samsung has introduced a class apart product in this segment. No problems with app opening time or RAM management. Superb for playing games. Played PubG in HDR mode. No heating issues as such.
5) Camera : Triple camera with 48 megapixel main camera, 2nd 8 megapixel camera (wide angle mode) and 3rd 5 megapixel camera which is for depth sensor. Dynamic range and white balance is very good. Front camera is of 16 megapixel. I guess the front camera can get better. Little dull pics (sharpness missing). Videos are very stable while walking also.
6) Call quality: Call quality has no issues. Loud and clear call quality. No problems faced.

Summary: Super value Smart phone from Samsung in this range. Must buy mobile in this segment, without any tension.

Phone is good in every thing except the basic and must need thing 'network connectivity'. It has very poor network coverage. I tried the same sim in other company phone, where network is full and in this phone network only 1 or 2 bar and fluctuating too much. Otherwise the phone is supuerb. But it could be best if network coverage improved.

One of the worst product from Samsung. Only battery is good. Firstly phone is lagging for most of the times. ... if it goes into deep sleep mode (I.e. when u are not using it for long) both the finger print and face recognition struggle. Even the display to start takes huge amount of time. Seems like you are using 5 year old phones..
The one ui also crashes. At least once in a day!!
Camera images are over processed as images look little out of shape compared to other phones.  Most of the times gives a yellowish tinge unnecessarily.
Better not to buy.  I always thought Chinese brands like realms, oppo and redmi cannot be trusted, to my disappointment these phones even if it one year old models are performing better than this. Till date I have been using samsung only..but this one has made me rethink..

Samsung M30S is one of the Greatest Phone at This Price Range. Currently No other Phone gives it a Tough Competition Under 20k. Its Camera , Fingerprint Sensor , Face Lock Sensor, Battery , Premium Look All made it a Beast Phone at this Price. Even it has 6k mAh battery Still its wait is not that much .

Camera :-

It has Triple Rear Camera which Helps it capture wide angle photos and Night Mode photos with Each. It also have Slow motion and Hyper Slow motion Video Recording Feature which Add more Power to its camera. It also Have Artificial Emoji feature for it's Camera , You can Make your own Face emoji with it.

Battery :-

Its 6k mah Battery Made it the best Phone For Long Day used and For Gaming Also. You can Use Your Phone Whole day By Just Charging it Once. It gets Fully Charged within 2-3 hours with its Fast 15w charger that Comes with it in its box. Even with 6k mah batterry the wait of this phone is not that much. It Feels very Light according to its battery Capacity.

Gaming :-

I think For Gaming it's Best Phone under this Range. It Provides You Optimized Performance. Gives you Longer Battery to Play Game without sticking at one place for Charging your Mobile while Gaming. It Gives you Inbuilt Button to Record your Gaming With just a One click. There is Recording button placed near Recent tabs button while Gaming you can Record Screen Recording with it. There are many other option Also. The Gaming Experience is Very Smooth Either its PUBG or Ashpalt 9 . Overall Here Also it wins in Best Phone Under 20k.

Display :-

Its Display Gives a Premium Look to its Design. Even You're Playing Full HD videos Its gives View Like a 4k Video. You Can Find this type of Display only in Premium Phones at Very High Cost.

Wifi :-

You will get Fast wifi Speed in it Like You get in a PC. I surf internet in other phone also with Same wifi and Found that it has Nearly Double speed if Wifi than that.

Overall I am Fully Satisfied with this Phone at this Price. Plus I am getting Support from Samsung which is one of the best company in the world for its customer service. Plus Great Experience and Features at Lower Price. You can Go with it Without any Hesitation.

The promised features for Samsung M30s are really fascinating. But does it really keep them? Here is what I have experienced so far using the phone for 7 days :

1. Charging : full charge in 2 hours 35 minutes or more, sometimes 1% in 3 minutes, charger and phone both heating
2. The battery back up :  less than a 4000 mah battery, not acting like a 6000 mah battery phone, keeping screenlight 15% okay otherwise battery-draining
3. Camera images : image quality no way 48 mega pixel, Change in colour, blurry images on zoom, difference in colour when in wide-angle view, selfie images not up to the mark
4. Camera videos : video recording nice, better than capturing images.
5. Display : nice, great experience while watching YouTube videos
6. Processor : fast and nice
7. Screentouch : very comfortable and smooth
8. Network speed : nice, lack of network-speed meter
9. Sound : volume enough for use, lack of bass quality
10. Sound recording : very nice, no noise found in recording
11. Build quality : very nice, back panel in opal-black colour charming, required back-cover protection, feeling good in hand
12. Network : good

  I wanted this phone only because of its monster battery-capacity, I find myself not satisfied at all. I don't know why the battery is not up to the mark. I can't say if there is any difference in the battery back-ups of this phone's 4GB ram &amp; 6GB ram versions. I hope my honest and unbiased review will help customers here, Amazon India and Samsung for their further actions. Thank you!

I'd like you all to pay attention to each and word that's been described here.

Talking about the phone it has got very thin bezels and ppi per inch is very good when you look at the dynamic range of colours in the screen. It feels very premium to use this phone.

Starting with the power pack performance which is being powered by the 6000 Mah battery🔋 it lasts 1 day and 20 hours for me as I use rest it all depends on your usage but if you play heavy games and watch movies continuously it won't disappoint you. You have my word for it.
It also charges fast approximately in an hour plus 30 min and it has got the lastest processor Exynos 9611 which doesn't lag and has a quick response in using it.

Camera oh my good I was so fantasized to use it 48 MP with the main camera then also you got the ultrawide lens and depth sensor to get your portrait photos with the blur background. You'll love it using .
Also the camera has various modes like food, night mode, live focus, photo, video, hyperlapse, slow motion, superslow motion. You'll definitely like it Changing the mode according to your convenience.

Coming to fingerprint scanner and the face unlock are working on with the blazing fast speed it will unlock within seconds you'll hardly imagine the delay in using this.

Now the screen size is also big to watch movies and get a cinematic view of it. You'll just love Samsung for this phone.

At last but not the least the Dolby Atmos sound in headphones oh my goodness this phone is ultimate love. What a person needs here is present without giving a second thought. 🥰🥰

The three things which I basically look in buying the new phone.
1. Battery
2. Camera
3. Sound

And this phone has all the three with an impeccable performance you'll just feel like some superpower in your hand.
This is just flawless the M in M30s should be magnificent and marvelous and many other words that describe it like using the best phone of Samsung.

Thanks Samsung for this. I don't feel like I wasted a penny here but I feel like my money has been utilised in good product which is simply flawless.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

Power mode is customize pretty good to save more power.
Emergency mode was so useful....when we in trouble
Performance was so smooth
Easy to carry you not feel weight of 6000mah battery
Charger cable was good high quality

Unlike points :
It made of full plastic ( coz of battery  weight) easily scarch if any sharp items there not the coins and keys.

Sim and memory  card tray was so delicate if u press little hard it might broke..

In box you can't find screen protector and back case , earphones.

Charger cable was small might be a meter length

Always display (ADOs) video/ live was not in loop after some time it freeze at a point

Camera  was ok for the price 7/10 ( night camera must have to improve)

Earphones Jack female was at charger port.. not comfortable some times (my feeling)

My charge pin was little  loose maybe  for devices I don't know

Game play was awesom in low graphics if u kept high graphics you get some heating issues

This mobile mainly for Indians  but why Samsung didn't done input support  for all languages (only English, hindi and marathi available) and for all languages message readability support was there.

decreasing font size is available but not app size

This are my likes and dislikes

I bought this phone in the exchange of my old phone redmi 4(3487rs) exchange price. Thanks Amazon for extra 10% SBI credit card discount.. So finally I got this phone in 9560rs price .
I am reviewing this phone after 4 days of hard usage.
Phone is awesome..
Start with pros.
1.Display - mind boggling. Love the super amoled display...very much better than ips display...watching videos is so pleasing my eyes(10/10)
2.Battery - it's really on go monster. Massive
6000mah ...must say really great battery. Just
loved it. (10/10)
3.Rear camera - superb HD quality like DSLR.. in night...it also did a brilliant job.. great picture quality..and  After on the flash light ..its capture best clear and coloured photos..but really a great camera quality...i am very happy to choose this phone. THANKS SAMSUNG.  (9.9/10)
4.Audio quality - in 3.5MM Jack- mind blowing. (10/10).
5.performance- smoothly gameplay...pubg play with HDR in highest settings. (9.5/10)
6. Fingerprint reader- smoothly work (9.5/10)
7. Face unlock did a great job (9/10).
8. Call quality is very good and clear.

Cons.
1.built quality - not up to the mark..back is made out of plastic..so when u press the side of the phone...produce some crackling sound. So please buy a back cover for safety (7.5/10)
2.front camera- not good but also not that bad.. in day(sunlight)- capturing clear photos..in night- not like as 16mp ...its like 8mp.. I think it's better in my previous phone redmi 4. But could be better  in next updates. (8/10).
3.App lock- no inbuilt applock like my redmi 4 ..I hope it's fix in the updates. But still not happy.
4.back cover should be provided in the box.
5.phone Speaker is not that good...its produced very thin sound. which i don't like. (7.5/10).

 the Amazon delivery is too good...
Got my phone exchange smoothly ..
Thanks Samsung.

Been using this phone since I first got it within a day of ordering from Amazon prime sale, and I consider myself eligible to write a review of this worthy phone so here are the pros &amp; cons.

1) Battery : MASSIVE, and I can't stress it enough, but it has a massive battery which keeps the phone going for far too long. It often comes as a shock to me when after a long day I check the battery percentage and see it at 56% !!

2) Camera : A brilliant camera setup, and my favourite wide angle lens works like a charm. So if you're into cinematic images and want to include more into your pictures then m30s' wide angle will be very helpful. Megapixels and all the bling hardly matters.

3) Screen : A viewing experience that comes second to none. Watching netflix and HD videos in the dark become so easy on the eye. The blacks vanish out and the colors are a treat to the eye. The touch is also super efficient and you can change it in the settings. Night mode &amp; always on is a bonus.

4) Price point : After adding all the discounts and promos I got it for Rs. 11,600 so this was the smartest buy ever in the history of smartest buys.

Other than those, the processor is fast enough for my day to day activities, PUBG is buttery smooth without any framedrops at playable settings, and one UI just makes using this phone an enriching experience.

For cons I'd say refresh rate is one thing that might sometimes cause some disturbance when you scroll fast while reading something. That's all that I noted during my time with the phone &amp; I'd definitely suggest people to go for the Monster which is the Samsung m30s.

The brand new M30s is a class above the all from the most trusted brand SAMSUNG, this is my 3rd device from the Samsung stable and they are the best. I have used other manufacturer devices too but have always adored the samsung phones.
The pros:
1. Looks are great, the phone is stunning
2. The android OS on this one gets full marks
3. The screen colors are bright and the adaptive display works effectively
4. The battery size is massive and packs upenough juice for 2 days
5. Connectivity is gr8
6. The finger as well as face recognition works brilliantly
7. Great price, this phone has everything one woukd need, Samsung, good job.

Cons:
With bigger battery, it takes long to recharge but thats ok since 6k mah battery is good for 2 days plus with normal usage.

Phone is getting heat up.
Phone rear camera quality is very poor.
Speaker is also not good compare to its price.
Phone body is not good. Back glass made in plastic.
I expected much from this mobile. Got Android Pie with One UI 1.5  Let me share with you my experience; .

At first the phone was working fine. Within 10 days, the performance started degrading. Phone shows intermittent issues. GPU rendering of  PubG even on medium Graphics is horrible. My old 3 GB RAM with Snapdragon rendered way better that this phone. Fingerprint sensor not frequently but  sometimes takes 3-4s. Not worth taking this phone even if given at half phone.

Asked for return from Amazon, they are asking for video proof for intermittent issues. Game rendering issue is not an issue as per them. So logically what they expect me to do is record video for every second I use the phone so that I can somehow record the issues that I'm facing. Didn't expect such service from Brand like Amazon that too for Prime members. I wish I could return this phone

Received today only.. Using it for last half and hour and it is going more than fine..
Was using Iphone 6 and let me tell u this phone at 17k is priceless..
I bought this just because of battery but impressed with the sound and clarity and touch is far better than other phone of any range till 35k and u r getting this in just half.
Though I am not a photo wala guy so camera is not important for me.
Being a professional, this phone can surely make a good impression as Samsung is a brand and other phones have sarcastic impressions like oppo vivo mi..

I am loving this new toy..

My son gifted me Samsung M30s. I have been now using it for more than two weeks and I am extremely satisfied with phone .
The phone has a beautiful display and it's also quite handy to work with . Well probably everyone would have talked about the battery , I will reiterate the same. It reminds me about the battery life of old nokia phones. It's that good.
I think they can improve in the camera dept. a bit ..
The phone's thickness is a bit on the higher side but the weight is not noticeable despite the 6000mAh battery.
It's a good all rounded phone for people with screen display and battery life as their highest priority.

Bought this phone in the great indian festival. This was a great deal. delivered very fast by Amazon. There is no lag. Camera quality is great. fingerprint is very fast. has an enormous 6000mah battery that lasts very long with the optimized Exynos processor. sAmoled display is good. (but slightly inferior to original A series phones). Has  dual band Wifi. Dual Volte.
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars

Pros:
Design: Samsung has done an incredible job with the design and its weight distribution, it doesn't feels like you are holding a 6000mAh smartphone.
Display: excellent display in the competition.
Cameras: it takes above average photos in ample amount of light
Battery: excellent battery life. It can easily get you through the day.
Fast charging: 15 watt fast charging which charge your phone in 2 hours and 50 minutes approximately.

Cons:
1. Biggest con yet, no haptic feedback still in the budget smartphone lineup, please Samsung hear us and bring back the haptic feedback.
2. The stock camera's night mode sucks
3.  I have one complain with the colours though, the sapphire blue colour seems dull to me. I'd prefer a matte finish polycarbonate back instead of the glossy one.
4. 18watt fast charging is more appreciable. Which is not the case though.

I used to be an apple user from very long time and I was looking to replace it with some interesting device in a budget. I took Samsung M10 M20 for my parents when they launch. I was wishing to take M30 when it was launched. Now when I got to know that another upgrade coming as M30S that fulfill every requirement of mine from looks, usage to user experience. I am 27 years old IT professional, I have started getting monotonous and matured feeling from apple gold color. Now I wanted to feel bit youthful so i have ordered this Sapphire Blue color as it looks quite attractive and different from other OVM devices since it composed two shade green &amp; blue and even some glitter onto it which bring some shine to device on handy.
For me, apart from looks other practical usage constraints matters too whether its using camera, touch experience, battery backup, screen size resolution. Camera is decent, features are good and watching experience is great. Most important I don't need to charge my phone daily even on full day usage with having 6000mah battery into it. I'm so glad and satisfied that I moved to Samsung and took this monster device. I am easily doing my daily online tasks with it. Hereby I would recommend it to all who's looking to get a phone is 10-15k budget with long battery Backup, great look and performance.

Camera seems to be 12/16 mpx not up to the mark

Things to like for this phone:
1. Monster battery and excellent battery life. 6000 mAh is just soo powerful and effective.
  The quick charger charges the phone faster than you can think.
2. No lag or hanging of phone even if multiple applications are in the background.( I've run over 15 in the background )
3. Front as well as Rear camera are doing ga WOW! job even in low lighting or artificial lighting.
4. Screen and the Fingerprint Reader response time is just SO QUICK!
5. The back of the phone is of supreme quality and does not make the slip off the hands of the user.
6. There's no hybrid sim slot. So, you can use 2 nano sims and 1 micro SD card at the same time. (Many Redmi phones miss out this feature).
7. The phone has a lot of options for the ease of access to the user such as gestures, and what not.
8. The camera also has many options such as super slo-mo video, slo-mo video, panorama, wide angle photo, night mode, etc. There's also a super stability mode for videography which makes the video real stable.

Only thing to dislike about this phone is that it does not have any protection but you'll receive acko screen protection for 1 year (I've got it) anyway. So it balances it out. Even though the phone won't slip out easily even if you have a loose grip.

Overall inspection of the phone proves it as one of the best phone to purchase this 2019.

I hope this review did good to the one who is thinking of buying the phone.

Genuine review after one week usage:

camera 8/10
fingerprint 8/10
build quality 9/10
battery 10/10
processor 10/10
screen 10/10
speed 10/10
sound 10/10
Network 5/10
Charging 10/10

This is the best budget smartphone under 14k price segment, totally all rounder. Without a single negative thought/review go ahead and buy it.

Note: no problem at all in the smartphone but there is a fake deal/offer mentioned on amazon.
1) There is no cashback of Rs.1000 during great Indian sale from Amazon.
2) Even there is no Airtel double data offer. Even if you insert the sim and recharged it within 48hrs of the activation.) No proper response on about this offer from amazon or airtel.

Nice phone but as per Sumsung Advertisement  Not upto the mark
1. 6000MAH battery  very good life true Monsters
2. Fingerprints  sensor  not good
I am using redmi note7 pro, its fingerprints sensor ooossooom too much better than M30s
3. Camera decent quality not upto the mark as per Samsung Advertisement . Not Go Monsters camera
A. Camera quality not good after clicking the picture when zoom on the subject, totally unsatisfying.
B. Night mood Just ok not upto the mark
C. Wide angle camera ok again when you zoom in not satisfied.
D. Selfy  camera Ok
E. Live  focus not upto the mark, many times H deduction not good.

E. Super steady  mood Ok
4. Sound, Dolby Atoms, only on the phone just for highlighting the product for marketing  purpose only
I am used Lenovo  phone Dolby  Atmos  that  was true Dolby  atmos. For good sound quality I have power AMP music player but in m30s not good at all.

As its tag line claims (Go monster), Its really monster. Wonderful battery, camera,User interface and loaded with all the features i was eagerly looking for.

This is simply SUPERB! pearl white is quite attractive,Battery is successfully running good; 40% left after 2 days of charging.

Best  Camera, Dual4G support ,Inbuilt auto call recording feature, dollby atmos sound, always on display makes it real good.

This phone is most deserving for the people who like best features in a genuine price point.

Thanks amazon for prompt delivery.

UPDATE AFTER 3 MONTHS

Used 3 phones with 5000 Mah battery which given batter backup than this. Camera is pathetic. Wide angle snaps comes as 3rd shots. Interface is good. but over all very average phone. People like me who wanted to move away from Chines phone, this is very poor experience from SAMSUNG.

Firslty, The Look of the phone is very cool and attractive. It feels good. I have Opal Black colour which is amazing rather than pearl white or blue.

One of the best thing i saw in M30s is 6000mAh battery is awesome. Three days ago i charged my phone and now i still reviewing the M30s( Opal Black ) from last charge. Now still my battery percentage is remaining 36%. This Monstrous Battery makes M30s awesome.

#Camera Quality
I like the water drop notch camera. It has 48MP rear camera and i take some shots which is not very good. But it's quality is ok not very good. It takes wide range shots. And i like the quality of front camera of M30s.

#Storage
Storage is enough for me 4GB and 64 GB.

#Face lock and Fingerprint sensor
Face recognition is very quick like in A50. And fingerprint is also quick to sense to unlock the phone.

I got the latest and cool features in this mobile at cheap price @13999. It's not very expensive. I got the delivery within 2 days.

I'm very happy to buying this product. Because it full fill all my expectations.

My point of view after using the phone for 3 days

- Display is the best part of the phone

- CPU is good enough for multimedia experience, I don't play games so I'm quite satisfied with the performance, it's comparable to Snapdragon 665 (the cores A73 and A53 are old, should have used A75 and A55), the only advantage Exynos 9611 has over Snapdragon 665, 675, 710/712 is that it uses four high performance cores(A73) than two on SDs but SDs use newer A75 or A76 cores for high performance and A55 for lower tiers.

- Battery: For me lasted for around 1.5 days after moderate use, was expecting a better performance, charging speed is disappointing, phone should have supported 20W+ fast charging. As with any other phones, the battery endurance would go down as time progresses, so in a long term, expect 1 day backup.

- Loudspeaker is not so audible and clear, you can get better sounding phones in similar price segment, but I don't use loudspeakers much so I'm okay with it.

- Audio output through headphone jack is good but could've been better, volume is a bit low, (Tested with SoundMagic E11C with Powermap music player and Dolby Atoms enabled), wireless audio quality is average (this is where Snapdragons truly excel with their aptX codecs)

- Battery drains faster than expected when Always-On is enabled.

- Camera quality: Very disappointing camera performance, photos are not as sharp but colors are natural. Wide angle photo comes badly with barrel distortion around the edges. Video recordings are good (normal and wide), super stead is great. Very poor low-light performance (both video and stills), poor front-facing camera quality, I'm hoping it's not a hardware defect but a software issue and will be fixed in future update(s), I have seen better photos in various video reviews than what I'm getting.

- Network reception is poor, even older phones have better reception than this, But it could be a result of low SAR value..

- Fingerprint: slower than competitors, sometimes it fails to detect and unlock, another drawback is that only 3 fingerprints can be registered.

- Call quality: Voice clarity could've been better but it's quite loud, disappointingly the sound leaks through the back-panel (around fingerprint scanner, can also feel the sound vibrations) if the volume is set to high, so a person sitting next to you can hear the person on call.

- OneUI - UI is light weight and looks good, Night(dark) mode is really great, but needs more features, I would like to have data speed shown in status bar. Split screen view is not available, should also include app-lock feature.

Hope much of the issues gets fixed through updates.

tl:dr;
If your requirement is majorly web surfing, multimedia, good batter backup, phone calls, then it's a good phone for this target audience.
Not for high performance users, gamers and photography.

Samsung Galaxy M30s  is great value for money deal with awesome camera and the night mode feature is icing on cake. The phone is not heavy considering it's massive 6000 Mah battery, its use interface is lighter than others, battery lasts for around 1 and half day but also takes around 3 hours for full recharge.

Pros-
1 sAmoled display-flagship display at budget price.
2Battery- easily lasts for 1-1.5days if you are heavy user &amp; even for 2days if you are moderate one.
3 despite of monster battery the phone feels light weight in hand.
4 Camera performs good in daylight.
Cons-
1 polycarbonate plastic back is cheap material. It gives crackling sound even when you press it gently
2 the fingerprint sensor &amp; face sensor works little slow compare to other phones in this category.
3 camera struggles in night &amp; low light conditions. Front camera gives very soft images..details are missing in it.
4 Charger could have been given faster in charging 6000mah battery. It take almost 2:30 hrs in charging from 0-100
5 Samsung should provide at least back case with it's devices.

As samsung phones are best for middle class. It has very specific features. I have used Samsung Galaxy S3 before it. Since then I am a great fan of Samsung products. Battery life is best for audio and video calls. Call sound is very clear. Camera quality is better. Fingerprint reader is very sensitive.
  For all, it's the best phone in range of 15000. If anyone has the budget upto 15000, I will suggest him/her Samsung Galaxy M30s.
  All of its features provided are working properly. It's a quality of Samsung only. Features could be available in other phones but they did not work properly

1.battery life: lasts 2 days on a single charge with light to moderate usage(chrome,youtube,whatsapp,calls)
2.display: display on the phone looks awesome. Colors,brightness..everything about the display is great.
3.video: video quality is good with great stabilisation

Cons:
1.camera: both front and rear camera punch under their weight in terms of quality. Hopefully future software updates fix this
2.sound: sound quality from the headphones are good, but the loudspeaker can do a lot better. Sound gets distorted at high volume..which is weird because this phone is a lot quieter than its competitors even at its highest volume.
3.fingerprint sensor: not a con as such but expected it to be a lot faster for a phone that has a sensor on the back in 2019(there are phones that has fingerprint sensor under the display with faster response at this price range).
4.build: plastic build. Looks cheaper than the glass-back phones. But better if you prefer durability as glass breaks.

Hit or miss:
1.UI: OneUI is great to use. Like the way it flows. But the phone comes with a bulk of pre-installed apps few of which can't be uninstalled.
2.charger: 15w watt charger is provided which takes a 2 and a bit hours to charge from 0 to 100. I am fine with it as the phone has 6000mah battery. Not a dealbreaker but still..

Excellent phone for the price.
Screen size and amoleed display is excellent.
Camera quality very good especially the video recording and additional features.
Processor is pretty decent and fast, no lags.
Best feature which no other phone can beat is the battery life. Lasts easily with extensive use for 2full days. Thanks for the fast charger.
  Overall this is the best phone l have used.
  Samsung done a great job.
  Highly recommend it.

First of all I would  like to thanks Amazon for fast delivery of product.
Now thanks to Samsung for launching  this amazing mobile in this price range with very good features..
M30s mobile's look is amazing and stylish.
Touch screen is very smooth like butter.
Good battery backup.
Still mobile is light weight after having 6000mah battery..
Sound quality  is also very good.
But little bit disappointed with camera..its not look like a 48 megapixel..it should be more clear if u have 48 megapixel camera in your hand..
Last but not the least that I am feeling very proud
that this mobile is Made in INDIA not Made in China..

The phone is simply perfect!
I'll cover all the aspects of the phone one by one in detail.
First of all the Super Amoled screen is very immersive. The brightness of this phone is on another level. Refresh rate too is satisfactory. I compared my phone with One Plus 7 and my phone certainly won in almost every aspect.
The second feature which attracts everyone was its humongous battery life. 6000 mAh! And Samsung certainly kept its promise. The battery can go on and on doesn't matter if you play Pubg or any other game or just use your phone for calling or photography or anything, you can use it whole day after one charge. The fast charging too is very good and it charges the phone at a pretty decent speed(my phone won over One Plus 7 in this aspect too). The system GUI is very much user friendly and Samsung keeps giving security and software updates. The back mounted fingerprint sensor is faster than any Realme device and quite reachable too as compared to Samsung's earlier models. The camera quality is just amazing and it offers a whole lot of variations in your photos and videos. You can record slo-mo and even super slow motion videos from this device. It automatically edits and gives a clean output which is presentable and eye catching too. The photo quality and wide angle lens is quite impressive. Selfie camera too is satisfiable, providing numerous features to take a pic. Taking about the processor, it gives maximum output, the phone really NEVER EVER HANGS! Pubg or any other heavy game runs smoothly on this device. No heating issues after 7 hrs of continuous playing(its battery literally lasted even more!), No lagging issues, no frame drop, Pubg ran in full HD quality and without any issues. The phone is completely packed with the beloved 3.5mm audio jack and type C. I don't know how Samsung managed to put all this in a phone and even after that kept its  price under 20K. According to me no MI or One Plus phone can compete even nearly with this phone, Apple is anyway out of the race. On a scale of 1-100 I'll give this phone 110 marks! Super satisfied by its performance. Loved it completely. Would strongly suggest to me peer group or anyone about to buy a phone. An amazing work done by Samsung and also Amazon as I got it the 3rd day after delivery even after I bought it in a flash sale. Delighted to have this phone with me. ^_^

I have been a regular customer of Samsung products and honestly I was a little disappointed till the launch of A series and M series. And with M series, Samsung is back in Game.

Firstly, let me talk about the features and the price range. To be honest, when compared to other companies the price is a little high but not that much.! It is Samsung and it has to maintain the brand value.

DESIGN of M30s is its biggest asset. The mobile fits in your hand but a weight might be an issue to few. The phone comes in three different and unique colours which are meant to be displayed without back covers or cases. But, it's a mandatory to have a protection for your mobile on front and back to avoid damage.

And the biggest attraction is the BATTERY. 6000mah should be sufficient for around 1 and half day usage on Wifi and very close to a day usage on Mobile Data. And if you don't use Wifi or Mobile Data, it should give you atleast 2 days.

I always loved cameras of Samsung. Be it the first generation touch phones or latest smartphones, Samsung has its unique touch for camera. The 48mp camera does the job exactly as the demos. And just like any other Samsung phone in A series and M series, the camera still lacks the low light efficiency. But, it is a little better in M30s. The 16mp front camera is not impressive when compared to the rear camera, but functions well.

The ram usage is something you need to keep an eye on. Inhave seen all the variants of A series and M series. The ram usage is close to 2.5gb in idle state in 4gb version and 2.8gb in 6gb version. Samsung automatically runs a few apps and that is the reason for this. So, better choose 6gb version.

The CPU is pretty fast just like all other phones in the series. The sAMOLED display is good. The storage is sufficient that you don't need a memory card to store data. There is no network signal issue.

If you are a Samsung lover, this product must be in your pocket and you will be proud to be an owner of M30s.

If you are looking for camera feature, the rear camera will satisfy you but the front doesn't. If you are looking for battery, no other smartphone can beat this. If you are looking for performance, this is one of the greatest products made in the history and you can get this without a second thought.

NO HEATING ISSUES AT ALL.

PS: This review is being written after 3 and half days of usage.

This phone has lots of genuine problem.
1) Not very user friendly. When you play video on youtube, netflix or amazon, the video never goes for real full screen mode. The icons to go back and other options will still be visible, so a very bad video viewing experience.
2) Camera quality is really very poor.
3) Even though this phone's USP is battery, but still the phone battery life is weak. After full charge it only lasts for not more than 12 hours.
5) Headphone jack, and speaker port are kept at very unconvinient place. They should either be kept above or on sides of phone. Right now they are below the phone, so if you want to talk to someone by keeping phone on your chest while sleeping, the speaker is blocked. Same for headphone, you can not view videos comfortably , if the phone is kept upright on your chest and the headphone jack is pressed on the bottom.
 Overall a bad phone by samsung as always. Very weak build quality.

Pros_
1.battery-beast..if u are a heavy user n gamer it easily lasts for more than a day...for average user 1 n half day easily
2.super amoled display-best viewing experince
3.camera-most of the bad reviews i see are about camera...i too felt the same initially...bt the thing is that by default the camera is not on 48mp...there is 48mp option in camera...by default it clicks 4000×3000 resolutions pics,when u change to 48mp it gives 8000×6000 sharper images n u can clearly obeserve the clarity...n u can keep the camera on 48mp mode always
Rear camera is great in outdoor n daylight conditions,good in lowlight
4.processor is smooth
5.audio output through earphones n blueooth devices...thanq to dolby atmos feature

Cons
1.pubg hangs a lot in hdr settings n device heats...handles well in smooth n ultra settings...i am absolutely ok with it
2.front camera is good in daylight bt could have been better in lowlight condtions...tip-set beauty mode on intensity 1 r nill which gives natural n sharp images...by default intensity is 2

For those who are complaing about design-dude it has a 6000 mah battery,if it comes with glass back then u will be carrying a dumbell in ur hand instead of a phone...anyways i always use a desinger hard case so doesnt matter if its a plastic r glass back

For those who are complaining about not getting back case r earphones,atleast go through what u get in the box before buying anything...saying so they should have provided atleast backcase but i m not complaining coz i bought knowing dat case wouldnt be there

Overall satisfied with the product

Average camera, very bad screen, if you compare the resolution with 720p old phones then you will find out that those phones have better clarity and colors. Its only advantage is that it is amoled so it looks vibrant and good from a distance and under the sun. If you watch videos then this one is not for you. Also almost 70-80% models are deffective in such a way that many times it has network connectivity issues. So there is a very high chance you will get one of those and the company will not change it. Looks of the phone are also bad. And also dont dare to drop it.
The only advantage is battery, sound quality, audio output and other samsung features.
If you still want to buy it.
Good luck

Cheapest quality mobile by Samsung.
Network related issue if changing location frequently. Need to refresh network settings every time.
Camera quality is not meeting the expectation as Samsung advertised.
 Face recognition is not at all secure because there is no Irish scan . One can unlock your mobile when you are sleeping or by showing your photo.
Processing is slow and some application is getting struck sometimes.

I take some time to review. Because i should  give you right information. Before reading this review you should keep price in yr mind.
FIRST IMPRESSION- i think its best premium look in this budget. Pearl white is premium colors look and design is great. I ensured you. U fall in love if you like white color.
AFTER USING 1 WEEK- i try to test every corner of this  phone and i found.
Pros - Battery=  is really monster, Hard using i got 2 day battery  life. If you are a traveler go for it.
Display - you know Samsung is not compromised in Display as always grea3 display with blue light filter options for long time users. Super  amoled display . It' is  bigger  than mi A3 . H×w .Love it.
Processor = Exynos 9611 , i hv not compare to any other phone but according to my uses i got great speed.
Finger print speed  is fast.
Face unlock is also fast. You cant open this phone in close eyes
Camera - i give 4 out of five 5,
Cons- you didn't get phone case and earphone in the box but according to budget its not disappointing.
Camera = i will give 4 out of 5, selfie camera  is great.
Fast charging &amp; No any heating issue till now.
 So finally = overall my experience  with this phone is awesome ,great option in this budget , go for it.
 MONSTER EXPERIENCE

writing this review after  using this phone for a week.
its the best phone in this price range, and the only phone with 6000 mah in this price bracket.

I got 4gb/64gb variant for RS 11500 only in Amazon sale.

Coming to its pros

1) 6000 mah battrey ( lasts for two days if you are not a gamer else depends on you usage)

2) primary camera is 48megapixels which actually takes amazing detailed images and front camera is good enough for blurred background shots.
it also has inbuilt beautify feature, which you can adjust while taking selfies.

3) Triple camera setup is perfect, specially the wide angle camera is surprisingly good.

and one feature which no other phone is providing in this range is, you can also take wide angle videos from the wide angle camera which is really cool.

4) Night mode is good and take vibrant and well lit photos at night.

5) With Super amoled FHD+ , trust me this screen is the best in this price range.

6)  Exynos 9611 processor is pretty good enough for games like PUBg / Asphalt etc.
you wont regret you decision.

7) Finger print reader is adequately fast.

8) I personally like the white color variant.
And good m30s Is offering that.

cons
Nothing as such, as per this price range.
i will update if anything comes up.

Bought this phone a week ago the 6gb+ 125gb version.
A lot of pros to go along with the cons with one week of usage.
Pro:
1.  Doesnt lag. Exynos 9611 processor is quite fast, especially while playing PUBG. Seamless flow that i quite like.
2. Battery backup is pretty sweet. works almost a day and a half with me playing PUBG and watching prime all day long.
3. Screen quality and resolution is also amazing.
4. The phone doesnt heat up as significantly as i expected accordig to the way i used my phone.
Cons:
1. Even though the camera specification is very high, it takes a little longer than i expected to process the image.
2. Front camera resolution is thoroughly 3/5.
3. The immediate issue i faced was with my charger adopter overheating whilst charging the phone. even though fast charging is enabled, i am not sure if the adopter is made quite well enough. half the time im worried that it might melt considering how hot it gets.
4. The OS is very outdated and clunky in appearance and would be better if Samsung switched to Android one.

Overall: The phone is very solid and for performance oriented people is a good buy.

Don't go behind the rumors. This phone is very good and it's features are amazing.
I am satisfied with its performance specially the battery backup and really i love its live focus mode in camera.
I continuously using the phone into my field work and all day net is on and when i reached my home the battery left 50-55%.
If you use this for only calling then this phone backup will provide you 2.5 days. I checked it.
My personal opinion, I am giving this phone 95 out of 100.

Excellent  camera phone with good speed and storage capacity. Battery life with normal usage is up to 48hrs...which is great.
Fingerprint sensor is a bit lethargic as it sometimes doesn't work and side button has to be pressed to start the phone.
Slow motion cam recordings are super ..

I've been using this mobile for past one week. Here are the pros and cons according to my experience:
PROS:
1. sAMOLED display is sharp and crisp with very good viewing angles. You can't get much better display at this price point.
2. 6000 mah battery can easily last for two days even for a heavy user. Samsung's background app management is customizable which can further increase your battery life.
3.Widevine L1 certification is present which makes it possible to view hd content on prime and Netflix.
4. Rear camera quality is pretty decent and you get good sharp looking images in day light conditions.
5. Exynos 9611 does a pretty good job in handling day to day activities with ease. Gaming performance is also decent. Pubg isn't well optimized as of now. Battery drain is noticeable while playing pubg. But COD is well optimized and so are the other games.

CONS:
1. build quality could have been better. Polycarbonate back is not bad but the back case isn't well fit to the mobile. You'll feel clicky sound coming whenever you hold it in the middle. To avoid this you can use a well built case.
2. Speaker sound is very very low. Even at top most volume you feel like you can barely hear the sound.
3. Front camera doesn't produce natural images. It oversaturates the image in every lighting condition.
-----

Overall the phone is good. Battery is outstanding, even after heavy use it stays around 40% to 50% at the EOD. I didn't find fingerprint sensor fast and if we talk about 48 mp camera, it is just above average not so fascinating.
After using it for few weeks the major con which I found is screen auto brightness. They didn't use dedicated auto brightness sensor and use just a camera and it is really very slow. In daylight you have to wait for 20 to 30 second and that is really very irritating.

I order the phone on launch day 28th Sep'19 when the phone was available to Amazon Prime customers. Buying experience was better than the Flash Sale of Mi and other Brands, I was worried the phone will go out of stock within 2mins so was glued to my Amazon phone app since 11.55am itself. I wanted to BUY the Pearl White color but due to some technical error BLUE color was purchased.

 I received the phone on 29th sep'19 morning by 10am, KUDOS to Amazon for it prompt delivery.

I have been using the phone from last 3 days and my review is based on the experience so far.

The phone is extremely handy and you don't feel weight of the phone considering the monster 6000mah battery size. I was pleasantly surprised post unboxing and holding the mobile first time in my hand.  The Best part of the phone has to be it super Amoled display, the display is extremely bright even in sunlight and colors feel real.

Camera performance is mixed , the rear camera take good shots and image quality is good but it's the front facing selfie camera which disappoints as it softens the image and it looks artificial. Selfie camera reminds me of all OPPO VIVO camera memes going around.

Battery backup is good considering the massive battery and it will easily last you 1.5day with heavy usage.

Samsung ONE UI is good but needs still improvement as few basic shortcuts like screenshot in missing in top notifications TAB.

Overall a great value for Money device considering the offer it got on launch as my effetlctive buying price was Rs.11600/- after taking 10% card discount &amp; Rs.1000/- Amazon Pay balance.. it also came with 1 year free screen replacement insurance bundled with it.

First of all ,  I would like to give thanks to Amazon and Samsung both for smart delivery and ultimate smart phone.

Now let’s talk about the phone ..I am giving my review after using this smart phone or explore the device well. So in my perspective , this is the king of budget category phones. Samsung always maintain its legacy of revolutionary ideas in smart way so again Samsung has proven it by this phone ..Samsung M30s mesmerise  you by a 6.4 ‘’ super amoled screen with infinity u display with a rear triple camera setup (depth camera + main camera 48Mp +ultra wide angle camera ) .  Display quality is very impressive &amp; captured photos will blow up your mind ..In camera u will get night mode , portrait mode &amp; ultra wide angle mode which explain a new definition of photography . In front ,it designed with 16mp selfie camera . When I shoot video during running , it mesmerised me by video quality , objects were almost stable . It rules with monster battery (6000mah) with powerful octa core &amp; exynos 9611processor which provides  soothing experience for heavy games &amp; Multi  tasking .. Fingerprint sensor is very decent although face recognition feature is very impressive .

In short , it’s a ultimate phone with  unbeatable qualities so definitely u should experience it ..thanks Samsung ...thanks amazon .

My lovely Samsung Galaxy M30s :

1.  Excellent Camera - clear, bright, vivid pictures, with a multitude of options thrown in.  2.  Excellent audio - leader in its class.  3.  FM Radio with recording facility - a great add-on functionality.  4.  Calendar does NOT have the "Day" (only month option in Menu) - would like this option restored.  5.  Peak brightness @ 420 Knits is fantastic (slightly pinkish tone?) - almost a flagship-type feature !  6.  Processor - value for money.  7.  Dual SIM PLUS dedicated Micro SD Memory Card affords flexibility.  8.  Would have preferred a WIDER Screen (80+ mm ?).  9.  "Business Use" functionality (e.g. DeX) would have made this a truly powerful productivity tool in a palm !  10.  Come 5G, would like my Galaxy M30s to transform and adapt itself to deliver 5G functionality - if and when 5G is set in motion in India.  11.  The SmartSwitch App is a  wordclass App, but the time it takes to sync (my Galaxy Note 8) is intolerably too long- 5-6 hours if not more.  12.  The Samsung Store and Galaxy Store are great sources for shopping for a whole variety of things - truly innovative approach - Congratulations and Compliments !.  13.  have been a "die-hard" Samsung  aficionado : my very first (Year 2011) smartphone was a Galaxy phone.  My tablet is a Samsung.  My TV is Samsung.  My LED Monitor is Samsung.  And I bought my Galaxy Note 8 in the US in Sept. 2017.  And a week ago, I bought my Galaxy M30s through Amazon Festival Sale.

Samsung M30s
Display:- Display is pretty good you have to activate the super amoled dispaly in settings.

Battery:- Battery works great after 12 hrs of complete use (wifi 5hrs) it came to 62%.

Performance:- pretty fast.

Fingerprint and facelock:-fingerprint takes 1sec and the finger should be in middle. Facelock is pretty fast. You get two options in facelock direct homescreen and swipe option.
Sound:- sound is pretty loud.
Touch is good.
Smartlock available.
Back cover isnt that great and colour of phone is not that attractive.
Pubg works smooth.

Camera:- The quality isnt that much. Not able to focus on close objects. Wide angle camera is better than the depth camera. White light changes to green in outside condition as you can see in photos. Flash is too bright for and photos arent good if you are taking close on with flash. Front camera is ok. People  taking lot of selfies should buy the phone after samsung improves camera in the next update. Video quality is good. 48MP camera needs to be improve.
Photos taken above are in wide and depth mode and few in live focus and watch in pro mode. Night mode only increase the intensity. Food mode is nice.

Over all mobile is good. If Samsung  manages to fix the camera in next update this mobile will top for sure.

P.S:-  I'm not  good photographer. But quality of photo is because of phone not my photography

I really really love it! It is almost perfect, the battery is great, the camera is awesome, the display is rich and vibrant looking, and the processor is fairly quick. The problems and complaints that I have with this device are not any major ones, but they include-
1. The battery being fairly bigger than most flagships, doesn't actually last longer than them, though they have faster processors, larger and higher resolution displays and better speakers.
2. The camera is great but lacks capturing detail properly(may be the software).
  That's basically all the complaints that I have.
Again, great phone, and would recommend it to anyone who's on a budget

I am writing this review after using it for more than one week. At this price point this phone is amazing. I should say battery is really a monster.

Let me explain individual points :
Display : It's super amoled. So no doubt display is 5/5.
Camera : we have triple camera setup here. 48 mp gives good detail and wide angle lens also gives a good coverage. Performance of depth camera is also good. Front camera is performing good when u have good lighting. In low lighting if you are taking individual selfies then you have option of display flash and that gives a good.
Performance : this mobile is performing really good in day to day usage.
UI : less customization available. But easy to use that is good.
Battery : that is a real MONSTER.

I love small mobiles so it could have been a complete killer for me if screen size is less than 6 inches.

Excellent Camera, Excellent Display, Excellent Battery Life - all these together with very pleasing looks and comfortable-to-hold weight and build. What more can one expect from a phone at this very attractive price? The convenience of Double 4G SIM operation with a separate Micro SD slot adds a new dimension to the whole package. I am extremely satisfied with this MADE IN INDIA device. Thank you Samsung.

M30s is truly "Iron Man" of Samsung's Galaxy A &amp; M series Avengers family...
Deserves No. 1 position in affordable price range (Rs 10k to 30k).
Loved it Superfast Fingerprint, Stunning camera, Prompt delivery by STPL. I don't need powerbank now, thanks to its monstrous battery.
Basically I purchased it for its Reading mode feature (with 6.4" big screen), and now it is very comfortable for my eyes to read more even in Mumbai's local trains. That's why I'm very proud on my purchase.
All these superiority features makes it to stand out as "Iron Man" phone to beat Thanos (Mi Poco F1 and OnePlus series).
M30s fulfills your every need and heart too. So keep Calm and love Samsung M30s.

Pros: Wide super amoled display gives rich look to the mobile. Battery backup was large enough it stays 2 days from full charge. RAM management also good. Camera quality is ok ok if you need better camera it is not good option. Touch sensitivity is like butter. 2D Black colour gives awesome look.
Cons: It doesn't comes with gorilla glass for screen protection. One touch sleep option is not there. There is no dedicated app for RAM management and clearing cache. Overall nice budget mobile for those don't play games often.

There is a little extra bezel at bottom than is shown in the images.

Touch is not well calibrated. Sometimes despite pressing an icon, their is no response.

UI has lots of bugs, in form of cropped letters, when you increase the font size.

Night photo quality is deplorable.

Ultra wide rear camera has too much distortion. In the front, there is no wide camera. They just crop the picture in normal mode and show the original image in wide mode.

Battery is long lasting. No doubt about that.

Performance wise, I always noticed a lag while playing PUBG even at the lowest resolution. This is really bad for a mid range phone.

This product  is awesome.I would  like to mention  each and every point of this phone starting with the most  important quality of this phone is its battery.
1)Battery life: battery life of this phone is excellent as I use my phone very much and it's not drained  easily.I can explain  through  example that I charge my phone once in morning  then I use it whole  day like play music calls Pubg and many more things  I do then after whole  day I charge at midnight.
I must suggest who wants to get  a phone with good powerful battery  this is the best phone for you.
Camera:- The camera quality  is also excellent as I love to do photography and this phone helps me a lot with excellent focus quality.
Sensors:- sensors are also good.fast and recognizing power  is also fast as well.
Processor:-As I am using  this phone  in very tough  way but it didn't  hang at all so I must say the processor is very powerful.
At last but not the least this phone is the best companion for you if you want a good budget  phone with best quality  battery camera processor and many more thing.

I must suggest  pls go for this phone guys....

I mention the my personal experience in few points.
1. The weight  of the phone which carry 6000 mAh battery  is make my mind awesome.
2. I am really thankful to Samsung  that they also give the Dolby atom sound.
3.camera of this phone is really  smooth  and the large view make the user's more happy than expected.
4. The click in camera is so fast and it captures  the picture in that moment  that user's  want.
5.The slow and super slow motion video features is awesome.
6. The performance  of camera, fingerprint sensors is best in this range of price  phones.
7. The zoom of captured  images  is for better than realme phones.
8. I really  happy that the fingerprint sensor is given in this phone with the all advanced features.
My suggestion.
1. I want to say that no phone is perfect according to demand of user's  minds.
2.the M30s have also needed some improvement specially  in battery  sector.
3. The fully  charge battery  of this phone is gone in just 30 hours use.
4. After that issues, the Samsung  Galaxy M30s is create a history, it is the best phone this given price ever in the electronic device  industry.
Thank you for giving this opportunity and taking  my personal  experience.
Your regards
Vishal Gupta.

Samsung world's second largest phone maker with world's largest mobile phone stateofart plant in India.
State of art features like triple camera, atmos dolby speakers, c charging, amoled screen, huge battery to last you more than two days with heavy usage and the list goes on
Earlier friends use to bring mobile when they came from abroad. Now we send this contemporary model to family members abroad as gift.
Thank you samsung for giving Indian consumer their money's worth by making in India.
Top it all with sapphire blue color.
Friends when they saw said WOW
Like to flaunt it.
Proud to own it.
Amazon thanks for zero% EMI,prompt delivery, competitive pricing for so much of value.
Samsung should standardize and pack all black coloured  stylish back cover, very high quality ear phones, 9H screen protector, PU sleeve passing on value of economies of scale due to bulk sourcing, as value proposition at cost as option to make it single window experience for customers seeking such option.
Excellent Samsung service network in my town and pan India
Thank you Samsung
Keep it up for providing REAL state of the art high end features and specifications at very competitive  price delivering REAL value to Indian consumer.

What is like about this phn is its awesome display which is s-amoled, battery performance which lasts up to 3 days with medium use with single charge, smooth and clean interface design.
What i dislike about this phn is its very slow fingerprint reader it takes about 2-3 seconds to open sometimes. You cant unlock without waking the phn first that i dislike the most.
Rest is good so far. Apart from that fingerprint unlocking issue I'm pretty happy with this phn.
Advice- If you're not a heavy user or hardcore game lover you can go for this phn.

Im not satisfied with this device.  Camera is not up to the mark. Its just like a 16 mega pix cam. And face lock is not that much faster. Apps also responding slow. Build quality is not good. Sound quality also much better. Phone talking voice is also not clear in speaker.  Sensor is very very slow . Over all the device is like below 8k price device.  Touch is also very slow.. Better to avoid this device.

All features are well and good. The quality of camera is good but not upto the expected level other than camera everything ie. Battery, fingerprint reader, internal and external memory, display, processor, android os, etc., is well functioning. Samsung m30s will worth for the price. I also suggested many of my friends to buy this phone because of its good features. I was attracted by its battery feature...

Although the phone has everything good but Samsung left a very serious problem in this model. Signal strength is extremely poor inboththeSIMs. I have compared at the  same location with other mobiles and with same network. I have  never got a signal strength better than  -100db. I have checked in Samsung community.  There are many people facing the same issue.

Recommendation:highly recommended
Review 4.5 star

Definitely this is a Monster.
Fastest device i ever used, battery performance was outstanding. Iam a mobilephone retailer in trivandrum since last 6 year. So i find each and every handset between 15000 to 20000 and finally i decided purchase this monster. Yes.. my decision was correct.
Fast fingerprint scanner and fast face lock.
Face lock work with any type of light condition.
48 mp cameraveas outstanding picture quality, especially ultra wide angle, live focus, super slow motion, etc.. camera with natural color.
And the device performance, iam a pubg player. I play more than 2 hour per day pubg.. no hanging problem, no heat problem, and its gives smooth playing feel.. and pubg support with Ultra HD graphics mode.

Only the negative point is back poly carbonate body, if samsung made m30s with back glass body it was even more good.

Now my rating 8.5/10

The only thing I disliked is that company should compulsorily provide a back cover as the phone back is fragile and gets scratches easily I have been using this product for 2 months and now I am finding that the mobile is consuming more power and the battery is discharging more quickly in the early days of my purchase the battery used to last for 2 full days and now it is getting discharged fully in 18 to 20 hours

Are you planning on buying this mobile ?

Let's me come with 5 key features which makes a phone perfect
1) display
2)battery
3)design
4)performance
5)camera

Let's come step by step

1)display : the very first this u notice when u open or boot phone is display it's the best display at that price range there may be many amoled displays in other companies but the display this phone offers is the best

2)battery : there is no doubt this phones battery is #monster. If your a medium user u can easily use it for 1 day or more , heavy user who plays games and all u can use it for a day for sure also this phone supports 15w fast charge

3)design :though this phone has 6000mah battery the weight distribution is best it feels less weight in had and in hand feel is good

4)performance : it has exynos9611 processor which read speed and write speed is awsome but coming to GPU compared to other phones at that range this lacks a bit but u can go for this

5) camera : camera in this phone is awsome but this thing is u need to know how to use it and adjust the settings manually

Overall experience at the start it's a good phone at that price and also compared to other companies the service that samsung provides is best
 Will update after 1 month of use

I liked the over all performance of the mobile.
But the phone gets heated if more apps are used at once. Also to mention it gets charged pretty quick... But also gets heated at the time of charging.
I didn't have to charge the phone much often. Because, it didn't require that much charging thanks to its monster capacity battery life.
The phone is bit heavy compared to my previous phone and is wide.
It plays 1080p60 videos on YouTube.
Had a good time Watching movies, series, and playing Pubg.
Also it didn't consume that much of battery while playing games (Pubg).
I would suggest people to buy 128GB, because the picture quality is good, and also shoots good slowmotion videos for which memory would be needed.
Also, finger print sensor and face detection works best in this phone.
It's has sAMOLED display which gives HD display.
Pros:
Good battery life
Camera quality (reare as well as front)
Good gaming experience
Fingerprint reader
Face reader
sAMOLED display
SAR is less than 0.5W/Kg
Good Mobile look
It Has Dolby Atmos so good speaker quality
It Has screen mirroring

Cons:
Gets heated while charging
Gets heated when more apps are open
Heavy in weight

WORST MOBILE EVER BY SAMSUNG .SUCH A COMPANY OF GLOBAL REPUTATION MUST NOT STOOP TO UNWORTHY MARKET TACTICS BY CITING CONFIGURATIONS WHICH ARE ON PAPER ONLY . I HOPE AMAZON INDIA  WILL ALSO INSPECT A  DEVICE LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE BEFORE INVITING CUSTOMERS TO BUY . POOR SAMSUNG POOR AMAZON

Excellent smartphone for the price. Battery life is exceptional, lasting more than 2 days on a single charge, with moderate usage. The display is phenomenal, a dazzling 6.4 inch Amoled screen which is a beauty to behold! The main camera is 48 MP, the pictures are reasonably good. One UI is comfortable to use. The fingerprint reader works smoothly. Overall a great buy for the price. Samsung has done a wonderful job with the Galaxy M30s.

Absolute battery beast of a phone. 2 days of regular use is easily possible with mobile data or wifi turned on throughout. The display is very nice too. I was worried about the plastic back but the build quality feels quite nice and its survived a few drops from pocket height without any damage despite not having a case or screen protector.

The fingerprint reader could be a bit faster but it reads reliably and consistently irrespective of angle or direction.

The camera quality was a little disappointing. Performance is great in some conditions and average in most despite the triple shooter. I was hoping it would grow on me but the width of the camera panel on the back is still a bit of an eyesore.

Otherwise the aesthetics are quite nice and the opal black variant's gradient feels unique and eye catching. I recommend a clear case or cover to show it off.

Overall a solid phone at this price range that I strongly recommend. The battery life is absolutely unbeatable and everything else is generally up to the mark even if it isn't too flashy.

As I went for Samsung brand after a long time ( Xiaomi &amp; Realmi were my favourites during this period due to low cost , high end mobiles), but now this Monster really drew my attention. And I bought it immediately without any delay. First of all, all thanks to samsung for such a decent phone &amp; at such a competitive price range. I bought it for appx 11000/( really very competitive price) during Amazon's big billion days with sbi card with 10% flat discount and cash back of Rs 1000/ as Amazon pay balance.
Talking about its performance, I have faced not even a single issue of lags while using multiple apps. My variant is of 4GB Ram &amp; 64GB of ROM and phone is working like a charm.
  Face unlock feature is very instant but finger print is some slow. Touch is cool and camera quality in natural light is awsome. And and and, finally , the battery. ....really really monster....Katam hi nahi hoti .....And even with such a huge big battery, the overall weight is just 186 gms.....impressive .
  One thing which is disappointing..is , the plastic body...the polycarbonate one, which is , quality wise very good , but look &amp; feel wise..just ok.
  Finally guys, this time samsung really gave a big big fight to its chinese rivals &amp; hope it will win the race.

Got this one at 11,099 with exchange which makes it a steal deal for me
Got it delivered within 2 days of ordering
.
The screen looks GREAT! Samsung has the best displays in the industry, and this one is no exception.
.
The camera quality is also very good as compared to the competition and the wide angle camera is sweet.
.
An A++ for battery life plus the fast charge bundled in the box, also the device is very light
.
The performance is great to
.
But one setback is the design, the plastic back spoils the feel a bit, as compared to the reamle 5/pro as well as the redmi note 8 launched today.
.
If design is not ur priority then,
A perfect device at this price, Go for it🔥

Mb Elegant looks captivate your attention instantly. Loved this green n blue mixed color variant. Handles multi apps smoothly. Camera quality superb. Finger print scanner works well. Satisfied. The Big Surprise is "Gaint 🔋 Battery". Damsure 24hrs backup at hardcore Heavy use. For me it's going well for 3.5days at single charge. Due to Heavy Battery capacity, Mobile weighs bit weight. But it's negligible thing. One who looks for stunning looks n battery wise n storage n camera can go with this beautiful ❤️ Samasung M30s Mb.

1.Fingerprint reader- Its quick
2.Camera Quality - Picture quality is awesome. Its 48 mega pixel camera enables you to capture images as you see it. Night mode allows you to capture photos serenly in light conditions.
3.Battery Life- The most important which i liked about this phone is its battery life. My battery lasts for 2 days till i charge. I can enjoy travelling and capture moments without worrying about its battery drainage. This feature makes this phone distinct from any of its competitors phone in the same range criteria.
Samsung allows offers its customers a unique feauture in each and every model developed by them. Samsung M30S also has some unique features which makes him the best phone among its other competitors selling products in the same range.

This phone is one of the best phone under 20000 price cap. I'm a frequent buyer of phones and this phone has surprised me with it's great battery life and a good night camera mode. It has a 6000mah battery which provides for upto 36 hours on normal daily usage and 12 to 14 hours for heavy gaming and online streaming. The main camera is triple camera of 48 mp(48+8+5) which is a great camera compared to MI phone and POCO phones under same range. The front camera is 16 mp which is average one. That is added with 6GB of RAM and 128 gb of internal storage for Rs.16999 and 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage for Rs.13999 which are similar to the new phones available. The screen is 16.21cm notch display with samoled and 1080×2340 pixels which provides a good view. The phone has Exynos 9611 octa-core processor which provides great experience. In all the phone is great and you can buy if you want a gaming phone with decent camera.

Budget friendly smart phone. Everything feels good about the phone but screen freezes for a micro second oftenly when you change between apps which is embarrassing considering its RAM size.  Display looks good, but you have to be highly careful with it because display shattered just after one week, though I have a tempered t on it. When I called Samsung care, they quoted 3500 and service charges additional for display replacement. So if you're a tuff user, don't go for it.

I have been using this from last 10 days .
My opinion is  Samsung has its brand value in market and service is best when you campare to other campanies.This phone is best for user who do lots of multitasking ,PUBG run without lag, battery life is superb.
It almost last for 1.5 days with average usage and 2 days with less usage.
UI of samsung is very user friendly.
Camera is superb. I love the slow motion feature and super slow motion feature. Some feature requires lights such as live focus. some photos I clicked of Ravan and some fireworks camera performed excetionally well. This phone is Awesome in this range price

I purchased 6gb/128gb model of this series.
Cons:-
1. Fingerprint reader placement is not correct its quite difficult for unlocking it for me.
2. Fingerprint reader speed is not satisfying forgot about one plus and all even you can compare it moto g5s plus.
3. Camera quality is not matched to Samsung standards specially front camera. It's giving a image like we edited it instead of more like realistic one.

Pros:-
1. Battery life is very good which I think is quite a important factor to consider this device.
2. Even it has large battery size still it doesn't take much time for getting fully charged with the charger which comes with device.
3. Perfomance is good  up till now.

Although with good performance and excellent battery life this is best bid for gamers but it is not suitable for hardcore gamers even it get heat up if you play pubg for 5-10 mins in Ultra HD mode.

Writing the review after 10 days of usage
I ordered this product on 22/9/19 and got it on 23/9/19
Thanks to Amazon for fast delivery
The package was delivered in good condition

Now product review
Pro's
- 6000 mAh battery is working as specified (2 days with single charge)
- triple camera setup
- camera in daylight
- 6gb ram 128gb inetrnal storage variant
- AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution
- even though it's having a polycarbonate back it looks good
Con's
- camera resolution is mentioned as 48mp but if you zoom in the photo it looks like oil painting but that's ok for me as I am not concerned about it that much (so if you want a mobile with great camera features then you can buy some other one)
- as I said earlier the mobile looks good as far as it's design is concerned but it's polycarbonate back is fingerprint lover so definitely you need to buy back cover
- Samsung is not providing headphones with this mobile
- available only at online shopping (amazon.in, Samsung.com) not even available at offline Samsung stores

Over performance is awesome, with few cons

Camera clarity is not so good, pics in low light are so dull.

Coming to game booster, when i turned on thegame booster and played pubbg, mobile is not taking more than two touches. I turned of the game booster it worked better with 3 to four touches.... Should be fixed in the update.

Next about the carier signal and hotspot i faced little problem like showing signal strength low( i have a doubt that is the displaying is poor or really not taking full signal). When i used the hotspot and connected to lap it is little slow.
Where i found good speed with same sim and placement with other mobiles.
This is the problem i faced .. but the diagnosis results were perfect. And shown no issues.
There is no issue..

And finally build quality is good but better...

Coming to screen, finger print, face detection- very smooth and accurate. Feels soo good..
The face is some time unlocking with closed eyes, can be corrected in updates, not prb...

But theawsome feature i liked in the mobile i-
Multi window feature on the screen. With split screen. Itcan do 5 tasks at a time excluding split screen, that is total of 7 tasks.

I've used this phone for almost 14 days and here's what I cat tell:
Pros:
1) Great battery life; definitely a winner with the fast charging.

2) Amazing UI; Samsung's OneUI IS a showstopper, offering great features without compromising either the battery life or the processing speed. Always On Display is love.

3) Display; This. Display. Is. Great. Period.

4) Weight; The phone is surprisingly light considering that it comes with 6000mAh of juice.

Cons:
1) Build quality: )Build quality is downright poor.

2) Performance: Not for playing high end, ultra graphic quality games.

3) Camera: 48MP camera sounds great, right? You might be a little disappointed as the shots are noisy, while the ultra wide shots are downright blurry round the corners. Hope Samsung fixes this with an update.

Fingerprint sensor: The fingerprint sensor is pathetic.

Verdict: The Samsung Galaxy M30S is a monster of a phone in this budget range, with the added benefit of being from one of the world's most trusted brands. Definitely a must for a SUPERB MULTIMEDIA EXPERIENCE. The display certainly blows the competition out of the water!!

In my life I've not seen a worst phone like Samsung m30s, camera quality so bad just like key pad mobile, so don't buy it, it's better to donate in poor people. before you should know :  1 ) after purchase Amazon will not refund money on exchange  2) Amazon will not provide you a exchange this phone with another brand mobile  3) Amazon will try their best so that you cannot exchange your product with a new one, indirectly they try their best to assume that you are a liar , and they are the God

Phone is like Jabardast.....Awesome...Super Amoled Screen give feel like Valvet Touch..
Camera, Processor,  Screen, Speed all again Jabardast.....Awesome...

It was very hard to switch from Mi after using from last 4years and was in delimea whether I should continue with Mi or change to some other brand. After lots deliberation, comparision and discussion. Finally took decision to change the brand.
Now I pet on my back that I decision was good because Samsung not let me down.

It's the samsung's best smartphone as far as the budget is concerned and one of best smartphones available in the market right now I am saying this on the basis it's performance becoz of it's latest exynos 9611 processor and 6000 mah battery which you can use all day long with heavy usage and 2 and a half days on normal usage and 10 to 12 hours of play pubg straight. And becoz of it's SAmoled display with 1080P resolution and battery optimisation update you get more battery life and colour contrast . EVEN THEN (after 6000 mah battery) it's very very slim.it's camera quality is also decent although it's not as good as realme 5 pro becoz of samsung camera sensor instead of sony but it's fine.
One another cons is it's fingerprint sensor which is little bit slower than other phones
But it's face recognition is very quick so you don't have to depend on fingerprint sensor.
Display- 5 stars
Face recongnition- 4.5 stars
Battery-5
Shape and design-4.5
Processor and performance- 4.5
Fingerprint sensor- 3stars
Camera- 4stars

The battery life is amazing as of now. It does get heated up pretty quick even while charging but fast charge can be disabled to prevent heat up issues. The camera quality is great, video quality is also amazing but it looks pixelated in low light areas. Handles high spec requiring games smoothly. Couldnt ask for a better phone at this price range. Surprisingly lightweight considering the 6000mAh battery. Audio is good and the phone itself looks great. Definitely recommended

Best Samsung phone in this segment

Pros:
1) Super Amoled Dsiplay
2) Latest Strong GPU, support games in HDR mode
3) Display looks awesome with notch
4) Always On Display
5) Video Recording is clear and decent.

Cons:
1) Charger provide by company is very short cable.
2) Battery capacity is overstated. It's closer to 3000mAh rather than 6000mAh.
3) Phone OS uses almost 2.6 gb of RAM and phone hangs even to play simple games like fun kid cars.
4) No display protection, No gorilla glass. Need to be added gorilla glass.
5) Photos captured using 48 MP camera are stretched when zoom the photos.

A good product from samsung with Super AMOLED display.

The 6000mAH battery is really awesome and can run for two days on a single charge.

The grip of the phone is nice, it is not slippery, it has a good grip in the hand and can be used without any case cover protection if used carefully.

The 48 mp camera is nice, which takes good images in low light.
The 8mp wide angle camera is also good for taking landscape images on day light.
The 5 mp live camers gives a good bokhe effect for the image.

The 4gb RAM, 64gb storage varient is good to store lots of data with a dedicates SD card slot. The phone Runs smooth with multiple application open at a time. There is no laging n hanging issue with this phone.

Over all Samsung M30s is the best budget phone in the market which i got it for 11600 in this amazon great Indian Festival after a huge discounts from SBI and amazon cashback.

Delivery by Amazon is grate, got it the very next day afternoon.

Thanks for Samsung and Amazon for launching the best budget phone with many features.

The super AMOLED display, the 6000 mAH battery and the 48mp cam in this price range is really a fantastic deal.

As the description suggests, the phone has an amazing battery life. I binge watch series, play games, surf on social media and the phone goes on without charging for almost 3 days. I can go on long trips without bothering to take the power bank.
I am yet to purchase a cover and glass, however I did drop the phone down and it survived!! No broken peices or scratches on the screen. So fair to say it survived the drop test.
The screen clarity is great. This can be seen especially when you play games on this phone.
I took some time getting used to the UI of this phone as the phone I previously had was not this updated. However within two days I was able to navigate easily.
The camera of this phone is good, however not the best I've seen. It taken good photos if the subject is near, however if the subject is far, the photos come out a little blurry.
In conclusion I would say this phone is worth every penny spent on it.
I bought this phone during the Amazon great Indian festival and thus got a good discount too.

Overall  the phone  is quite  good. Some of the points to be noted are:
1. Best  Display in this segment.
2.Acceptable Performance overall there are noticeable  lags in daily use
3. Camera Performance  is best with good lighting  conditions  but gets worse with  low light conditions
4. Battery.  I sincerely  doubt the battery  is 6000 Mah since the battery drains  fast as in a 4500 Mah,maybe a software  update can fix it..
5.Cellular Reception: The cellular  reception is not good as in the case of other redmi phones. Lack of Carrier Aggregation greatly  limits the 4g speeds altough  the processor is capable.of achieving  3ca speeds  ,I hope Samsung  will provide Carrier  Aggregation  with future  updates.

The phone is very good for Media consumption and daily  purposes  due to its amoled display  which is the best  in segment. For gaming there are better options are there .

Performance
After 10 days of usage it's perform all day today activities very smooth I'm not a gammer i cant say anything about that but this phone do all activities really smooth and especially it's display is really awesome. If you are normal user no second thought just go fo it.

I have purchased M30s on November 19, 2019.  Since I have purchased this product, I am facing problem of network.
I have to come out of my house to take a call.  I complaint regarding this to Samsung and their expertise on 18.02.2020.  with reference No.2267824599.  The expertise have advised me to re-set the system accordingly.  I reset the system with the help of expertise but the problem remained the same so far.

This problem came to know me when I purchased Oppo A5S phone for my wife.  It shows all the network full inside the house and network is working properly and also youtube is always ready, when it is on.

While my Samsung M30s does not do the same. That means there is some problem in my phone which I came to know after purchase of Oppo  A5S.

6000 mAh is the Highlight of the Phone in view of the Battery Life issues on Samsung Phones.  This is Well Addressed.

Finger Print Reader is at the Back and not the On Screen Finger Print -  One thing you have to Compromise.

Camera Quality is the major Market Puller just as with many other brands.

Very very poor quality of the product. the phone is not even capable to handle pop up window of permission. The phone is lagging too much and needs to restart every time and for every application. my second sim is not working in this phone. Very very bad quality phone. Similar to the dummy phone only. Not preferable to buy the phone. if you have extra money and you want to donate to Samsung then you can definitely go for this phone.

Hello All, I am writing this review after 7 days of using Samsung Galaxy M30s 6+128 GB. I gifted this to my sister and she loved it!

1. sAMOLED screen - Perfect and class!
2. 6000 MAH Battery! Yes, it lasts around 2 days of normal usage!
3. Samsung Brand.. Thank you Samsung for giving this for 17k and Amazon for 15,299 INR after discount during Sale!
4. Camera 48MP it's good and you need to select different modes as per your requirement. I have posted few pics and they are really good. (Aapko camera, battery, display achha chahiye and price bhi kam chahiye! Aisa kaisa chalega bhaiyya n didi? 😛)
5. Video quality is superb! Colors are reflected good when using normal video mode, though for slowmo mode, colors are not that real. Selfie gives soft images but they are good when compared to other brands realme XT, moto!
6. Sound and call quality is good enough at this price
7. Being an Artist, I loved the videos captured through this phone and will be using it more during my live Sand Art shows! (Search Google, FB, Insta : Prasad Sand Art)

Thanks for going through this review and hope you will like the phone as well!

This has been a great purchase. This time Samsung has tried to tick every boxes when it comes value for money. The display is gorgeous SuperAMOLED. The back feels little whacky wrt design choice. The processor combined with the OneUI carries every task with breeze. The camera takes good quality pictures. In all the phone meets the expectations from the money that we input in it. Should definitely be considered.

I had a little bit doubt about this monster title when they launched this handset but seriously bro really they nailed it  I'm 100% satisfied with this monster device. The real attraction of this device is battery seriously it's a real monster.  I'm not a heavy user sometimes I get 2 days battery life for a average user definitely get 24 hours and loved it because of that. And camera performance is also very well 48mp have live focus and extreme details wide angle shots are super crazy no shaking while shooting videos around 95% is what I felt ,fingerprint sensor is also fast  display performance is damn good night day always super clear , Always On Display is nice it's not heating while gaming for a price below 15000 u have a Samsung device with all of this stuff ,go for it.

Fingerprint sensor is little slow, camera is very good , earlier in some reviews I read found people complaining about camera but so for I have no complaints , battery is awesome even my friends who has big brand phones gets jealous for battery life. Sound quality for regular use is good. I'm not a gamer so 4 + 64 works for me easily . This is the first time I bought phone of Samsung and I'm happy using it. Even the looks and everything is catchy. Last but not the least the price is real catch

Hated budget samsung phones for a long time because of performance issues.
Perfect for people like me who watch a lot of content + game anything at high settings without thinking of charging for atleast 4 hrs . Camera's are really good compared to other same priced smartphones. And although it comes with a headphone jack at home you won't need them because speakers are really loud and are clear too.
Face unlock is fast but sometimes doesn't works in lowlight . Fingerprint reader is too small for big finger people like me so have to press finger twice a lot of time but response time is good.
Overall a great budget smartphone  from Samsung after a long time.

On Second day, I charged it 100% at 7am. After whole day of usage, at 9pm, the remaining was around 29%. Screen on time 6 hours, clicked at least 50photos, 150 times unlock with fingerprint scanner - only 2-3 tike it was failed,played songs, used whatsapp and Facebook.

Pros:
1. Screen quality is outstanding.
2. Very good battery.
3. Camera is pretty good in outdoor lighting condition, wide angel lens works very good, selfie camera is also very good in outdoor, live focus mode works fine.
4. RAM management is done well.
5. No lag till now with multiple app usage. Procssor works flawlessly.
6.Build quality is very good, although back is not metal, feels premium.
7. In spite of having such a massive battery, weight balance is done very good, doesn't feel heavy.

Cons:
1. Speaker quality is not that great.
2. No back cover is provides in box, although the back is a fingerprint magnet.
3. Camera quality can be improved with software update.

For whom loudspeaker and camera is not highest priority, can buy without confusion. Also hope camera will be improved with update.

First and foremost, the device is stunning and the cameras are too good, brilliant and crystal clear images. The thing which impressed me a lot is battery life... It spend easily more than 2 days after full charge.
Further,  in my experience with this product I didn't find any negative point for the device.
+ves are,
1. Excellent Camera with 5 stars
2. Outstanding battery life...
3. Beyond thinking Gaming Experience like PUBG.
4. Which is special because of Amazon, is delivery services.. That was very good.. Nd i got my device one day before the promised date..
Satisfying Services by Amazon and Excellent and first Experience with Samsung as I didn't have any Samsung device before this is my first one and honestly speaking... I recommend this to every smartphone lover because this phone  is smart in reality. I can say that now I don't need to switch to any other Manufacturer Company as The Samsung is the best and out of the World Company providing best services to customers...
Good Luck guys...
Shop Good...

It's been 3days since i uave recieved the product.
The first time i saw its screen on ..i was BLOWN by the punchy colors and vibrance of the sAMOLED Screen. this is the best screen a smartphone can get at a price less than 25k?
Let's move to camera dept..in my short in house usage i am unable to judge the camera well but will truly appreciate how it performs in low light and dim light. In my short use i would say SAMSUNGS 48MP camera mode is better than XIOMI Redmi note 7 pro 48MP mode .
Samsung obviously offers deeper optimisations than Xiaomi.
Next performance u wont feel a lag it's buttery smooth .
THE ONE UI,samungs new user interface is feature packed ..it's so good u cant keep ur eyes if it

CONS
video shooting is not so good in low light/dim light
The super slow Mo is overhyped ..it can only shoot  A 1sec video

I love this one very much. I like Samsung products more than other brands. I upgraded Samsung J6 to the new Samsung M30s. According to me it is one of the best. Phone is amazing. Display is excellent. Fingerprint reader works fine and fast. Rear camera is perfect. But in case of front camera a little disappointment, there is no sharpness in images and lot of beautification. I don't use front camera too much, so that problem doesn't affect me. Battery backup is amazing.
I recommend M30s. It is one of the best from Samsung at this price range. Go for it #GoMonster.

If there is something good then something bad too in everything. In this phone everything is good but the only thing not that good Is the weight of the phone.its slightly heavy than MI or other phones.

1) The camera quality is decent at the price range,no over exposure or tonal contrast.
2)The phone doesn't lag,I have been playing Pubg 10hrs a day in HDR-high settings and the phone doesn't lag. Also call of duty runs smoothly.
3) The battery life is insane, I can literally go for around a day from morning to evening playing,surfing and listening music with bluetooth earphones connected all the time. Still left with around 25-30% battery at the end of the day.
4) No heating issue so far.
5) At this price range,only thing I find not satisfactory is the fingerprint sensor,doesn't always respond to touch. Face recognition is good though.
Over all,in a budget phone category,it is worth the money.

Awesome phone by Samsung at this price point. Feel like a premium device.

Ticked all relevant boxes:-
-Super amoled panel (no other chinese company can meet the benchmark of Samsung)
-Monster Battery - It lasted for 1.5 -2 Days easily with Moderate usage
- Good Camera, few tweaks still required by Samsung in App, that can be made easily by OTA update
- One UI, stable and beautiful, far better than Oxygen, Color OS and MIUI
- Processor (exy 9611) - No lag noticed, great RAM Management, I hardly play games so smooth experience till now
- Brand Value

I was a Samsung Fan earlier, but due to pricing and get value moved to other brands. But, current price proposition made me again to Buy Samsung and now I feel I should again stick to Samsung.

Pro Tip: Keep Night mode ON to get better battery life

1. NETWORK RECEPTION ISSUE - Samsung M30S has very serious network problem. It has very poor network strength which results into slow internet and call drops. I am facing this issue since the beginning. I have checked all possibilities like SIM card change, APN reset, reset network settings, factory data reset, etc. but none of them are working. I have contacted Amazon for this issue and they advised me to perform Blancco test (this is a test which performed by Amazon in order to diagnose the issue - according to amazon). Let me highlight one thing, this test only checked if the services on device are active or not. This app does not check the services deeply which results into all test pass. AMD on Google Play store this app has a rating of 1.4 stars. How can amazon uses this poor app to check device?
2. Camera Quality - They say it's 48 MP camera but its wrong. Camera is of 16 MP.

I request every Indian that PLEASE do not buy this phone especially from Amazon as you will get worst customer service from them and also phone has serious hardware problem.

P.S. - Above reviews are my own.

Awesome product, samoled display is gorgeous, battery lasts about 22hrs for normal usage under one charge, fingerprint reader is fast and accurate, rear 48mp camera takes nice photos but sometimes colour reproduction looks artificial and boosted, front camera average, fast charger bundled with the product is not so fast, speed and memory management is very good, only cons I found missing on screen fingerprint reader
Overall I would rate it 4.5 out of 5 stars and I got this with an sbi card discount of 10% and acko free screen replacement offer. Thanks for reading

Hello guys,

I bought SAMSUNG M30s in the great Indian sale on 29th Oct. The delivery from Amazon was quick -I received my phone on the next evening.

To be Frank I had decided to purchase RealMe 5 Pro and was waiting for the sale to go live. As I was about to order, my friend asked me to check out M30s. To my surprise M30s was a complete package with a SAMSUNG brand.  And I went ahead and order it right away.

I am writing this feedback after 7 days (I have done Durga puja trip with this phone)

All positives from the phone so far.
1) Great camera
2) Great display (though I was not fan of this but it does give a feel of One plus at such budget)
3) Good processing so far (received 2-3) updates
4) Audio is also good

On the not great experience so far
1) Charging takes asome time (though it's a huge battery)
2) 2) Also not sure about the 6000mah battery because it didn't come to me like one

Apart from this there are differences in usage from my previous mobile phones and hence commenting on them would be early and naive  of me!

I booked this phone on 4th October and got it on the next day ie on the 5th of October 2019 itself. So thanks to Amazon for quicker delivery. After three days of use, I am writing my experience, as under:

1. Look - Very good &amp; classy.
2. Display - Very good.
3. Battery -  Very good. After it is charged 100% and is used surfing internet, lasts for one day comfortably.
4. Camera - Primary camera is fantastic. Front camera exaggerates the look a bit and makes one's face unrealistically beautiful, though I love it.
5. Finger print sensor.  Very Good.
6. Face recognition.  Very Good.
7. Charging. Very good.
8. Heating of phone. After half an hour continuous net surfing, it gets heated, which makes me uncomfortable. I have been using Redmi 3S prime for the last three years, but never came across such a problem.

The Samsung Galaxy M30s has a good display, and watching content on it is a pleasant experience.One of the main talking feature of the Samsung Galaxy M30s is its cameras and the picture clearity. I did not have to charge the device before at least two days with heavy usage. The biometric unlock on the M30s is plenty fast and the sensor is positioned well, and the finger rests on the scanner easily and unlocks the phone quickly. The face unlock support is not as  fastest as it could be. The face unlock also struggles to unlock the phone in challenging lighting situations.Overall i have great experience with Samsung galaxy M30s.

Thanks to Samsung for giving such an amazing product in cheaper than expected price range.
Am not a photographer, and never tried to be perfect n clicking pics. Still you can see those pics I posted it got appreciated by many of my friends.
I couldn't afford to get DSLR.
But with this less cost I feel M30s s DSLR with great camera features having 48Mp ,8mp ,5mp and 16mp in front.
Also though Samsung 1st time user I feel touch screen s very soft like feather.
Pros:
1. Camera and its wider angle
2. SAmoled touch s very soft and nice
3. Stylish mobile with dual color at back door
4. 92% covers screen s good on viewing movie
5. Less weight
6. Smart touch s best on swapping between phones
7. Many features present  inside M30s are even compared to higher mobiles
8. Battery is awesome that it stays 3 complete days even after rough continuity usages
9. Charge a getting full faster
10. Dolby atmos effect on headphone are really the best I admired

Cons: fingerprint is at back door instead in front screen.

Otherwise I like this mobile at its fullest and coolest mobile ever handled.

Pros:
1. Battery life (6000mAh) pretty much keeps the phone alive for almost 2 days (normal use : net,calls,browsing,etc)

2. Camera (48+8+5 rear...16 front) is so good that even iPhone users ask you to click their photos! The picture quality is great of the rear camera. Even the night mode captures cool night shots! Rear camera can record slo-mo, hyper lapse, 4k videos, etc.

3. Design, touch, UI, Look &amp; Feel is awesome. Much respect for Samsung!

4. Performance is smooth and competent to play games such as pubg, call of duty,etc even  in HDR. Overall flow is smooth

5. Type C-port along with a 15W charger for fast charging. Battery went from 10 to 100% in just 1.5hrs..3.5mm headphone jack provided.

Cons :
1. A little bit heavy and seems like it has a plastic body.

2. Phone heats up a little while playing games ( I guess that's normal ).

3. Front camera is overrated.

4. No gorilla glass

I have two serious concerns:
1. My Samsung M30S mobile (which is supposed to have come up with fast
charging) takes about 5-6 hours for a complete charging which is just
absurd. Tried it many times. In fact, I feel that the total duration of
charge time is increasing day by day. Really did not expect this from
SAMSUNG product.
2. I know my usage very well. I strongly believes that the mobile is
getting discharged very quickly having said its MONSTROUS battery power
of 6000mah. Earlier I was using a MI phone having only 4100 mah and it
was not getting discharged as quickly as M30s . In fact, the the length
of time from a 100% battery to 1% should have increased as compared to
my MI phone. In reality it has decreased.

The main highlights of this phone is
1.Battery( though it is 6k mah its feel like 4k or 5k mah battery).
2.display is superb you can not compare smsung display with Xiaomi device. 100% satisfied with display.
3.samsung one Ui is like better smooth performance.
What i dint like
1.Fingerprint sensor is little bit slow as compared to xiaomi fingerprint sensor.
2.speaker is little bit(notice if you hear with consciously) low volume compare to xiaomi)
3. Front camera is 16mp is capable to catch good selfi but Samsung image processing creates photo with extra smooth skin which look bad.

Fingerprint reader : It detects the fingerprint with the lightning speed. The fingerprint sensor on the back is super fast and accurate as well. The feather touch fingerprint sensor unlocks the phone in a go.

Camera quality : The camera captures shots with ease, with a dedicated night mode option we get great photos in low light as well. 8mp ultra wide camera extend picture quality further by making them more vivid. The live focus option for portraits advances the bokeh effect on the phone. It does not disappoint on the front camera either. In addition to 4k video recording option the phone also gives super slow motion, super steady mode and hyperlapse option.

Battery life :  The Samsung Galaxy M30s with it's 6000 mAh monster battery gives us a long gaming session without worrying for charging. With the heavy usage played games and streamed episodes the battery lasted more than a full day. The phone also supports fast charging and the 15w charger is like a cherry on a cake.

I bought this mobile for my dad and he's happy with the phone performance especially the battery backup and Camera quality. Somehow not impressed with the build quality the phone has, compared to the other phones in this range it has a below average build quality, and the finger print part is not well maintained. Phone's Super AMOLED screen is awesome, super bright and a very good treat for your eyes. I would rate this as 4, as it is a good phone in the mid range, those who are not really a fan of gamers but looking for a good battery life, Screen, Camera and brand.

Superb phone around 14k but still battery  needs some improvement it struggles in giving that much huge battery life but it is ok and also front camera needs huge improvement, those pictures  looks very soft and Iam very much disappointed with front cam. But it is best in it's SUPER AMOLED display and Dolby atmos and 48mp cam and monster 6000mah battery. I suggest those who don't  afford money on phones regularly  and those who wants to use phones for maximum of 3 years you can blindly go for it. Gaming performance is awesome, no lags but minor frame drops in pubg.  Exgynos 9611 is a good processer at that price point. You can go for it

This phone is a winner for Samsung out of the box. It is a perfect all rounder. Great screen, fabulous camera and the big battery life of two days makes this phone a must have. The weight of the phone is just 188 grams due to the use of plastic. This is a huge achievement despite the huge battery.
The user interface is fluid at all times. Extra features compensate for absence of stock android. The performance of the phone is good enough for all users. The phone is also a looker and the opal blue colour is the best to own.

The phone is pretty slim,with a nice look. The battery life is good. Camera quality is superb at this budget. It has other feature like Dolby Atmos that makes your songs awesome.
The back cover is basically a plastic cover not a glass coated cover, thats the only thing I did not like. Rest phone is 4.5/5

Been using this phone for the past week. Day after day I have been making this phone toil.

The amazing 6000mAh battery has proven it's worth. It runs for about 2 days continuously even after listening to music, 2 movies and continuous usage of internet.

The fact that my friends are amazed at the pics I sent them alone justify the camera quality, both rear and front.

I would definitely recommend this phone.

Will come back with more points after proper usage.

Thank you Samsung, for this great phone in a budget price!

DOESNT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL SIM CARDS.
After using for two and half days. I've the honest review.
Comparing to my 3 years old Moto G4 plus which i bought for almost same cost.
Camera: WORST especially selfie.
  Rear camera is not worth 48 MP but just 12MP.(Moto G4 plus has far better camera). FOCUSING IS VERY POOR TOO.
FAST CHARGING TAKES 2.5HRS TO CHARGE BATTERY.(MOTO G4 Plus charges to 40% in 15 min) M30s charges only 10% in 20 min
Power and Volume button make lot of sound.
Display i would rate 4.5/5
BATTERY IS AWESOME.
OVERALL PHONE QUALITY IS BELOW THE STANDARDS. I WOULD NOT CALL IT A MONSTER BUT JUST A GOOD BATTERY PHONE.

People advised me not to buy a Samsung phone because of the lagging and battery issues in the previous models,but this phone definitely proves them wrong. The quality of the rear camera and it's feature you get is the best you can get within this price range,but the front camera definitely needs some improvement. The battery is the highlight among it's many highlights,it has been three days and I had fully charged my phone only once and before that whatever charge was there was done by the manufacturer and now even there is 50% charge left. Screen quality is pretty good as well and the weight distribution  of this phone is better than the most. At the end, Samsung has given few attractive features in this phone like Always on display, night mode and game booster.
I haven't yet played any heavy games on this phone but till now everything is smooth af.

After using for almost half a month reviewng this...Phone is awesome . Battery is too good. And even with such big battery phone weight to much less. I think this is best phone in this price segment with Samsung's super amoled screen. Only cons is Camera qualitiy not that good... I think it will be fixed  in next update.
U can stream netflix n prime in full hd ...wow. Played games like pubg n cod...working fine with high graphics . And one best thing of samsung is its UI ...I love it a lot!  Fingerprint reader is also fast . Till now no issues with this phone.

Over all a good phone. Battery capacity is no good saying it is 6000 mah.my old mi a1 was having 3890 mah battery but it runs almost for same duration as m30s.
Pros- apps can be hidden.
  camera is ok.display is ok.
  always om display is marvalous.
  screen works as front flash is a wonderful thing.
  Wifi calling is good feature.
  Many  other important features are available.
Cons-battery capacity .although it is 6000mah it is as good as
  4000 mah.

I have loved this phone in every way. The fingerprint sensor is quite quick. Camera quality is excellent even getting better with the updates. The effect that this phone applies automatically is absolutely fantastic. Battery life is excellent i was on a trip for some days where i couldn't get to charge it but it still worked for 1½day (still 20-30%) was available even took photos and for some duration by internet was still ON. The quality of display provided by Samsung is absolutely fantastic (no company can touch the display quality as of samsung).
Overall i am very happy with the phone . Processor provides a great backup for playing large games and opening multiple applications.

Thank u samsung for providing such quality phone and at such low price.

48mp triple rear camera is a big LOL. The focusing is pathetic and so is the tap to focus option, it hardly focuses. The pro mode has no option to set the shutter speed nor can you set it using any third party apps. Pro mode is just for namesake. Low light photos suck as well. The night mode basically bumps up the ISO and night looks more like evening. The fingerprint scanner is slow infact very slow compared to other brands including the older Redmi's. The only thing which is good and works as promised is the battery. Easily works for a day and half with normal to heavy usage. Games like PubG work but with a few lags. On the scale of 1-5 I'll give it a 2. Not recommended if you're looking for a better camera performance. Samsung India please improve the camera in upcoming software updates if you can.

Like : price point with latest camera sensors and crisp display well balanced heavy duty battery.
Security : faster finger print and face unlock.
Performance : good processor for daily use .can handle daily use apps normally without slowing down.
Display: as always samoled is best and crisp.
Battery and cellular connectivity: good and clear.
What's can be improved: camera is ok but not the beast but with that price point it's ok.
Body is polycarbon which attaracts scraches easily.
Summary : considering price point it's good bet from Samsung in mid range segment. Trustworthy and reliable.

Battery life : excellent 6000 mah and fast charging is just awesome coupled with usb type-C
Fingerprint: good but could have been better if they added in-display fingerprint sensor
Camera : good optimization and the dynamic range of camera is superb at this price point , however , there is some lens distortion at corners while taking a ultra wide shot in low light condition but it can be overlooked.
The camera stabilization is very good although its does not work in the 4k mode.
Processor is very good and you can play pubg in hdr at considerable fps without any screen drop.
Look : i have the sapphire blue colour and it looks good . It has a plastic back but the glossy back surface wouldn't be dissapointing.
After sales service : C'mon we are talking about samsung phones so you can be assured of best-in-class after sales service although you will not need it.

Finger print note work so fast sometimes it can't ditect my fingerprind,
Camera was good i mean it is superb its all camera modes are work well
In day light it clicks awsome photos with fine clearity &amp; and night mode in this camera setting also work well
Battry life was good enough i mean i thaught it will be last long for two days aur at least one a half day but it will last for one day only i mean i am a rough user i used phone daily 15hr at least , and charging was bit slow .
But all these are managable i thing the only drawback of this phone will be its feature's it have less features and small deltailing in phones are missing other wise it will worth
I am happy to have it.an the last thing its look was amazing i get so many compliments

I am one of those people who purchased this phone very curiously on the first hour of its launch. I felt some features are amazing in this phone and some could be more amazing indeed.

At positive side:
1. It looks so beautiful with its elegant S.O. LED Display.
2. Battery life is too good that it took 40 minutes to come down to 99% from 100/% at the first day and it's quite good till now.
3. Fast Charging feature can make you really astonished, it's that much quick.
4. Camera quality is good but not the best.
5. Operating system is very quick and never hangs.
6. Slim and reasonable weight to hold.
7. Perfect Screen Size to use.

At Negative Side:
1. The phone is very slippery in nature due to its very smooth finish. You cannot use it freely without a back cover, unless scratches are instant.
2. Even though the display looks very good, it is very delicate that it's the display glass, not the thick screen guard, who breaks the first. I promise on this. An ordinary phone display can be more strong than this display, leave about Gorilla Glass. The cost of the new glass is around 4500 rupees, officially.
3. Fingerprint sensor is very poor compared to the very ordinary Xiomi MI phones. Many times it can not capture your finger properly even for a little wet or dust, which very good on MI phones.
4. Camera quality is not so good compared to the previous phones of Samsung itself. The flash light is very poor in this price range.
5. Some apps you cannot uninstall even though you don't like them.
6. You cannot place your phone on any hard surface as the camera is literally touching the surface and prone to scratches.
7. Blunder is, there is no Notification light. I don't know why Samsung failed to understand the importance of that Notification light, when other companies are coming up with different colours of light for different apps.

Overall this is a good phone but can be improved to be the best.

I bought  this phone because  of it's  battery  life , but display and performance  of the phone is also very good with 4gb ram. Little  disappointed  with built quality. Cheap plastic used fit and finishs are fine. Upper body vibrates while using primary speaker at full volume because  of plastic  body.
 Display  may broke if mobile  falls from hand in normal  conditions because of battery size and its weight. I would  suggest  to buy hard case for better safety instead  of flexible  silicone  cases. At this price its good deal.

I bought this mobile on the very first sale as a Amazon Prime member. I am glad to tell you to that I am overall satisfied with this mobile. The overall features of this phone is very good and till now the performance has been excellent. The display quality is also very good. The most important thing which I would like to tell you is that the SAR value of this phone which is safe for us and it is a very important factor for me. Radiations are no joke and health is important.
The SAR valve is 0.468 W/KG which is safe according to the info given by the company.

Pros-

- 48 MP Camera
- Good Front Camera 16 MP.  I personally liked it very much.
- Supports 4k video recording, 30 fps UHD
- 6000 mah Battery
- FHD+ sAmoled Infinity U Display, display is very good.
- Exynos 9611 processor
- 15W Fast Charging

I am writing this review after 5 days of usage , in my opinion this is the best phone in this price range I compared with my friend's redmi note 7 pro the camera is far more better than that.
The negative are less and those are: it is not gorilla glass so may break easily , I felt finger print sensor slow , speaker is not loud as other phones
Positive: this display is richest in this range the best u can get , as u know the battery is best it fomes for one and half days , camera is really awesome I enjoyed it taking many photos and cherry on the top it runs in ONEUI the best UI in present date it looks good, fast and snappy . Soon u will get android 10 update so after That u will get security updates easy and fast every month so security will be topnotch
I got this for 15300 by using SBI card in great Indian festival

Samsung M30s is the all rounder in the class of mobiles under15k price budget. As mentioned it has got great rear camera with many options such as focus mode,pro mode,food photography, night mode and so on, with a great video recording quality and duration which also comes with three special modes namely slow motion, ultra slowmo.. and hyperlapse(fast recording).
The interface is smooth and user friendly, and mostly the games run smooth( PUBG being played at highest graphic setting). The battery is the most highlighted feature as it has a jaw dropping capacity of 6000mah which lasts long( for me it lasted not much long as I use bluetooth,wifi,location all the time) with a fast charge technology.
The security is the  uncrackable feature of the phone which comprises of fingerprint and face lock.
As mobiles are the need of the hour of the present day life and require most of quality features, SamsungM30s is the best one to be used and trusted.( I have bought the opal black, 4gb-64gb variant for the record).

I am using samsung galaxy from very long time, the software optimization is wonderful and memory management is awesome for all the samsung galaxy device. If i talk about samsung galaxy M30s, everything is just awesome, sleek design beautiful look screen to body ratio is very good its 91%,display is wonderfull support full HD + and 4k video recording and figerprint and face unlock both are very much responsive it will not disappoint you. Battery life is very good but not as like 6000 maH it will last for the day 24-30 hrs of backup. Cemera quality is also very good but it should be little better as per the 48 MP.
But for this price range galaxy M30s is awesome device, in this price range you are getting bunch of features and that is provided by samsung brand with the trust of samsung.
Galaxy M30s is good choice in this price range.
If you are thinking to buy under 15000 then you should go for galaxy M30s blindly...this phone is far better from the chinese brand.

Since I have received my Samsung Galaxy m30s and after using this per a day I have found Camera, Network and battery Issues. Then I have connect Amazon technician and explain everything and they refuse to proceed return or replace because of their rubbish application called blancco was showing that my device performs properly. Now if I will not get return or replace this device I will surely go to consumer against Amazon and Samsung.

Samsung Galaxy M30s performance and battery life It gets bright enough outdoors and we did not have issues with sunlight legibility.Samsung Galaxy M30s offers a true 2-day battery life and with a triple camera setup on the top left corner and a fingerprint ...On the front, the smartphone gets a 16-megapixel selfie camera in the notch. ... In the daylight condition, the rear camera does outshines with the 48-megapixel lens. Also, the wide-angle camera does a good job. But the problem is with the low-light performance.It takes over two hours to charge the "monstrous" 6,000mAh battery, which is quite slow. It would have been nice to see a faster 18W charging support for the M30s considering the size of the battery.fingerprint sensor, which might not be the fastest in its segment but does the job of unlocking the phone without any hiccups..otherwise phone is good as my usage reviews..

1)good stabilization on video
2)super slow-mo is awesome
3)hyper lapse
4)wide angle video capture capability

cons:
1)no shutter adjustment for pro mode
2)no manual focus slider seen in pro mode
3)Super AMOLED Display, not as vibrant as other Super AMOLED Displays
4)6000 mah battery, for regular usage not getting a complete day
5)speaker at full volume making noise
6)heating while using camera
7)received without a sim ejector tool
8)back panel looks like  8 year old design

over all, not satisfied for 14k budjet. went for samsung brand but looks like mi note 8 pro is a better option for 15k

Phone doesn't charge fast as mentioned (very slow). 40% only charged in 1.5 hrs. Turbo chargers are supposed to charge almost fully by that time.
The battery also drains within a day even without playing high end games like pubg, asphalt, etc.
The touch doesn't work seamlessly while playing games. Have to go out of the game or wait for few seconds for the touch to work again.
Sound is very low compared to other phones. Alarm n ringtones are very feable.
The good thing about this phone is the camera  (wide angle option, selfie, photos) and video.
I exchanged my previous Lenovo phone for an upgrade but now I feel that phone was better than this phone in every aspect And I believe Amazon/Samsung will not accept refund through their so called blancco  app which has 1.8 star in play store.

Feel like my money is wasted on this phone because of false hyped advertisement.

The product has a lot of advantages and minute disadvantages
Pros
Camera Back : Good low light photography,good 48MP,Good Super slow motion and Slow motion Best live focus but people complain about it I don't know why may be they don't know how to use.
Battery: Monstrous and everlasting
Display quality: Magnificent and good Vivid mode
UI : Light UI and very fast too
Weight: Light weight and does not feel like 6000mah
Performance: Good speed no lags as of now l

Cons:
Front camera doesn't have much detail when zoomed.
Headset is available for A50 but not us.
Could have been much better if 18Watt charging was there.
Headset port is down so bit of inconvenience.

But the budget also must be considered and for this price this is a monster and don't think go ahead with it.

I am quite happy with the 'fingerprint reader'.
Camera is very good and provide self adjusting focus, video effects and stability. I used the mobile in extreme condition, I mean in my last Himalayan expedition in the month of Nov'19. I used the camera at an altitude of 5000m, guess what... It worked so well. Of course battery backup is quite handsome. For three days, I kept the mobile in aeroplanemode as there were no signals in the Himalayas, and I am surprised that, the battery did not draines out. Though, used extensively for capturing pics and videos. One more aspect was, the temprature was ranging -15 to - 20; but just with basic care, Samsung Galaxy M30s worked well with no hassels.

First of all, WHAT A PHONE!!. Samsung nailed every aspect of an ideal phone in a mid-range segment.
1. The screen FHD+ SuperAmoled screen looks so stunning and the deep blacks, the color saturation and the small tiny notch for the camera looks premium.
2. The back I've purchased the black variant having a dark blue gradient looks so much better than the other colors. I think the white will look great too.
3. I've opted for a 6gb ram and 128gb variant and its pretty snappy in terms of performance, although the 4gb ram variant will also do the work as the phone is having a separate dedicated slot for a MicroSD card.
4. The 3 Cameras at the back and the front selfie camera..The main sensor 48mp is a monster shoots so much crisp and detailed pictures . The wide angle although its an 8Mp camera but it takes pretty good pics. The other is the depth sensor helps in taking a pretty good pics. 16mp front camera takes really good selfies.
5. The final and the monsters part is the 6000mAH battery is the best part it's lasts for 2 days easy combined with the SuperAmoled screen.

Camera is 48mp for name only, result do not impress a bit. Also processor is very slow while I used the phone. Even 6000mh (I doubt claim) battery fails to impress, good for only a day and couple hours on medium use.Today on 15.10.2019 I took photos n videos from back camera. Bad.

I bought this phone for one reason. This is Made In India.

Picture quality and sound: V. good.  Matches Iphone X. I compared. :)
Battery: V. good. You can manage 2 days, if you are not on youtube whole day!
Processor: Quite smooth performance. No complaints. But not super smooth as you might expect from high iphone X or samsung S10. For its price range, I think, this is quite good.
Camera: HORRIBLE. PICTURES LACK SHARPNESS.  My 6 year old Samsung S4 with 13 MEGAPIXEL took better pictures!! Don't know how camera of phones from other companies in similar price range perform.

Amazing phone performance wise as well as feature wise.....
List of Pros is endless
1. A descent look very comfortable handling
2. Pack of features with one UI - totally customisable
3. Camera is great.....samsung always work on it for there customers awesome picture quality and camera functions are great in this segment range phones.....totally satisfied with camera but the front facing camera is not as expect as 16 mp it is poor quality
4. Battery - according to its tagline monster 6000mAh it lasts for 2 days easily with descent use I charged it just 2 times in 5 days
There is no disappointment titally satisfied with the phone

Cons is negligible
1. Fingerprint is little slow

What you expect in just 13999 and I bought it in just 11599 great deals on amazon and very fast delivery

3. For an average user the performance of processor  is great

Here is my review about M30s after one week of use .

PROS:
1)Good handy phone little weight but ok
2) Screen look good
3) Back case colour - black variant is amazing
4) smooth operating of finger print sensor and no lag in display
5) front camera is avg as expected with 16MP
6) Low cost if you have applied right offers

Cons:
1) Camera is worst don't go for it if your are buying it just because of camera 48 MP
2) 6000MAh battery can only withstand my 12~13 hrs of my intense phone usage (internet , videos ,chatting etc)
3) Need to be handled carefully

Have seen reviews online but i am not facing it
1) signal strength issue
2) internet speed issue

I'm using this phone for more than a week and enjoying it thoroughly...

Pros:
One of the biggest pluses is a 6000 mAh battery.
The display is really superb, they have integrated Super AMOLED.
The triple camera is doing a great job in daylight and a good job with flash during the night.
I'm playing games such as PUBG, SimCity, Asphalt9, Call of Duty and the performance is super. I haven't noticed any performance issues so far, but you can feel the heat from the backside if you play high graphic games for a longer duration.
The sound output is awesome.

Cons:
The build quality of the body is poor and should be handled with care. It can get scratches very easily.
We get below-average pics in low light conditions and noise can be noticed in moderate light conditions.

Overall, this phone does a decent job in almost all aspects and I would recommend this phone for anyone who doesn't have high expectations.

this is 3rd time I'm getting poor quality product in Amazon. this Samsung phone is getting heat within 2-3 mins while using,phone is getting hang frequently,speaker sound is low.
And request to Amazon team,Please try to provide good quality product to customer, if you sell these kind of poor product means customer will get disappointment and trust on Amazon will get damaged.
Amazon has some brand don't damage that name through selling these kind of silly poor product. I seems like theft customer money. Please replace this product with original product or refund the cash.

M30s has worst picture quality and a lag in other app operations.
Not a worthy phone which tells the camera is 48MP.
Pixels when u expand little, u will feel like it's 5MP old phone.
Pics in homelight and evening / night photos r even worse.
Spoke to Amazon customer care for 1hr and they even don't want to give me a higher value other company phone in return of this bad phone which will be beneficial for Amazon.
All the best for people who buy 48MP phones thinking that they will get crisp n better pixel photos. No. U will be dissatisfied.

After current service from Amazon, will shift to Flipcart even though I am a prime member. Anyway mistakes happen.

So next time anyone buys a phone, it will only be replaced with same phone if it's physical damaged and for other issues with phone u have to go to service centre. Learnings for me.

Samsung, photo quality is seen by clicking photos and seeing the quality, not by asking Blancco to do auto test and say it's passed if camera clicks the photo. Laughable. Grow up.

Its a nice choice for budget phone with good configuration, camera quality is awesome and really like it, but found few defects in Networks, the phone is not receiving signals properly and also breakdowns on wifi and mobile data, i enquired 2of my friends where the using same mobile and looks like its access all, so network bug is there and sometimes first call not hear properly you disconnect and call back will work, overall network receive issues, overall nice one apart from above issue

I am very satisfied with the product so far (after 2 days of heavy use), however there are few observations;
1. The supplied charger lead is very small. It is not even one metre. I had to buy longer lead. Wish Samsung were not stingy on this.
2. For transferring data and settings from old Samsung phone to this phone I couldn't find Samsung's "Smart Switch" App in Google Play Store for this model. It was available in Play Store for my old phone (Galaxy J7 Prime). After wasting lot of time in transferring from data from old phone I found that "Smart Switch" is hidden in "Accounts &amp; Backup". I wish it was mentioned somewhere in Amazon or Samsung web site. With "Smart Switch" I was able to get all my apps and data very easily from my old phone without any further hassle.
3. I tried to register the product at Samsung Website but couldn't do it. The model number SM-M307F shown in "Settings &gt; About phone" is not shown in Samsung Product Registration Page. When I chatted with their Online Human Assistant I was advised to visit the service centre.

1.Its display is not so good except night mode.The black letters on the white screen are not so vivid.Becuse the white screen is not so white to bring a clear look of the black letters on the screen.
2.Writting of a SMS when it letters increases it convert into MMS.,but it then cannot be sent to recipient though trying repeatedly.
3.In regard of phone size it is extra large in respect to its breadth.
4.I regreat that the display screen has been got scratch already which has not come to my notice when it was delivered to me.This scratch has come to my notice after 12 days from delivery when I was wiping the display glass to attach a temperd gorilla glass to protect the display glass.But it has already late,because 10 days was already passed from my date of buying.

The Samsung Galaxy M30S is truly a monster when it comes to battery and performance.
Smooth interface with switching apps or playing heavy games.
Monstrous battery with upto 32 hrs of mediocre usage after a full charge.
The camera quality justifies the specs and captures miniature details as well. All the photography fans out there, this piece offers every perk for a good camera phone. The most interesting feature is the super slo-mo. The selfie camera also offers a great output.
When connected with wired or wireless voice or music outputs, this phone offers Dolby Atmos sound quality and it is really amazing. Try listening to 8D sounds. You'll never regret the experience.
Smooth and hassle free gaming.
The facial recognition and proximity sensors work absolutely fine.
The only drawback is a slow to capture fingerprint scanner. Seems a bit glitchy but works better than other competitors at offered at this cost.
All in all, a definite worth at the price stated.

My verdict after 5 days of usage

Positive Observations
1. Battery performance matches expectations. It took 36 hours to drain from 100% to 15% when put to moderate use, keeping data on for entire time.
2. There is no lag in switching between applications.
3. You will fall in love with AMOLED display of this phone.
4. Touchscreen response is very  smooth and body size is very handy
5. At this price it comes loaded with a brilliant camera lens that performs well in low light also
6. Bottom facing speaker is loud and crisp.
7. Fingerprint and face unlock works seamlessly
8. UI is customizable, user friendly and easy to go

Demerits
1. The hardware quality is good but not certain of its endurance.
2. The blue back cover assembled over body chassis has some gap  below power button which stresses it inside (Observed in my phone)

Overall
One can opt for this phone as it comes loaded with features with Samsung DNA. Samsung has made commendable effort in bringing this amazing product to consumers.

This is the best phone that I've ever got till now..if ur budget is below 15k the best option for u is to opt for this phone. The first thing that made me fallin love for this phone Is the battery life,the charge almost goes for 1day or sometimes one and a half day...best battery life ever and second its camera clarity is really amazing...it has wonderful focus line ...and its finger print reader is tast and quick....in this current period I can say Samsung m10 or m30s is one of the best phones to opt for..I hate Samsung phones few years ago and was very concerned because of the worst reviews but now they have launched back the best versions of Samsung..I can date samsung better than an other android that costs below 15k as the  best phone..its budget friendly and u get everything u need...and yeah the look of Samsung m30s is just so sexy.. I love my phone..thankyou Samsung

You will read the Pros everywhere, let's talk about the cons here

Cons:

1. I had higher expectations from Samsung's camera, M30s doesn't match up to that with the 48+85 setup. The rear still scores 8/10 but I'll give 6/10 to the selfie camera. This should be fixed with a software update.
2. The phone looks premium. But I don't understand why did Samsung do the cost cutting on the box and cover. Silicon case cover have now become a default accessory and indeed very useful one. But Samsung removed it. Also the box of the phone looks very cheap from outside, I don't know why but i didn't like it in the first impressions.
Without the cover, i guess many buyers who purchased during the Great Indian Sale must have faced the issue on deciding which cover to buy. Also there were very few options available to choose from.
3. 6000 mah battery is a monster, but the phone charges slowly. i will take more than 2 hours for you to charge it to the fullest. They should have gone for the 18W charger here if they were planning to give such a big battery.

It was a perfect phone to buy in sale. Latest processor, huge baytery and great bezel less screen. There are many bloatwares in Samsung's latest software, but the phone is zippy so no complaints. Bought this for my mom and she loves the 2 to 2 and a half days long Battery life.

Using this phone since a week now

Pros,
Amoled screen (amazing display)
Massive battery (6000 Mah) 2 days battery life

Cons,
Charging time (2.5 hours to full charge)
Bad mobile data reception (slower than 3 years old MI phone on mobile data)
Started hanging on very first week
Camera not as good as 48 MP
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars

Bought this on first day itself!

Everything is good EXCEPT Camera: It is the worst camera quality I have ever seen. That doesn't look like 48MP
the output is very poor and when zoomed in, pic is not clear.

Also, While charging;  Half of the body HEATS UP soo much that I have to disconnect charging(fast charge is good though)

Finally, NETWORK ISSUE: I am using Vodafone 4G but network bars never reached above 2 level in my home.
Dont know what kind of cheap network hardware they are using just to cut down the cost.
It sometime hangs maybe because I have installed 15 apps.

Overall, its a good phone and I loved it! but please solve the above issues which will make it great. Thanks for reading...

Overall very good performance . Feels little heavy  and slippery.  Battery life is excellent.  I'm getting  2days with moderate usage. "Digital wellbeing" feature is good.  Only I'm not so happy with rear camera... pixelation and loss of details when zooming the pics. The quality of 48mp is not evident....previously  I used moto x play...even 16 mp pictures are of very good quality.  Probably i need to explore more of camera settings.

I'M rating this phone 1 star, on paper the specifications are really good.
Advantages -1. rare camera is really good
2. Battery life is really good
3. Screen quality is superb
4. OS look n feel is really good
5. Processor performance is ok
6. Sound quality is good

Disadvantages-
1. The mobile phone which I got has a problem with MIC,  who ever I am talking to are unable to hear my voice. I was under an impression that due to a network issue people are unable to hear my voice.

As Issue persisted I went to Samsung service center on 15th day after the purchase, they were able reproduce the issue and confirmed me that it's a defect.

They are not replacing the device and they are going to change the MIC, even though I got a defective piece ,I had to get it repaired due to their policy.

If Samsung really cares about thier customer, they have to help me getting the device replaced instead of showing the replacement policy.

It is my first experience with Samsung phone. Phone feels premium in hand and white color makes it unique. This new m30s is very much impressive with its great performance with screen, battery, RAM management, OS/UI and camera. We can call it a premium phone in limited budget,  hands on experience is good, not found any issues during day to day tasks, gaming and battery usage.  Camera is good enough ( some clicks are attached for your reference including night mode) but i expect more than what it has. I hope this camera quality issue can be solve in next software update. Here are some pros and cons that i noticed during my usage

Pros:-

1. Premium screen quality
2. Optimised UI for smooth performance
3. Good RAM management
4. Great battery performance
5. Overall performance is very satisfactory.

Cons :-
1. Front and rear camera is not that great as compared with same budget smart phone, i guess this issues can be solve with next update.

Battery is discharging  sooner than expected. Replaced piece twice but still same issue. Bought it based on youtube Reviews but all those reviews are fake. Total fake. Main attraction  for this phone is battery which is very disappointing  and heavy too.
Useless phone. Fit for nothing. I have no option but to use it as i have moved out of town and cant go back to return this useless phone.
Compared it with vivo Y19 and oppo A5 which gave better battery backup than M30s. Other small Vivo phone with 4000mah(dont know name) gave better backup than M30s.
Used this phone with MAXIMUM POWER SAVER and still discharged soon.
Trusted samsung and amazon for the first time and very Disappointing. Never gonna come back to samsung....IT PROVED ITS TROLLS.

Model that I purchased is smoooother like I wanted. No lag in Asphalt during play.
Camera build is also looks nice. Camera quality and images captured are very well in all the way.
Experience with Display viewing for high resolutions are good.
Internal memory is sufficient enough for normal daily use. If you are much app loading person then go for higher memory capacity varient available. My mobile is nearly 2 month old now and I don't have complaint till now.
Most loving thing is battery life I have experienced for this mobile. I don't have to keep charger with me daily. 1 full charge gives me more than a day easily without compromise in usage of mobile.!!! Makes my travel easier 👍

Thanks samsung for this model varient built 🙂

Starting from its look (External View), looking of Opal White M30s Samsung Galaxy is given black n white nostalgia feeling. Can easy handly &amp; very sensitive screen to scroll or touch. Flash &amp; Display is respond good to day/night. Internal view comes very friendly to me ie; if you are using for common purpose  i recommend M30s. Camera is good to this phone &amp; price , can take better quality photos. Battery its spanking one to M30s &amp; most powerful feature of this. I can use the phone for 3 days without changing all these days(not continuously but a day maximum of 8-10HRS). Softwares already install this phone is good for the safety of phone. So all the features in M30s Samsung Galaxy is above of 7.9 out of 10. Totally 93% good to common purpose of daily use.

I have been using xiomi redmi phones for last 4 years and i bought this Samsung m30s for a change and i found out a lot of differences. First of all the camera: the camera is not the best it takes good photos only in the day time and that too when zoomed looks like the pics are painted (not clearly detailed) and night mode is of no use. In spite Samsung is in the mobile industry for past many years it had failed to create a good os(user interface) lots of things like swapping apps is difficult, taking screenshots are difficult and you cant add more than 3 fingerprints you don't have a full fledged freedom of customisation available settings options are limited and the photos from wide camera lens looks like it is taken in fish eye mode. Aesthetics can br improved, menu bar can be improved and Samsung also doesn't releases frequent updates. But the battery backup is superp it has two sim slots and an seperate sd card slot and front camera and screen is impressive. I can't say this phone as best or worse but there are better options

For me,Samsung galaxy m30s is an absolutely brilliant phone with very well optimized technology in every features.I have used many low budget as well as mid budget smartphones for past 6 years,but I experienced m30s as the most finest smartphone yet(no offence to any brands).I bought it on 29th september &amp; got it delivered on 5th october,since then till now,I've tested everything in it &amp; experienced mesmerisingly woooooow....Every feature in this phone is impressively detailed.But the only incompletence I found is the super slo mo mode in camera,we can record upto only 1 or 2 second(s) activity with it &amp; the video automatically get saved.....Samsung could have extended the recording time duration of super slo mo mode.I humbly request to samsung if u can fulfil this only incompletence via a software update very soon.....

Samsung Galaxy M30S - Blue Saphire - 6GB variant is an amazing phone , the camera quality is very awesome, near or far and and it can record 4K videos, Super Slow-Mo and Hyper lapse . The AI feature is very nice to unlock using face lock and fingerprint is having faster response time, doesnt get hung. Lot of space for many apps and doesnt get hung. I had got mobile 3.5 years ago and compared to that, samsung is having less SAR value it came as a surprise to me. Type C charge is charging the phone very fast .  I had space issues in my previous mobile and it got resolved in this.

UI is not easy to use compared to Moto G5 Plus. 3 steps required to delete messsage. Need to go to clock app to set alarms unlike Moto where I could click on clock appearing on screen. Charging is slower and apparently battery life as well despite claims of 6000 mAh. Side swipe for more apps is not comfortable.  Upswipe on Moto G5 Plus was far better. Swipe dial is boring. Should be touch dial.

M30S packed with all features which we much expect in a smart phone;
1- Camera .. 48 MP camera gives you  better quality pics.
2- Battery.. 6K battry is real monster to back up for two days on normal uses
3- Charging..Type C Charging feature is awesome which charge your battery instantly.

The device is overall great, both its user interface as well as performance. Exynos 9611 has good performance- PUBG &amp; COD no lags! Some of the gestures of one UI are simply awesome! Night mode with matt tempered glass gives premium look. Charging is pretty quick. Home screen screenshot and some of the photos of the device are attached. Triple camera shots in daylight are good and night shots are decent with loss of details at times. Fingerprint reader is quick enough. The 6000mAh battery lasts 2 days on regular usage and can be extended even further using battery saver mode. Watched series for 2½ hrs with only 10% approx drop in battery on around 40% brightness during travel.

Be it MONSTER Battery which provides you that extra Kick to unstoppable performance of Videos , Net surfing , Social Media , E Mailing , Music &amp; the list is looooonnnggg..

Super Slow motion , Live Focus are something which are truly appreciable for capturing those GOLDEN MOMENTS.

I think i'm feeling Short of Words to Boast about this MONSTER @ the prices which are Super Affordable.

Must have for all tech savvy guys &amp; literally I'm in LUV with my 6GB+128GB Blue Beast !!!!

Display is outstanding , can be compared to s8 or s9 variant.
Build quality is not that great but can be used well with a strong cover and tempered glass.
Front camera needs improvement also low light photos is ok ok.
Fingerprint reader takes half a second response time.
Battery is amazing...it can give more tgan 10hr of ondisplay life.
Rear Camera is decent. It disappoints at some tricky lightening and edge detection. Video recording is very stable and can be recorded in 4k for front and rear which is dope.
For gaming like cod and pubg..it gives very high graphics settings..personally in cod i got the best performance on high graphics woth minimum battery drainage.( 10% in 1hr)
Rest for multitasking and daily use especially with 6000mah battery , this is a best choice at this price range.

1. Camera: quality ( 48mp) is so good . But taking photos by using 48mp camera it takes time to save the image. If you want quick clicks or action pictures you can avoid this option and choose other camera options
2. Battery: Earlier I was using 3300Mah battery phone the charge was coming around 7-8hrs . For office I use to bring chargers or power banks . Now this one coming around 14hrs .  This made me so comfortable.
3.Display:  looks so good looks like high range phones.
Cons:
The body of the camera is glassy. It's slippery.
They didn't provide any ear phone.
Request:
while launching new phones please add basic phone case it will be helpful because it takes time to get cases from market.

Detailed Review:

Camera: The 48 megapixel rear camera gives you an excellent quality as it captures beautifully in both day and night lights. Night photography is quite impressive. Front camera also takes beautiful selfies along with wide angle mode.

User Interface- User interface of galaxy m30s is really good but Samsung can add some additional  features such as making dual apps of any application, 3 finger mode screenshot.

Battery: One of the 2 biggest USP of the phone is battery. The humongous battery gives you real freedom  to enjoy your phone with heavy use as it last 2 days with normal use and 1 day with heavy use. Despite of a huge 6000 mah battery it really feels light.

Display: The Super Amoled screen is awesome and mind blowing. So smooth and gives nice feeling. Watching videos is a great  joy.

Conclusion- Overall Samsung has offered a great piece of mobile in budget with great features. It fits in hand and looks very beautiful. A worth to buy. 5Stars

I got the 18days ago.. sharing my experience of last 18days.. looks is subjective but for me it's cool according to the price as I got it at 11599.. Display is best in class in price..no phn under 20k has better display than this..I saw realme devices.. cameras at back are good as 3.7out of 5.. great dynamic range, pretty good details, night photos r not good, awesome portraits, average selfies.. battery is monster giving 10hrs screen on time 100to0%, charging time 0to100 nearly 3hr(less than), trust me one UI is way better than colors, I was a realme user.. it's a great package for multimedia users,(I don't play games so can't comment on that)

I used it 4 day's since I bought this phone. It's camera quality is awesome in both front and back camera's for better photo clicks. Especially it's back triple camera is the best part if you want to click photos with the wide-angle lens also better photo's in night mode too. It's 6000 mAh battery is awesome I used it for 3-4 days on one charge. If you're want to play big games like PUBG than this phone is made for you.
According to my review:
Front Camera: 4 star
Back Camera: 5 star
Battery: 4 star
Fingerprint Touch: 5 star
Super AMOLED Screen: 5 star
Processor: 4 star

2. No manual focus control in the pro mode of Rear cam
3. Super slow motion video is limited with a very short time &amp; you need enough lighting condition , but slow motion video is okay
4. Polycarbonate body, you must use it with a back cover
5. No notification led, but 'always on display' does the job better

## In this price range this device is actual beast ## Worthy purchase ##

Overall the Samsung M30s is the best phone in this price segment and it shows the better performance.
The fingerprint reader is very fast and I think it takes ½ of second!!! It is very fast than i thought. The fingerprint sensor can also control the notification bar up and down. It is  very useful to me.
The camera quality is very good in this price segment. I just loved it and it shows awesome performance in pictures and the quality. The video is also mind blowingand its super study mode is very awesome. Both front  and back cameras are showing very good results.
The battery life is very very awesome. It's above my expectations and really an amazing performance. You can't  carry a powerbank with this phone. Just simply put in your pocket  and walk away for a day and night. The M30s doing amazing battery optimization. I just got 10½ hr screen on time while playing pubg,playing movies and music,internet browsing etc. The battery life is awesome.
Then the display... its just mind blowing and amazing.  You can simply use it at sunlight.
The overall quality and performance of the Samsung M30s is just mind blowing and its very powerful in this price segment😍😍😍

It's absolutely an amazing handset. Especially 6000 MAH battery gives you the the best quality satisfaction ever...! I used lots of mobile handsets before, but not like that... Thank you Samsung &amp; especially Amazon India for bringing this kind of beast in my hand... 🙏🏿🌻🙏🏿 ...

The camera quality is pretty good, front camera is pretty decent too. The fingerprint reader is quick and good but the facial recognition is not that great, failing to recognize every 1 out of 5 times. There has been no lag till now in some light usage, screen is pretty good. But the phone looks delicate, no scratch protection on front or back. Battery life is awesome, takes about 2.5 hours to get full charge but you don't need to charge for almost 2 days.
Build quality is the only problem here, slightly on the heavier side, but the rest of the phone is great. Over all 4/5, and especially great considering the price for a Samsung.

Edit: Completed 2 months, 4.5/5 go for it.
All in place, awesome battery life. Takes about a couple of hours to full charge, lasts a full day on 60 percent. Face recognition is not as fast and accurate and I stopped using it after a month. Fingerprint sensor also fails to register sometimes. No complaints in performance or light gaming, haven't played heavy games. Camera performance really good.
Delicate body, have to use front and back protection, that's the only real drawback. Device feels heavy, but not uncomfortable.

After 3 weeks using, I like the product on this price range, but improvements needed on this mobile, 1st one, some times mobile going to hang, secondary camera taken photos are automatically rotating on whatsup applications &amp; 48 mp camera photos getting only in 3:4 mode, third one is mobile giving heat feeling on pocket, but charging time or using it was not heating... overall performance is good, but above improvements needed by immediate effect, I think it will be improve by next your software updating time...

Pros
Build Quality Awesome
sound is Crystal clear
Display is simply superb
Samsung is unique with its own app
Amazon was best with same Day Delivery
Phone is Very fast no lag in anything
Battery Life is 36 Hours on continuos 4G and extensive usage which is simply brilliant and upto now I haven't used such phone .Now no need for me to carry battery saver while travelling .
Cons
Camera is Good but considering 48 MP ,I expected more as Pictures are just like another 16 MP Camera only .
But I used Another camera app like Retrica and found pictures are more clear n vibrant
So is it camera app that Samsung needs to look into god knows but I expected it to be like DSLR only considering its claim of 48 MP
Few Clicks I have added
This is why I am Rating 4.5 Honestly .

Honest review after 1 month of full use:
Just next day delivery, I get this product in a good launch offer. After using it for 1 month I can say you, its worth every penny I paid for. Many people reporting about the camera, but you also understand the price of this phone.
In this price it is just unbelievable. Actually I can remember, last year I wish when I can hold a phone with 6gb, 128gb, over 40mp camera and over 5000 mah battery with 4k video recording. I can honestly tell you I don't think Samsung can provide this. I am really really happy and cannot think about any replacement currently.
Just one thing you need to keep in mind that the camera is not a true 48mp. It is a 12mp. But yes, this phone has a bigger size of sensor and camera size than previous m series phones. So pictures are just awesome. Again remember the price. You cannot compare it with s10.

Before starting the review, I would like to say the phone is worth every penny.
Hope this review will clear your doubts.

Pros :

1) The full HD+ sAMOLED display is fabulous and best in the segment(1080x2340).
2)  Battery is gigantic (6000 mAH) and more than enough for the whole day of usage.
3) 48 MP Triple is good enough, clicks great day light pictures(Refer to images I uploaded).
4) The performance of Exynos 9611 SoC is quite fast and the phone works smoothly during multitasking.
Gaming performance is also quite good.
5) Value for money.
6) Good design.

Cons :
There's nothing to complain about, but the only thing that bothered me in the beginning was its weight(188g), which is justified due it's huge battery size.
It's not that much heavy though.

I am using the phone for 10 days and I haven't  spotted any problem so far. The only thing is that camera quality although is good but it doesn't look like a 48 mp camera but it will definitely work.
The best thing about the phone is its battery life. Somedays I charge 30% of the battery and use it for my whole day doing basic work and realise only 3-4% battery drained.
The look of the phone is also nice. I would say blue color has the best look. Price is a bit high for this phone as you can get redmi note 7 pro at around 1,500 less. But its upon you whether to buy redmi or Samsung. In my experience performance wise redmi is just better but this has better look and also dependability of Samsung..

This already was a game changing device this festive season. When m30s was launched the specs were nowhere to be found in 14k and on Amazon I got it at 11600 which is crazy.
About Galaxy M30s
No forgery and fraud by Samsung,  they have delivered  what they promised. This phone has amazing camera , superb battery and mindblowing display. Battery really feels like 6000mah and the weight of phone is very impressive. Fast charging is also good , it took me around 21 mins to charge from 73% to 100%. I took some shots from 48 mp which were very satisfying and wide angle camera is also very useful. Fingerprint and face Id were also decently  fast , no complaints .If you are looking for a phone below 15k then this is best option to you.
Review after 75 days
Battery life of this phone is top notch and no complaints regarding that, I really liked Samsung's One UI over other UI like MIUI and even Stock android. Camera struggles a bit in low light and fast focus but overall no complaints in that too. No heating and lagging issues found so ever , thumbs up to Exynos 9611. Really impressed by overall form factor of the phone.....and last display is so crisp and amazing that you will start to hate other phone dispaly thanks to sAMOLED.

I got this m30s 3 days back. I was debating to buy this or a30s or a70s or a50. Finally settled for this with 6GB ram and 128gb storage.
So far, this has been a wonderful piece. No doubt.
 1. Amazing display.  You just feel like keep on looking
 2. Battery life so far which is too early is good. Charged 2 days back and had to recharge today
3. Facial recognition,  fingerprint recognition all are good.
4. Speed is good maybe because mine is 6GB ram.
5. Voice clarity is there but volume is less..that's a flaw
6. Camera is good

Overall this is a good one and I am enjoying it.

I ordered Samsung Galaxy New M30 on Prime sale with a view to exchange my old OnePlus. It took 4 days to receive the phone perhaps due to hectic sale season and also need to arrange pickup of old phone.

I was expecting a fairly bulky phone given the huge battery capacity and low price. The phone turned out to be sleek and very well designed. Configuring the phone was smooth and didn't take anytime!

After my first charge on Oct 03, the charge lasted for almost 5 days with medium use - calls, websurfing, some photos etc. The turbocharger is a boon to heavy users like me. The camera(s) is nice with terrific resolution.

The fingerprint recognition is a bit slow and needs 2-3 touches sometimes.

Overall, a very nice mobile at a killer price point for a Samsung device!

# There 3 things i like in this phone
1 - The battery  backup  of the Samsung  M30s is as said a monster
2 - The exynos 9611 chip performance  is satisfactory  and supports  Pubg in high graphics  settings and is seamlessly  smooth
3 - The UI of the phone  hives a class feelings  and is of a flagship level
# There are 3 things  i didn't like about  the phone
1 - The camera quality is not upto mark of 48 MP its its even worst in low light conditions to mention  there a wave like glick in fast movement of camera
2 - The build  quality of phone
The plastic body feels a bit off the trend and doesn't  give you  a great feel in hand ,even the volume  rockers and power button are cringy
3 - even though this phone is  a worth for price product customer has expectations from a global brand like Samsung  , not adding a mobile guard ,giving a low quality for low price doesn't meet standards.
Hope this review  was helpful
Ask is there's  any queries.
Thank you

In this price range if you go for Samsung brand the M30s is no doubt awesome.

Good Camera, night mode camera is awesome,  but the 48mp camera is just like 12mp camera. Battery is quite good as it is more than 5000mah and so that it takes 2.5-3 hour to charge 100%. OS is really fast and I am satisfied with it. front facing camera is average need more sharpness and coler adjustment. design is really better than this price segment. of course the back panel is made from plastics but the grip and design is good. face unlock is not working some time. fingerprint is fast. and the super amoled screen is too good.

I have been using galaxy m30s from last 2days.. so this is a first hand review and not an exhaustive one...
Good things: got my phone in just 1day, credit goes to Amazon
- look and feel premium, opal black color is amazing
- good touch response on screen and on fingerprint sensor
- actually the phone is light weight given it's a 6000 mAh powered phone
- haven't explored camera quality much yet so no comments on that..

What I didn't like about the phone is sound quality.. the music speakers sounds like some third grade Chinese phone.. I understand these days people use bluetooth speakers but once in a while if someone wants to listen music directly from phone that is when get unexpectedly low quality of music..

Apart from speakers I didn't  find any other problem.. in this budget I believe no other is available  with these latest features like 48 mp camera, top notch processor and monster battery.. real value for money product
Overall I'll rate 4 out of 5 for this phone..

Starting from its look to performance I'm toatally satisfied. Stunning style, mine is opal black, increase in slight thickness may be because of its monster battery. Battery life is immense, goodbye to powerbank. I charge the phone once in 2 or 3 days, Fully charges within 3 hours. Type C charger provided dead easy connectivity. Instead of  V, U display gives it sexy look &amp; more screen to body ratio.
Processor swiftly performs on vast games and  easily can switch between apps. Most important thing for me was its UI and graphics, I have succeeded in chosing best UI smartphone brand. Fingerprint reader lits up in lightspeed.
Camery quality is good compared to my friends smartphone bought recently.
Waiting for UI and oreo update.....

M30s display it's just mind blowing.
Specifically when I used device in sun light and when we see 4k or ultra hd videos.
Writing this review after more than 1 month,  mobile working good no hanging issue ,battery life also good front camera is ok but back is good . And finger print also working fine . So over all  it's good package in this price.

And believe me opal black color is just amazing.

This is really  amazing  phone I brought  it on Amazon shopping festival only for 12600. It is really  full featured smart phone. It's  battery  life is awesome I think  it's more then 6000 mah😜. And camera results are fine enough with 48MP. Processor  is too fast to operate. I more happy with the amoled  screen  cristal clear. Touch is also nice. Wile playing  PUBG awesome  experience  that never  before  in any other costly  smart phones. I am very happy  with my decision  to buy this phone 😘👌

Earphone &amp; back cover missing from box. Whereas if one buys from offline store same included in box as I found when I recently bought A30 for relative.
The quality of handset is too good. Display, Touch screen response, colour effects and the big one Camera quality are simply awesome.

Giving 1 star for it since the camera quality is not up to mark . In Redmi and relmi we get better camera phone for this price range. Rest features are ok but i expect more from a 48mp camera. Front camera also not good . My k6 power phone has better front camera comparing to this . Totally unsatisfied in this phone and not recommended.

All well as of now. Heating of mobile when heavy game play or high resolution video play over 4G internet.

Overall with this price happy to use.

Couple of points
1. SAR VALUE IS HIGH
2. TYPE C PORT IS LOW quality and could not expect long term like 1 yr

The phone is very nice. The colour opal black looks bful. Battery life is as mentioned. Works for 2 days even on high use. Camera is nice n clicks bful pictures. Front camera can be better
Games run without lag

Kudos.

The camera work is decent enough for this range..though the pro mode should also have shutter speed as an option. The live focus, AR Emoji are good and can be integrated with social media apps.

I have no complains with the fingerprint reader, it works just fine.

Battery life is good enough for my day activities, even though I dont play much games for which it has provided specs as well.. as of today my charge stays for 1.5 days for using normally when sim is not roaming. In roaming mode the battery life is more or less the same.

Buying out this phone didn't burn a hole in my pocket, also I'm quite satisfied with the performance so far.

I will give honest review about this phone
Everything is good about the phone like display is super, battery life is long but the only thing I didn't like about this phone is the camera
Camera sucks rear camera is fine but the front camera is worst..it doesn't look like a 16mp camera one of the worst front camera I have seen
I have used redmi note 4 and one plus 6t the camera of one plus cannot be compared to M30s but the selfies of redmi note 4 was much better than this mobile I am hugely disappointed with the front camera , detailing of the front and rear cmaera is also disaster
Please if you want good selfie phone then you shouldn't consider this phone as a last option
If you charge your phone from 1 % to 100 it is taking more than 3 hours almost I can say close to 4 hours is this your fast charger? Seriously samsung has fooled us by saying fast charger support I strongly recommend not to but this phone

The phone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity-U display with a screen resolution of 2340 x 1080 pixels. The display offers own good colour reproduction and viewing angles are good as well.The smartphone is equipped with a massive 6,000mAh battery and it comes with 15W fast charging support. The phone now comes with a triple rear cameras with 48-megapixel primary lens with f/2.0 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle lens with 123-degree FOV and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. For the front, it is equipped with a 16-megapixel selfie shooter. The daylight performance of the phone is good as colours came out to be close to the source and macro shots were good as well. The wide-angle captures a larger area.

Hi.
This phone is good overall by using, Battery life is good while traveling. If u use wifi or data pack according to the usage it will change for me it came 11 hours while by browsing. Screen quality is good for this money. Camera quality is ok and nice, By suggestion who traveling more using offical apps for businesses and working in phone it's excellent. I don suggest this phone high graphics games. Should keep the phone safe from children and by dropping  your phone by mistake because there is no glass protection for this phone. Buy good temper glass and case while you order this phone.
Thank you...

Updating my review after couple of months using this device.

A lot of problems detected like in USB port- it's stop fast charging now even its connected to its original charger, it's continuously shows USB connected and disconnected even if it's not connected anywhere by which my phone doesn't sleep anymore and by this my M30s's massive battery doesn't last long. It's other functions like sound and vibration doesn't work together even if its enabled by which it doesn't vibrate while ringing. It lags many times in day to day usage. And this all in just 2-3 months.
Camera quality is also not that good according to it's specs compared to its competitors.
It's fingerprint sensor is very slow and not accurate and sometimes takes 4-5 attempts to unclock or even doesn't recognize most of the times.

Overall Samsung's low cost phones are pathetic. They just wants to attract the public but indeed can't compete with other brands like Xiaomi or Realme or any other brand in budget segment. Don't buy this phone that's it.

All advertisements and YouTube reviews are fake. All of them are promoting the product but the product is not upto the level...

Don't buy any product without touch and feel .
Poor camera and camera software
Dolby atmos is not worthy. So music doesn't  provide deep bass...
Poor music
More bloatware and no premium apps..
Worth for Rs. 8000

I ordered Samsung M30s on the first day of sale on Amazon and writing this review after using It for 9 days, which is a pretty enough time to examine a phone.

Best Feature - AMOLED display makes the display experience great with exceptional clarity, 48 mp camera clear pictures with many effect option (common now a days), front 16 mp front camera makes selfy experience far better.
 Above all of them is battery capacity of 6000 mah battery, my personal experience with the phone that I watch three movies, played online card games(Consumes much battery) for three hours and some you tube videos (outgoing, incoming, camera usage are others) after all of these 25% battery was still available by end of the day to have some music in night.
All I can say about the phone that mentioned price segment It is the best phone with the confidence of Samsung and Amazon for great product and service.

Negative part : I did not find anything negative about this phone.

Guys I would like to correct my views. After using for nearly a month, I have forgot the tension of finding a place to recharge my phone. This phone really is the best in this range. Very good handset, very good battery, nice camera. Just go for it if you are looking for mobile on this range. Moreover its samsung, no compromise. Cheers!!

Best phone at this price range

 The design is very much impressive.and Samsung is really a trustable brand.The good things are the battery which last more than  one day of heavy use.The samoled display is very attractive.the finger print sensor is very fast.for charging it takes 2 to 3 hrs.
Camera is excellent at day time but in low light is not good it should be improved.selfie camera is not good it is average.good sound quality.video stabilization is excellent.the built quality is not so good as it made of plastic but ok  it is managed by buying good case and using a temper as no gorilla glass.ram management is good.good gaming with no lag.lowest head sar value is 0.468 which safe but body sar value is 1.13 this is also less than 1.6 so no problem.
Finall it is a best all-rounder in normal day to day usage

It's better than my expectation, weight of device is comparatively low if you consider 6000 mAh battery well played Samsung.

Smooth and flawless UI experience.

Wonderful gaming experience, battery drain of only 5% observed after playing pubg for 20 min in high graphics.

48MP camera at this price range, WOW. AR emoji to play with and "best shot" function to guides you take perfect shots every time you click. Night mode is epic, it has clearest night mode in this bracket.

Most of the times my hands arn't clean, face recognition comes in handy, fingerprint sensor is responsive but takes a while to unlock phone.

Awesome grip on this phone but I suggest you to have a back cover because of plastic body it is prone to scratches.

Free one time screen replacement(offer valid during Amazon sale), it releases the mental pressure from customer if screen gets damaged.

Go monster!

Iam using this phone from past 3 weeks and writing review based on my day to day usage.
Pros
Good battery life
Speed charging 1 hour charging give u more than a day

Cons
-Display is not as on the papers - not crisp display when you compare with MI A2 and other band products of same price
-performance is not good for 6GB RAM but really good for day to day usage
-Camera is average, even though it is 40+ MP clarity is not good, day light photos are fine some details are missing , you can observe it when photos are zoomed in, front cam is also average
One good thing is wide angle capturing is good in both video and photo.

I have purchased by seeing brand as Samsung and good battery capacity but not up to mark like other competitors.

Ordered this on Saturday (4GB/64GB) and got it delivered by next morning..
Being one of the early users of this Amazon launch

Pros
1) Looks (It's one of the sleekest design and weighs much lighter than similar models from other brands)
The Sapphire Blue (my model) colour is striking..
2) Great camera quality (Of course 48MP is a exaggeration maybe but then no phone camera can match up an SLR, espcially when shooting in the dark)
3) Fast processor
4) Ample memory
5) Responsive touch screen
It's a steal at the price it's on offer

Cons
1) No earphones in the box (but then most of us use our own prefered brands for earphones rather than the ones supplied)
2) The design is very fluidic but that also makes it more likely to slip and drop this model

The battery is a beast on this phone.
The phone performance is very good and never lets me down in any situationsl.
The display can be provided with a Corning Gorilla glass as we are not getting proper fit tempered glasses.
The phone feels weightless in our hands and have recommended this device to 15 friends and they havrle bought it as well.

Headsets can be provided by samsung as motuing matches its quality.charger wire length should be increased as it is short and at times finding it difficult to charge on certain places.

The color produced in this phone is excelent and viewing pics or watching movies is jus amazing..

Samsung..keep up d good work and Amazon delivered it on time as always.

Bought Samsung M30s in the launch offer, highly disappointed with the product, was facing slow charging issue with 1st 10 days, couldn't lodge within cancellation period, also faced frequent restarting issue, took to service center &amp; they said, charging board had fungus &amp; demanded replacement charges, had to explain, this was a new phone, less than a month old &amp; finally agreed &amp; resolved the issue. Now in March 2020 5 months later, similar issue prevailing, frequent restarts &amp; never switches on most of time, before I could take backup &amp; try factory restart, the phone became permanently dead. Such a faulty product delivered by Amazon from this Vendor. Due to lockdown, unable to take service center, now from 5 months to 6months period over.

Hi Guys, I am editing my review. This is Genuine review guys.. please read before go for this mobile.

I have bought this against all my friends advise who had very bad experience with Samsung. I have been using this mobile from last 24 days.
From day 2 onwards this mobile start giving problem to me. It keeps on restarting itself for every 2 to 3 hours. After 20 days mobile stopped working. Nothing was working, it was only showing some encrypted message. Then I went to the Samsung service center and got repaired. And  I lost all my data, photos, files which I carried from my old phone. This happened just within 20 days of time. I don't know how many time I need to go to service center in future.

Guys before you buy this mobile please make sure that you have service center nearby, please do not trust this mobile, any time it may give hand, please keep file securely and have a back up.

Again Samsung proved that they can not give quality product.

Amazing phone at this price tag.. just awesome.. Only 2 things disappointed me.. First the speakers, sounds distorted at high volume, and headphone availablity in the box might have proved Icing on the cake.. But overall its a value for money phone, bought 2 in quantity one for my mom and one for myself.
And last but not the least, I thank Amazon and Amazon Delivery partners for timely delivery.
Regards.... ♥️

In all aspects this is a awesome mobel from Samsung within Budget. Especially battery backup is very good. Even after using phone in office for 5 to 6 hrs for watching videos and attending wedex calls , by the time of reaching home 60% battery is available. AMOLed dispaly is excellent. Low light photography is working perfectly.

Manual focus option could have been given as in phones of same range like nokia7.2
Super slow motion videos are limited to 8seconds
However slow motion capture at 120fps can be taken for longer durations
Grainy video when taking videos with steady shot enabled @1080p
Pros:
Display is good
Good battery life. With standard use, easily comes to 2days
Good processor
Supports streaming of FHD content on Amazon prime video
Dolby Atmos gives a superior music experience
Camera produces good images with near natural colors as what we see with our eyes.
Overall it's a good phone at this range.

What's the point of giving any feedback.Does it even matter? Well if it does than i would like to give the worst rating to this product plus amazon who pretends to put his customer satisfaction at first. Don't buy this product because it's not worth the value. Bad camera quality, only in a couple of minutes it can become a heating device. And the best part is even after having so many issues you are not able to change it because according to amazon policies you are not supposed to exchange the product even after having any difficulties with the same. So i am writing here, in case anyone read it please don't buy the product and get fooled just like me. Needless to say that, shopping on amazon and being the prime customer for a long time and this product gives me right now the greatest dissatisfaction.

Best mid range smartphone with a brand name.
Pros :
A massive battery 6000Mah !
Exynos series 9 processor is truly a beast .
Triple camera setup with 48MP as primary lens.
One UI is lit !
Timely updates , android 10 on the way !
Best display in this range totally satisfied.
System wide dark mode.

Cons :
A bit heavy in weight and slippery.
Night mode is just ok , still not expecting much from a 14k phone.

If you are looking for a mid range phone just go for it without a second thought , honestly I used nearly every brand mid range smartphone but you won't be getting that smooth experience in any brand mid ranger.

Attaching some shots on 48MP camera config.

This is the first time i am reviewing a product in Amazon though i have brought 100's of product in amazon.
In comparison this product can't beat some other mobiles of same price range.
1. Camera no way close to 48 MP quality.
2. Battery is 6000 maH but still get drains fast. i charged 100% and by 22 hrs it came down below 10% even after not playing games, no much use of youtube and other stuffs, usually i experienced battery remain is between 20% to 30% in 5000 mah
3. worst part is it gets hang in some instances, even in regular app like call, msg, whatsapp.
4. If you use mobile keeping screen downwards i.e facing ground, than screen touch doesn't work properly.
5. Volume is also low

Overall bad experience. Better options available for 13k -15K in market

The phone is over all fantastic but the texture of the finger print sensor feels like cheap plastic and not intact with the device, when I touch it, it feels like shaking.. Although I presume it is not a defect but its just built that way. Whatsoever it is not a big issue and I am satisfied with my purchase, it has super amoled display over a 1080×2340 resolution screen which makes the visuals absolutely stunning. The camera quality is pretty standard for Samsung quality and the battery backup is just EXCELLENT !! Once you charge it 100% it would last the whole day regardless of constant usage. So overall its a great experience with this phone and I would prefer everyone to buy this product whom are looking to buy a phone under 14k.

For me every is ok(because believe Samsung), except  one the fat body  and fiber  body.  If Samsung  can change  it . Little  slim and metal  body.  Then will  be super  star mobile.

If Samsung  not giving  headset it's ok. But in alternet  way if they  give  mobile  covers.  Then custom will really happy..🤔🤔

When my old phone started dying, I decided to get a new smart phone. The Samsung Galaxy M30s was the one that caught my eye for a number of reasons.

First of all, I consider this phone to be excellent value for money due to its high storage capacity, security functions and the display quality. For me, the specs are as good as I would expect from much more expensive phones. Another reason it is light weight to carry around. I am not keen on bulky phones.

However, as far as I am concerned, the best thing about the phone is how easy it is to operate. Personally speaking, it suits my needs as I can watch high quality videos and click good quality pictures with the camera.

All things considered, I believe that this phone is the best value phone in the market for its price and specs. I would recommend it as it is both user friendly and affordable.

My m30s is having heating issues after 30 minutes of YouTube video session, 15 minutes of video call. I cannot  place phone near ear during a call. This is very bad part of samsung..redmi phones are far better than samsung..I never faced heating issue in redmi phone..very disappointed with the phone quality. On top of it while in roaming, internet access  issues,  to use internet  service I have to every time restart the phone.

Very bad phone from Samsung worst build quality till from Samsung... if you don't mind about build of your phone then only you buy it else go for glass or metallic build phones
I have been Samsung fan for a long time not now come on Samsung you can do better v all know...
Pros :-
Display is gorgeous
Battery is true Monster
Cameras are ok
Processor is fast hangs occasionally
Charging speed 2hr 45min
Cons :-
Worst build quality compared to even budget phones from Chinese vendors it's true wake up Samsung everyone's watching
Hope Samsung can make glass and metallic phones also in budget.

Battery life the main usp for this phone as mentain by samsung but in my case battry is not so good as samsung say.
Camera is 48 mg pixl but failed to captute decent photos like 48mg pixl.
sAmoled panel is superr. Samsung did it again
One UI is far better then the chinese phones offer...
Over all a good product. At this price point from samsung but as they marketed this phone not all the features are A plus.

If the camera had been better its a super phone..

Nice budget mobile gives Premium feeling in terms of display.Quite satisfied with it.One cons is tha its network reception is poor in some areas  than other mobile.For which samsung should work on in.Otherwise if a person is not camera centric want good display n performance then it is quit upto mark.

To start with about this phone, I call it "Perseverance"

Camera: Clarity simply neat and non blurry and the maximum out the lens. The combination of different lenses are accurately aligned to better visibility and capturing the right moments.

OS: The manoeuvrability of operating system from apps to apps and resources utilization is perfectly calibrated. There is no lag found in using this phone.

Battery: This is something to believe no matter if the phone provides big battery will it supports all the apps whos utilization varies or can suffice to make complete phone. But this proved me wrong and has given back up more than day.

Overall this phone is phenomenal and perfect value for money. Recommend to go for it without any hiccups.

Samsung definitely can give more better than what is available right now. Samsung had already earned huge profits since starts and now it is time to give best phones to India. They shall deliver better products to India. Thanks for giving opportunity to provide feedback. Overall, Samsung M30s phone is better but not best in the given price. Samsung shall think to provide metal case to such phones in the cost as it is necessary for safety.

Pros : Battery power is awesome i have not charged the phone for 2days and it is still with 28% charged
Camera quality is good but in lights ok in average room light
Phone is with latest version Pie

Cons : 10% of ROM memory occupied without any file been there that ouches
Also 2 gb is free from RAM out of 4 gb that so without any application running
But still that is not giving any lags issue it might ne because of pie

Honestly this should be a buy product for every one as the battery is good and some small small classifications and graphics of phones are good
Samsung had worked pretty good rather than selling cheap phones like MI woth various issue

Pros
1. Display quality is great.
2. Battery is monster as Samsung claims. It lasts very very longer. No need to wory after full charge.
3. Fingerprint reader is ultra fast.
4. Phone design is stunning.

Cos.
1. Camera quality is very poor.
2. Getting usable RAM lesser as compare with Redmi. When all apps are close it gives only 2.5 to 2.7 GB free RAM while Redmi gives 3.9 GB.

Overall very nice product in 15K. I would definitely recommend this product who are looking for good battery life and fast and premium brand. And camera lover should avoid this phone.

A monster mobile with monstor specifications but miniature pricing. This beast easily beats all the high end mobiles of other brands and its own other variants in various specifications like camera, battery and the pricing. You can close your eyes and purchase this mobile, you won't regret it for sure.

Finger print reader ,face recognition are fast, uncompromising battery life extremely satisfied, front cam gives little sharp images, live focus and wide selfie are  ok with front cam, should have given the notifications indicator led along with front cam face recognition blinker. Weight is also fine despite 6inch screen, overall I am satisfied with the phone which in the budget.

pros: very good screen. Samsung is unbeatable yet. fast 7 responsive. Camera is good. However, Samsung has tied up with some israeli company which gives app recommendation. i think it is an unnecessary bloatware which Samsung could have avoided. Default call volume is low. main purpose of phone, making and receving phone calls is met. Huge battery life. Camera is OK.

There are some sample shots are provided which have clicked from this phone.
Note: For Redmi lover, This phone is not made for them.

Very vibrant Display. Everyone loves this screen (Best in this range of phones)

Sound is good (Dolby Atom is supported in earphone &amp; bluetooth speaker only).

Fingerprint and face unlock work very well and fast response.

Battery life is very good with good processors.

Product is Heating, Sound quality is very very Poor, sometimes noticed lags.  I have raised a return request, but the Amazon did not accept the request, and when enquired next day they mentioned they did not receive the request it is very  REDICULUS NEVER EXPECTED THIS FROM AMAZON, I feel as the product is not good / failed the expectations of the consumer, they are intentional doing this.

Samsung Galaxy M30s is a good  phone can purchase in all level of customer. Have maximum features on 15000 rupees. Each of features has its on specialty compare to other phones of this range.
Physical view.
Standard view is attractive one of m30s
Display
Extra ordinary display effect give m30s. Samsung mobiles also bring up there on display quality, it's very attractive on here.
Internals performance
Camera: compare to this tange of mobiles a moderately good one. But tha low light performances become a negative on m30s.
Fingerprint: performance is good.
Internals memory: give a good experience.
Graphical experience: good one.
Battery life: A massive battery life adopted by m30s it will a best of uniqueness. Two days long life on a continuous use. Charging time is 3hh.

I was using POCO F1 and it died in a heavy rain. I initially wanted to buy Realme5 pro as these brands give top specs at low price. Later decided to try this one for the Samsung brand and AMOLED screen. Now I am really glad, the phone is really awesome. The one UI interface is very user friendly and flawless. I used to find a bunch of bugs or possible improvements in my earlier phones. This one is top class, shows the value of brand. Looking at battery spec of 6000 mAH, I was worried about size and weight. But this phone is incredibly handy, and needless to say the display is top notch. Camera shoots great pictures for its price tag, battery easily lasts for 2 days and no lag so far. Aur kya chahiye....

Pros-

1.super amoled display is great
Battery is not that great(being a 6000mah battery)...bt enough for a day's use
2.UI- ONE UI is surprisingly good,simple and smooth
3.Price-11600

Cons-

1.Poor build... the back plastic makes a CREAKING sound.... gives a very cheap feeling to the phone
2.Cameras- the cameras are very disappointing
In good natural lighting... the camera is ok...but at ok lighting n indoors... quality of the photos dips...
3.Speaker sound-Speakers sound is pretty bad...we need to keep the volume above 70%... below that... Its almost like inaudible

But still I wanted a Samsung phone.... this does all the job ok... And at 11600 this phone has the BEST DISPLAY... and that's what my priority was...

Good product with great features at this cost. Go for it. It's worth for 17k. Excellent battery life(48hrs plus battery life in single charge) and greatest display with high quality. Sound quality is good along with excellent processing speed. Inspite of continuous usage, the phone is not getting heated up which is great stuff from Samsung. Good for gaming too. Camera features are good for this low budget. Can expect betterment of camera features in upcoming updates. Overall it's worth for your money!

Very good product, overall value for money. But who wants best camera will disappoint. Camera image quality is not as good as claimed by samsung. It is like 12Mp point and shoot camera. Iso sensitivity in low light is very poor. Colour contrast is not good. Overall don't buy only for 48Mp camera. Exynos processor is very fast, but not compitable with snapdragon. But in this price range gives best performance. It beats all compitator in this price range of all leading companies like MI, realme , vivo. Amazon didn't provided invoice with product which is not justifiable.

Pros
1. Display
Samsung always had the best displays even in the budget phones.so this phone also has an super amoled display which is so cool to use and when playing videos.
2. Battery
It has an monstrous  6000 mah battery , so you don't  have to worry  about battery  life and it also has an fast charger.even with playing pubg I had battery  life for my other daily uses

3. Camera
It has an 48 mp shooter which is very good
It clicks awesome  photos in daylight  and night.
4. OS
Samsung UI is very good to use and it's  fun
5.value for money
You will get value for your money and a premium feel

Cons
1.processor
The processor  is good for many things but it still behind SD 710 which is provided  in this price  segment. But you will not feel until you are a heavy user . But exynos9611 performance  is pretty good

The most important function has gone missing. The phone latches to network very badly and I can see this for sim and WiFi also . In same place I change my sim to old sim I can make a call properly. In M30s it's just showing network but no calling possible. Same for WiFi. In a corner of my home where WiFi strength weak my old phone works like a charm. But here it just show connected but not able to use internet. Very disappointed

I love this phone and i dont even think that in future samsung M30s will disappoint me because its amazing phone of this budget and its even givea premium feel while running this phone.

Now, talk about camera so its has fabulous  48 mp camera the photo is so clear and i haven't found any problem with camera its works fantastic.

If we talk about Battery life than we are just insulting or disrespecting samsung M30s literally it has 6000 mah battery or we can say the father or grandfather or battery which give me very long battery life and even if gets low after long time then we have the fast charger which never let you stop to play game or watch movies etc.

Screen quality is amazing which gives me fabulous screen resolutions for pubg and by the its give high by default in pubg and i play in high quality and its not letting me down and watch 4k vedios you feel what 4k videos are. So i give full marks to screen qualty.

Samsung M30s giving heating problem. While call it may heat to a point that you have to remove it from your ear.
@Amazon team,  please replace my phone asap. As today it is confirmed  by your representative  that its giving a lot of heating.
As per safety concern I am writing  to you. Kindly take action.

Very good phone for the price point. Great battery life and a good camera. But the build quality could be better - can't ask much from a 18k phone though. The UI is good and the features on the phone are pretty good too though the finger print reader could be a little  better. The camera too isn't a true 48mp and u can see its shortcomings in dim lighting. But for the price no regrets
..very well done by Samsung.

The display, UI and UX of the device is phenomenal. But the fingerprint sensor is a little slow compared to other budget devices of the same range and even lesser. The 48 megapixel back camera produces sharp images but the 8 megapixel wide angle lens doesn't perform the best and produces bearable images without distortion correction, so the edges might be round. The battery backup is totally the strongest usp of the product as even on heavy usage, the phone lasts for a whole day and on normal use almost two days. Also the phone feels hefty in hands but not at all heavy despite of the 6000mah battery. The phone feels quite premium as well because of its gradient finish. Overall its a good budget phone to go with if you are looking for a device which is under Rs15000 and packs some features of a high end flagship device.

Super product. Exactly as was expected from Samsung. Specs are really good though yet to try out the camera especially at night. Will update subsequently on that. However bloatware is an issue which Samsung needs to look into. Otherwise the android experience is very good so far.

Display is good,
 camera is worst, samsung used to had better camera in 5 and 8mp camera and in m30s this is 48 and of no use.
Battery is mentioned 6000mah, but works like other 3000-3500mah
And worst thing is fingerprint sensor that is super slow, even sometimes  doesn't work.
No protection on the phone, plastic body.
Even not a scree guard provided with the box neither any kind of cover.
It takes 2and half hr to complete charge in flight mode.
Plz don't buy. Samsung is just a brand which is fooling you just to gain the mid range smartphone market.

Samsung is back in the midrange smrtphn segment ..with all new powerfull processer fingerprint reader is very good ...battry backup is fantastic with all day heavy usage u will end up around 30- 40%  camera is also very good even in low light it take very good pictures  but  i hv noticed some kind of  prblm in camera aftr clicking photos  like it take some time in saving the pic. Slow motion and camera stability is fantastic.....but there r so many smart features  embedded  in it ..  like u can play video  in some prt of the screen while using other app ....  and ye it heat up little bit only whn u play 2 to 3hr continuously  heavy games like pubg and call of duty......  screen  quality is  super

Worst camara result
Never expected this kind of camara in samsung mobile.
When I took image with 48mp camera, image quality is too bad.
My oppo mobile's image is better then this mobile images, even when my oppo mobile has just 12mp camera.

After using Samsung phones for more than 10 years, this time I was about to change the brand. But at the last moment the brand loyal soul of mine awakened and again I went for Samsung.
If you are on the move then this is the phone for you. One hundred percent charging will last for 1 and a half day. If you find to get 10 minutes of charging somewhere then that will further extend the life. I am not a photographer, so hardly use the camera. But the people around me who are camera crazy say that the picture quality of this phone is superb and features are also commendable.
Happy with this phone.

Good battery - with full day 4g usage + 100 mins of call battery stands for 36 hours

Fingerprint - sensor is good, but not convenient to access since back side.

Face un- lock -- works fine

48 MP camera - 3 camera backside with and 1 front camera. However nothing special compare other smartphones.

Software -- version update comes up to date on date, however bit hangs.

Overall worth for money and battery life gives comfort of daily usage.

My M30s is working decently well.
Even though there is a little issue with fingerprint sensor as it sometimes doesn't recognize my fingerprint which is annoying sometimes but cleaning the sensor or finger or both will solve the issue :P
With a long battery life and good processing speed.. there is a very little lag in touch response ;p  but the screen quality is good though.
Coming to back panel you need to worry about it being plastic as you anyways getting a back case.
Regarding camera.. you can see the pics.. taken with nomal and wide-angle lens and you can see many more on Instagram where people showing exceptional photography skills ;P
If you don't want mobiles with random adds I would suggest to go with M30s
On over all in my opinion I would say it is value for the money.

I am a fan of mi phones but Samsung has started to bring in more value for the same cost. Best in class software but bloatware would occupy some ram automatically. Camera quality is top notch but have to adjust few settings from default mode.
Update after using for 2 months- quite slow than redmi note 5 pro, adjusting images/blur is torturous...regret my decision to go with this phone

Recently I bought Samsung galaxy m30s handset. Mobile is looking very pretty and back side color is very attractive.  And about finger print reader backside finger print reader is ok but little bit slow. It is taking 3 to 4 seconds for unlock the mobile. This is one unsatisfy thing and next one is about camera. About camera front camera is 16mp and its it's working very good and very clear. And about rear camera. In rear camera given triple camera setup. First one is 5mph depth sensor and second one is 8mph for portrait shot and last one is 48mp. Main camera 48mp is ok but portrait shop camera is not that much clarity. Photos are looking like blurry. But main camera is ok. And last thing is about battery. First of all I would like to thank to Samsung for battery. Battery is very very good. Finally mobile is ok but please update the fingerprint sensor and rear camera also. Thanks for this opportunity to Samsung and Amazon.

The mobile built quality is awesome. It feels like premium handset in hand. The Super Amoled display is of extreme great clarity and sharp and crisp.The Battery is huge and there is no need to buy a power bank. Inspite of huge battery the weight is comfortable in hand.One can easily rely on this battery for long travel or drive without worrying about Charging.The charger charges the battery superfast. The fingerprint  reader  is quick as rocket.The camera truly delivers to its promise and the extra features of slow motion video and super stability is icing on the cake.The pictures comes bright and crisp of both front and rear camera.The processor does its work pretty well be its gaming,net surfing,media playing without any lag.The decision to buy this mobile is one of the best decision  I have taken in recent days.Thanks Samsung India for bringing this handset for all masses in budget along with all features. 10/10 by me.

Got this phone for 13k (6/128) with Bank offers. I would say it did justice to its price.
This is not a gaming phone or processor, it is  meant for average day to day usage.
sAmoled display is at its best.
Build quality is a tad on lesser side, could have been much better even with plastic uni body.
Camera is decent, but there is room for lot of optimization and improvement. Hoping Samsung to provide OTA update improving camera quality.
Overall a good phone for average usage. All the cons in this phone has been mended in Samsung M31.
If you want brand Samsung and
ready to spend around 15-16K, you should pick M31
want to constraint expenditure till 13-14K, M30s is the one for you.

Samsung has come up with an amazing and superb performing phone with this one. The Battery is a 6000 mAh monstrous with two days backing. Camera quality is good with great rear view day pics. The Front camera has some glitches which I hope will be corrected with the next update they give. Super Amoled Display is an amazing addition to this. Gaming Experience of this phone is also good if not the best. All said , this phone is a steal deal at this price... As I said , it's like Gold being served in a Silver Plate. The polycarbonate cover instead of glass is being criticized but to make a 6000mAh Battery phone look so light is a difficult task. It has been made of polycarbonate cover but the strength has not been compromised. A definite YES for this one... ✌✌✌

First of all this phone looks like the one which made in hurry  ,All catchy words doesn't match the performance. monster ,super fast charging and 48mp doesn't really show up in actual.  Closer camera shots looks great but not longer ones.  One day battery life and needs 2 hr for full charging which you can see in other mobile's also.  I am using Samsung sd card  , but still it takes lot of time for reading the content. All features in this m30s can be found in 8k redmi mobile.

First of all I liked the amazon delivery.
Now overall samsung M30s is nice but camera performance is not in Google AR program certified and result of photo taken by M30s clearly noticed the difference from A50s camera photos. This A50s camera 8s Google AR program certified and results is obvious better.
It is all good with premium feel but only I want samsung must get Google AR certification for M30s to get best through updates as the camera specifications are same in both models except selfie camera and also Android 10 updates / out of box is missing, while most of midranges to premium phones in market is flooded with latest Android 10 out of the box.
Hope M30s buyers will be provided the same in time.

Using this M30s since 30/9.So far it's good to use.By seeing this mobile it's hard to believe that it's price is just 13999.Display is amazing.i have watched 1080P movies on this it amazing.In prime video you will b played HD videos by default as it supports it.  Battery as they said it looks like monster.
With1full charge it I'll b with u for 1&amp;1/2 day for sure.Camera front one is good,but the rear camera is awesome I just loved it.finger print sensor is good as I have enabled facial recognition it unlocks my mobile so quickly.
The only con that I noticed is this mobile has poor signal.Before switching  to this I was using Moto i use to get good signal even when I was in home.But in this one I couldn't  get proper signal.It just frustrate me I could barely get 2 points in both the signal box's.Hope they I'll rectify it with an update.
This mobile is superb I just love it 😘😘😘

I purchase in offer time for 15thousand, 6gb ram and 128 in built memory. I always like samsung due to no heating problem. Good price. Thanq Amazon and samsung also.

I have used this phone for quite a long time now. I am well satisfied with the phone. Phone is light vis-a-vis the 6000 mah battery. For normal use it last ito 2days. For heavy gaming to the battery is great. No problem of over heating.. works cool.
Regarding the processor, it is smooth for normal use. No hang still now. Can't compare with mi a3's  processor, but it's good. I have tried playing pubg, and it was smooth.(not smooth with high settings.there are frame drop)
Camera: For normal lighting condition camera is very good. No over saturation and provide decent pictures. The wide angle lens is not the best, but it is good. Detailing is less. But for night mood i think there should be more improvement. It is ok, but not the best.
sAMOLED display is just awesome..
Speaker is loud enough
Call reception is smooth and no call drop.
Over all if you ask me  to recommend it , i will give you a 👍

As the specifications are mentioned they are not as much good in terms of the quality and are notworking properly,
Cons:
Incase of mine I received a damaged product having internal crack on the selfie cam lens
And the earphone port was working properly.

Comming to the camera,the 48 MP didn't have proper detailing and seemed to be like a normal 12 MP camera. The front camera is having the same problem...detailing are missing and the pics are extra soft...
Live focus mode in both the cams fails in good edge detection.

Battery life 1.5day being an average used with moderate gaming which is similar to 4000 mah battery.

YouTube and Facebook crashed on the second day of usage...repeated crashing of apps.

Pros:
Good display as all time favourite,  vibrant colors
Less bressels and wide display

After using Samsung M30s for about 15 days I am writing this review. I would first like to highlight the battery life. 6000 MAH is the best in class.
1. Display quality is very good. (The S AMOLED Display).
2. Camera is very good. The special thing about this mobile is that even night pictures are equally good. The triple camera is excellent.
3.Processor is also working excellently. No hanging issues while multitasking. Also the storage is great (64 GB).
4. The last point and the most important is the price. The phone offers great value for money. The specifications that we get at this price are awesome.

M30s is just like a hulk.  It has great power as hulk in the form 6000 may battery, it's dumb in some categories again just like hulk. Yeah now I'll talk about those weaknesses and strengths.
First, strengths
1. Battery: it just gives 8 hours of sot. Trust me I'm a heavy user. Data/WiFi 24/7
2. Display: super amoled screen is just fantastic.
3. Processor: I never faced any lags im having a smooth experience so far.
4. UI: I really like one UI so user friendly.
5. Finger print sensor: fast and recognises wet fingers too.
Weaknesses
1. Camera 3/5
2. Sound via speaker 3/5
3. Sound via headphone jack 2.5/5
4. The plastic body it is so clickable just like volume buttons. No good feeling wen we holding it in our hands

Finally, this phone is for who cares about battery backup and smooth performances and great display quality.
Not for music and camera lovers.

The phone is good, considering the price. The amoled display is amazing and it looks even better with a matte tuffen. The 48mp camera is not actually 48mp. However, the clarity is still good.
The phone does heat a little whilst playing pubg but then again, most phones in this price range do.
Besides that, the functioning is smooth and upto the mark. Moreover, the onterface of oneUI is simply fantastic!

Overall, if your budget is less than 15k, go for it!

Due to extended battery life, the size of the phone has been designed too big to handle sometimes. Camera quality is quite good in the price range. The quality of the phone is as good as every Samsung phone (my first phone was a Samsung in 2009).

Camera is hopeless.Its not 48 mp.pictures are not sharp and clear

There is some network issue also,notifications especially of whatspp, are not delivered promptly.tried all possible settings but the messages/notifications  are delivered only on opening the whatsapp.some basic features like contact shortcut,screenshot with ease are missing. Could have done if i had not bought this mobile.

I am dividing this review in pros and cons
Pros:
1. Great display superamoled, brightness is very sharp
2. The usp of this phone is it's battery, Great battery life it will give you around  1 and half day usage if you are a average user.
3. Great camera, saturation is nice and not overexposed pictures. Good camera.
4. Gaming performance is very good. But let me clear i am not a gammer, so for me the performance is very good.
5. One UI is best. Top class ram management and very great UI.
6. Before update the fingerprint was laggy but after October update the fingerprint became faster than before
Cons:
1. Night mode is not too good. But yeah does the job.
2. Sometimes at ultrahd pubg lags.
3. In 48 MP camera mode it takes time to save.
4. Littlte bit heating issue after playing PUBG at ultrahd.

Don't ask about display &amp; battery because no one can keep up with Samsung displays, even apple uses Samsung's display, &amp; battery backup is more then enough for day to day usage.
Now about camera, when you use 48mp then we get nice quality photos specially in daylight (i shared sme samples)&amp; normal camera isn't bad either but if u want camera for night photography then you have to compromise little bit for that but its also works great.
&amp; the most favorite feature in this mobile is dark mode, its soooo coooolll
.
(Everything is according to this price segment)
This is best mobile.
I loved it.

Excellent product from Samsung.
Highly recommended guys.
Batter life is just awesome.
Don't wait. Just buy. It's worth every penny 🤩

Prons :
1.Battery backup and life
2.Super amoled display
3.Fast charging (15w)
4.Samsung's user interface
5.Headphone Jack (which most of the new models don't provide)
6. Lightweight even though it's 6000 mAh battery
7. Pocket friendly (value for money)
8. Super studymode in 4k
9. Night mode
10. Fast Face unlocking even inside the dark room

Cons:
1. You will have to buy headphones, back cover and template glass separately (not inside the box)
2. The top ear speaker could have been louder

The battery life is around 24 hours on heavy usage..
The camera produces excellent results..Depth and Bokeh effect are as they should be and not overdone.
Night mode is pretty good.
And Video recording was great..with stability .
The super AMOLED display is extremely vibrant and produces a kind of depth effect which I didn't find in other phones..the display is one of this phone's best features..
On the negative side..I found that the phone lags a little..
The charging time is 2 and a half hours.
There is no notification light..but for me personally I would prefer a phone without a notification light
Overall..i found that the phone was pretty good.

I was pretty confused  between Mi Note 7 pro and Samsung M30s but finally took the plunge and went for this phone.
To my surprise, this  phone turned out to be an amazing one. This is not the "Old Samsung" which  had battery drainage issues etc.
They are actually able to provide incredible  features be it the Software or the Hardware.
The phone  is sleek and premium and the screen quality can easily  be compared to One Plus or other mid segment phones.
The battery!
Monstrous  power backup is what this phone claimed and hey! It's  actually  living  upto it's  expectations. I am able  to use it for almost 30-32 hours with  a single charge with heavy usage and for about  2 days with lite usage.
It's worth the buy. And you can now trust it blindly.
The camera could  have been a little  more sharper.
But the phone does get a 5 star from me for being  a complete package.

Overall performance is good. Display is just awsome. Camera quality is also good, but in low light condition sometimes it struggles. If you are a hardcore gamer I dont recommend you this phone, but you can play pubg in smooth ultra settings easily. Battery is not upto the 6000mAh. 1 to 1.5days it survives after modarate use. Charging time is also very high almost 2.5 hours is needed to charge this phone from 0 to 100, atleast it should have to support 25w charging for this massive battery. Fingerprint is ok. Face unlock is also good. One UI is just awsome, but some features are missing for M series phones than A series phone, but you will experience a premium quality Samsung phone in this price range. Thank you.

I just bought my Samsung Galaxy M30s from Amazon ordered on 28th September and unexpectedly received through Express delivery by Amazon by 4.00PM on 29th September. As soon as I opened the box I was surprised by the looks. It is elegantly designed with nice curves and very easy to hold  and  operate with  single hand. With Emoled multi touch screen it's an amazing device. It has three rear primary cameras 48mp+5mp+8mp with wide angle and a 16mp front selfie camera which gives  her crisp and clear pics. It is capable of recording slow motion videos and have many options to edit different situations. With 6GB Ram and 128 GB it's nothing short of performance or space. Samsung Galaxy M30s is the amazing device best among the newly released mobiles in the similar range and segment.

Crystal clear display.  Able to see in daylight outside also. Sound quality  good. Easy to  operate.  Good photos. I purchased from Amaz got 10% discount. Amazing set at the price.
Alaram: In my redemi if the alarm is set, and mobile is switched off,  the clock kick starts the mobile and rings. M30S that facility is not there. Secondly,  selection of alarm every day puts it on all seven days a week. Similarly switching off prompts the choice for one day or all the days of week. It can be introduced in M30s. I think it's just software modification.

To be honest, with this price tag this product is a clear winner in its segment. Talking about pros- hefty battery pack which provides you peace of mind specially while travelling long distance, look and feel of this product is also fancy and niche, High processor boost its maneuvering, last but not least it is Brand value which also kinda give edge to it over its kin.
Cons-1st, Although it has 48mp camera but still lags slightly behind than its competitors when we talk about quality, however having said it, this difference is very minimal hence would not loose any marks. 2nd, slightly wider built which was not in the case of its predecessor M30. But then it gives you wider visual screen as well. So no deduction in points.

Overall, value for money.

How all the features you get in m30s is quite good like value of money, coming to following
1.camera - live focus is amazing, but 48mp camera is not that much worth as I compared the quality of the photo taken from m30s and MI A2 was kind of similar quality
2. Battery life is very good, last for 3 days from the day I plugged.
3. Body/layout is super good
4. Charger - the charger is to small want Samsung to make it look like a long one.

I am always look for more battery so I have chosen Samsung M30s bcoz it has 6000mah.
But after purchasing this mobile I totally disappointed its coming only one day and I have installed very limited apps, No game playing and hardly I will speak 40 min per day even though I am getting 22 to 24 hrs.
Previously I had Honor 8x having 3750 mah battery but I am getting 2 days of charging with high quality camera.

1.0 out of 5 stars

The phone was delivered within 20 hours of purchase, thank you so much Amazon.

The Pros:
Very good camera, pics I clicked proved that I did good decision buying M40s
The battery stays 2 full days on normal usage
The screen resolution is absolutely awesome
The processor responds pretty well and did not notice any slowness in last 3 weeks
The screen is broad and gives a good feeling watching videos
Not very pricey

Cons:
It's quite big to hold and to carry
Feels heavier
Colour options are limited, wanted a plain black, perhaps comes with green gradient

Fingerprint could have been awesome like Poco F1. The battery life is so good that i cant even imagine the phone like this and the back camera is excellent. It takes best photos from back camera, i would say quality one photos but the front camera is not best. It would take photos but not the level, a quite decent one. The overall performance of the phone is flawless and if i have to give the rating for the performance and the processor it will be 11 out of 10  because i very much like Exynos processor. Hope to get the regular updates on this phone so that it will look like new phone and compete with the newer versions that are in market. I am happy with this product. THANKS SAMSUNG FOR THIS GALAXY M30S. I dont even need memory card. No hang on this phone i am using this from approx 7-8 months...

A powerhouse of a cell phone with excellent capability to capture the most vivid pictures with 48 MP camera in even low light condition. The body is sleek , processor is fast and phone response for fingerprint reader to multi window options is terrific. Huge power backup is a great relief and allows one to freak out without bothering for a drained battery. The best part is cost versus resources packaging..a full 5 star for that as so many hi end features at this cost is a great buy and of course one has the brand name associated..SAMSUNG...all in all a real SWAN SONG for the season..a Must buy hence is the Reason..

Been using for a week now and i had to say it has slightly more pros than cons honestly. Let me sum up real quick:-
Pros-
1.Great battery life (6000 mAh)
2.Video recording is better than i exxpected, picture quality is great too, but recording video is better.
3.It feels premium, the camera cutout is rare and very satisfying.
4.Display 10/10.
5.Also very great on gaming, PUBG Mobile can run smoothly on Extreme Smooth settings at a constant fps.
Cons-
1.Heating issue while charging.
2.Long loadings on some apps (need snappier updates).
3.The box does not include a case and the 18W fast charging brick which is very dissatisfying.

Mobile is working superb so far.
Battery backup is enough for a day or 2 day depend on usage.
Camera quality is up to the mark.
RAM and processor are providing smooth performance and helpful in doing work efficiently.
Overall performance is fantastic so far.

phone performs well.but the main drawback was the build quality. there are no cons in this phone.everything seems be excellent. for gamers it's very satisfactory....it has good chipset. we can control our frame rate in game launcher and adjust our graphics too.the battery is so freaking.if u want some extra fun for games then i prefer for 6gb rather than 4gb.display is excellent.we can easily use in sunlight without any cause.it has inbuilt discord for gamers.no heating issues better than comparators. personally i prefer wifi for gaming.it is the best budget smartphone.
cons:build quality is very very poor.

No doubts an amazing phone.  Does everything as advertised. However if one needs 6000 mAH battery,  that person will would already be carrying a battery pack.  Probably 5000 mAH battery would have been enough.  This would have made the phon new slimmer,  lighter and more manageable.

Samsung Galaxy M30s is really monstrous phone.
I like the swipe feature of notification  in fingerprint reader.
It give ultimate experience of Gaming by providing exnoys 9611 fast processor.
Optimisation of 6000mah battery is very good.
Its provide high quality of image at all type of light, but the live focus feature in camera is out of galaxy, mean to say outstanding. Its emoji feature in camera is also new one.

Super amoled display of m30s provide premium quality in phone, which will changed the viewing experience.

M30s provide the split view, pop up view &amp; one handed view, which is intersting.

M30s had ultimate feature

At lowest price segment M30s has the ability to beat the premium quality phone.

If M30s provide the Corning gorilla glass protection than the phone become the number one in the mobile phone industry.

It is one the best device within 15k segment. Super amoled display from Samsung is very good I used other Samsung devices too, but the most impressive part of galaxy m30s is the battery life it is really really good. Camera's are not up to the mark but yes in daylight it takes decent pictures. Gaming performance too isn't bad, actually it runs well apart from the fact that it heats slightly after playing for 1 hour or more. But the performance never decreases. The software experience is very good too as typical one ui gives. Overall a very very great device on this budget.

M30s is faaaaar  better than all Chinese REDMIs  &amp;REALMEs .

Points to be considered -

1. Superb display.. sAmoled display really looks premium.
2. Best battery life.
3. Super smooth performance #Thanks to Exynos 9611 processor. No LAGGING.
4. Camera quality is also good and is comparable to Redmi note 7 pro.Best in daylights and also good in night mode.
5. Best UI .Samsung's one UI is faaar faar better than MIUI .

6. The most important of all points . LOWEST SAR Values (0.4) .Don't fall with illiterate  people's reviews who dont know about SAR values. Almost all  those Chinese phones have SAR values over 1.0
.
So, M30s is safest phone. NO ARGUMENT here.

JUST GO FOR IT.

I am using this phone since last 3 days. Did heavy works and gaming and checked each and everything.  Performance is too good. Finally,  writing this review.

Positive:
Awesome  screen
Nice battery backup
Speaker and sound quality is good.
Nice speed
Nice Camera

Cons
Worried about screen. Previously I was using oppo which have very strong screen with nice pre applied protection.

Verdict: Worth for money.

Don't go with silly comments:
1. Somebody written in review Samsung  committed for 18V and given 9V. Please be careful while writing, Samsung promised for 15W charger not 18V.
2. Camera is very poor. Please check photos in laptop screen after all settings.
Even iPhone also have grainy  pics when zoomed.

Overall very good, rather the best I have bought so far, value for money.
Overall appearance: Excellent.
Handling: Very smooth
Speed : Super
Camera: Very good, I am no expert in photography. But does a good job in all conditions. Has lot of tweaking.
Battery: Massive 6000mAh is the reason i bought the phone. Lasts two days for me with plenty of WhatsApp, telegram, twitter. And plenty of call.
Call quality: excellent.
Only con is a little slippery.

After using so many phones since this is the best phone I ever had.

Guys believe me, This is an average phone don't expect  an I phone at this price range. Battery back up is just like a normal phone, not like 6000mah. Camera in day light good,but at night just average. There is a grey problem of range, this mobile is picking up very less range compating to my honor phone. Connectivity is also slow comparing to my honor. Display is good. So guys it's just an average phone.Dont fall in Gimmicks.

Best build quality sleek and smooth os.
Camera best in day light than non other brand,I haven't  yet made a picture in night light.
You can note the colour crispness seen as in original.
Depth of the camera is simply awesome you can see it of that flower pic.
Battery life full 2 days backup even when data is on.
Finger print and face recognition is at the best response.
Sounds are clear even at crowded places.
It takes 2.30min for a full charge from 0 to 100.
The notch which is present is so beautiful when the notification lights glow.
The screen saver pictures are awesome which are upto date and gives the current news in a flash on the display.
Over all a good phone at this price range.

Purchased in exchange  with Redmi Note.5
My Samsung  phone after last 3 phones with different  companies.
Afyer 3 days of use:
# Very sleek design
# Giving  a rich feel and look in your hand.
# 48MP is an awsome camera
# Battery nosed really  a stronger,  using  2 sims with 4G network  really  withstanding much longer  and I got rid of looking  for charger  everytime  when using  dual sim in my earlier  phone.
# Lightweight  , you won't  feel any difference  than your existing  4500MAH battery phone, its just 187 gm
# Dolby is always good.

$ Samsung  only have to work on more simpler  form of UPI. They should  study more on competition in this front.
Since they have worked  on features  and price ratio Very well.

Experience is Awesome..As of new this is the complete package one is looking for. Camera quality is great, gaming is smooth, battery backup is more than required for a day. Dolby atmos sound is nice via head phones. Attractive Display comes with insurance.
You shall choose this model if you are looking for mid range phone with full of features.

It feels good while holding this model in hand.

Conclusion: It is a complete gadget. Go for it!!!

The phone is good , battery backup and standby time is best. At the end of the day,after doing heavy usage like browsing , social media and playing heavy games , this phone still has 60% battery left.
The only thing I didn't like about the phone is it takes 2 hours and 15 minutes time to charge the phone from 0 to 100% despite provided with a fast charger

The product was delivered on time. No damages. Could have been packed well though. It was just sent witht the original company packing and no additional casing. Might have the risk of getting damaged while shipping. Rest, the product is great. Large and crisp display.

This is my review after 5 days:
1. The battery life is the best. Lasts for at least 1 and half days. I have observed that after every 8 to 10 minutes 1%of the battery decreases. If u play Pub-g the battery goes down by 8%-10%
2. The Camera is not the best in the market. It's just for casual photos.
3. The processor is the best of its kind in this price range.
4. The screen being an amoled one makes it easy to use.
5. Charging takes a lot of time. So if you need a phone which takes less time, this is not recommended.

But overall I liked it!!

I hope this is understood by everyone. And one more thing, if you try to use in an intense manner lasts for a day or so.

Unexpected error came in device. The screen turned all black with error message. This was captured from different phone and shown to the technician. Some of the apps turned like corrupt file. I have invested 16999 and Amazon is showing reluctance in replacing the device. I am insisting for replacement of the device as I am worried if the same error screen comes again in future. I am looking for replacement but Amazon people keep making efforts to convince me through technician visit, One technician visit has already been done today but maybe he didn't conveyed my points properly. I am not happy with the kind of approach, If I have incurred money why should I bear with a product with issues. I am just looking for replacement not interested in technician visit again. If Amazon cannot replace my device within replacement window of 10 days, It's a bad experience for me.

I'm quite happy with battery and user interface and new features like picture in picture, screen zone etc. Excellent battery life. Super quality display. At last some customizable themes and UI.
Rear Camera is just average and can't compete with many phones in its budget. Selfie camera does under performance.
Still I'm satisfied with the phone.

A good handy monster to control all your requirements.

Pros:
1. Excellent battery 2 days for average use
2. Crisp and bright display.
3. Premium look.
4. Good processor
5. Fast charging

Cons:
1. Camera quality always an issue with Samsung.
2. Slippery when operated by one hand.

Overall a good product to buy if you are not a person who expect DSLR images with mobile camera.. value for money in midrange phones.
Purchased it at 11.5k during great indian festival.. Thanks Amazon.

Overall at this price range the phone is an excellent purchase.
The performance is good. You won't have any major complaints with it. Good for gaming as well as normal use too.
Battery is the best part of this phone.
It comes with a lot of features and provide a premium phonelike quality.
If you're looking for a camera phone then it's not the best pick also the selfie camera is below average.
I got the retail model for 11599 and It's a steal deal.

Most worse product by samsung.after using one month.i am writing this...........first of all its both front and rear camera is very bad. They make customer fool by asking that it has 16 and 48 megapixel cameras............and the worse think is its network problem.i am replacing the phone with other phone and has the same problem.............so highly recommended not to buy this phone.

The phone is really good, specially the sapphire blue colour. Battery life is amazing,  I mean, I play games,  watch series apart from using it for calls, messages and photos and listening to songs, after all this the battery works for good 2 days even after that its still have 15% charge everytime so no doubt the battery is really amazing.  Coming to the fingerprint lock, its really good as compared to other phones available in the market in the same price range. Front camera is really good but what is a bit disappointing is the back camera, despite being 48Megapixles it does not capture good pictures. Over all if we talk then the only disappointment I have is the back camera which is really not upto the mark. Rest everything else phone is really a monster with amazing 6000mAh battery  :)

The mobile is rubbish. but the display is super. When you watch HD videos its just great.  The phone hangs a lot, heats a lot. Multiple application usage makes its hangs to the worst. Its just 6 months of usage only. After the latest update the notepad is also not working. The camera is worst. not at all quality. don't buy such scrap phones.

I've bought this mobile a week back.  I'd share my review with the 1 week usage.

Pros:
1. BATTERY as it says it is worth it for the battery life,  you don't need to plug in ur charger daily.

2. Display it is crystal clear and the touch sensitivity works well

3. Biometrics working very good as expected you ll love it

4. Sound design is good and decent that is advisable for a mobile phone

5. Brand value as it says Samsung, it is definitely a noted point.

Cons:

1. No details on glass protection
2. TPU case should have been added in this time. Bare mobile gets slippery while using

Overall a very good product from Samsung.
Ppl who looks for battery, display,  brand must definitely go for it.

before bought M30s I was used Samsung C7Pro with bsnl 4G sim and net speed was so good. But now Samsung M30s net speed very slow network coverage very poor by using same BSNL sim. And screen side view worst negative reflection is there. Compare to this 17000/- phone  were realme 3pro or redmi note 7 pro just 11000/- range of phone is very better in screen clarity and internet speed.

Worst thing is I try to call Amazon or seller  customers care person regarding late  delivery
of my SAMSUNG m30 mobile but can't talk with any customer  care person directly or there is
 no options  to speak directly  its very disgusting and not prestigious for this issue even in chats categories  also we can't type our issues. This is not good.

Specifications of this Samsung M30s is good, but it's only in Description not in Mobile. Waste of money after 10days of use. I bought 6GB Memory and 128GB storage.

Positive feedback:
@Display is good
@Processing speed of course is ok ok.
@Multitasking okok
@ Battery is good and battery backup almost 2day for normal use.

Negative:
* Poor front camera quality
*Little heating problem
*plastic body
*Touch screen slow (Gaming )
*Screen refresh rate not ok (feeling 20)

Over all budget mobile with normal use.

At top of my mind, after  using M30s for more than a week I can say that it's relief for money well spent.
With 6000Mah battery you can never go wrong, M30s battery does last for all your tasks you can think of, either using it for daily calls or video / audio playback,  or some heavy gameplay, it handles task very smoothly.
I opt for 6gb ram and 128gb storage space veriant, its a steal grab with current offers Amazon availing with this Mobile.
Performance and quality of Front and Back camera both are very consistent and stable, colours are tends toward little warm than bright or cool, which I think I can tinker with from settings. But overall good performance at price tag M30s is offered.
Lastly of processor and bells and wistles, M30s does covers all my needs to the point, though NFC functionality for this Mobile could have set this piece at Monster level for me.

This smartphone is a beast there is monster battery 6000Mah
Camera quality is awesome you can blindly trust on Samsung camera
It comes with good packaging
Face unlock and finger print censor is also good
Overall product is worthy by this price

The finger print reader is conveniently placed, I have small hands but can reach without straining. Works quickly unless your hands are wet, which is true of most readers.

The battery life is phenomenal, I really love not having to worry if my phone's on 46% when I leave in the morning, have stopped carrying around portable power banks entirely! Has three default power modes (customizable) the strongest of which gives you the barest minimum functionality but stretches the battery life to 5+ days, on just phone, messages, and browser.

Was afraid to switch from Motorola to Samsung, but I do NOT regret it! Excellent phone!

Overall: A very good deal.

Cons: Slow finger print scanner, front camera misses flash. Night mode photography is not that great.

Pro: Very good battery life- at least should last 1.25-1.5 day after heavy usage; even though not a 25/30 watt charger charging time is pretty decent.
Even though having a 6000 mah battery you can't say it is heavy.
Form factor is good.
Camera quality is decent. Live bookeh, wide angle works well.Slow mo, and super slow are acceptable. Hyperlapse is average.
So far no heating issue is discovered.
Tried to play Pubg at highest settings.Ran smoothly.
So far no nuisance of add from Samsung is encountered, thanks Samsung.
Last but not the least, display quality is awasome.
Mine is a 6gb version. Bought at 1#5#3#0#0 at Amazon big billion day sale.

In a word great. Should definitely buy.

It's been 2 weeks now that im using the new Samsung Galaxy M30s. Here are the Pros &amp; Cons:
Pros
1. Camera's awesome. Hell lot of options to choose from for ur photos.
2. Rich feel of the handset overall with an amazing screen ratio.
3. As always, Samsung's UI is worth a praise. Extremely friendly to use with good navigation to choose multiple options in regards to basic user settings.

Cons
1. Handset seems heavy to use at the start but one gets used to it over a period of time.
2. Samsung praises this model for its 6000mAH battery  however even with basic usage (zero gaming), the battery lasts only for a day n a half.
3. A bit overpriced if one were to buy this model out of Amazon Festival.

Camera quality is very bad and fingerprint not working ,heating problem is very high. Hand set is not good as per given so i want to return this mobile. Regarding returned i have many raise and check your agent your mobile but till time problem was same so I want refund

Got the phone about 2 hours back. So far the phone has impressed me apart from the fact that the body wasn't rigid. The sides of the phone seem to be making a clicking sound on pressing. Not sure if i should be worried about it but apart from that, the phone seems pretty good.

Edit: Got the phone replaced! Phone is completely worth the price :)

Interface needs improvement. Some of the most important features are missing.
1. When we get message for OTP, we get the option as mark as read or delete the message. The most important option is option of 'copy OTP' which is missing.
2. There should be option for display of data speed in numbers like given in battery charged in percentage because in India there is acute problem of getting a constant data speed.
3. Option of display of daily data usage is also very important in India where telecom companies are providing daily limit of data usage.

These are few very small but important features very useful to the user.  It will definitely make it more user friendly if you update your interface with these features.

Overall good. I'm using this Mobile  since last 3 weeks. It shows great performance  in battery life. Without compromise battery will lasts  for 2 days.
As it has Amoled screen  video quality  is superb.
In camera performance it is good but you won't feel it's a 48mp image . Ram management  also good.
The only con what I observed is  it not upto the mark for gaming.

Finally, if you want to use this mobile for calling, watching  videos and browsing net and listening to music I will defenetly recommend  this and you won't regret what you spent on this.

But if you are a gaming lover (like pubg) I won't recommend  this. You can Choose mobiles with snapdragon  processor .

Hello Amozon
I got my Samsung m30s yesterday morning itself but before opening the shipment the phone box seal was already opened so I thought I could keep it return but after opening full phone box the phone,charger,cable was all ok.
But coming to camera quality and sound quality was totally different its nothing but blur pics .so I went to croma electronics and saw the difference between A30s and M30s.
A30s camera,sound,display quality was 100% better performance than M30s why like that.
I didn't thought like this service from you people. Now I want to return my phone at any cost ok so plz do clear that.
And one last thing the rightside back panel of phone which downwards frm lock button was slightly defective because if touch the panel it goes in and out please I got my phone in net cash please kindly accept my return request ok please I beg u guys ok.

1.No doubt it is monster of battery.
2. Camera i find little more then okay just because profesional mode gives only limited options. In low light cameras go crazy...photo looks like oil painting in those conditions.
3. Fingerprint sensor is good.
4. Fast charging works fine.
5. The major problem i find is that proximity sensor doesn't work properly. I've replaced the set once and the new one came up with the same problem. This is somewhat irritating factor.
6. Playing Call Of Duty (6/128 variant) with medium graphics quality and the response is very fine. No frame drops are seen till now.
7. Overall a good product instead of proximity sensor and lack of pro mode options.

Amazing Features - Battery is huge, you can survive a day even with 25% battery. 100% easily goes more than 2 days for me.
Phone is fast, storage is good. No complaint so far since last 50+ days of usage.
Make In India working well for bringing down price for quality products like this.

The sleek and smooth design of Samsung m30s adds up to the brilliance of the technology it showcases in its every bit.
Going up from its superior processor speedto excellent quality of Super Amoled Display,it sets a hallmark for upcoming smartphones with a great level of functionality and enhanced features.
It is having superb quality of camera,both front and rear,smart capturing modes and better-than-life quality of display,that just adds up to the crunch of goodness it can shell out to genuine users.
I give it a good amount of credibility for all features, if one is looking to buy a wholesome phone in recent times.

It's a worst mobile i had bought.
Camera of that megapixel calibre should take more good quality, it's a worst quality i had seen.
Internet 4g signal reception is bad
Wifi signal is pathetic, we should be close to router then only gives grat signal as compared to other Mobiles.

Firstly thanks to samsung for lounched exclusive mobile in online with superb features.
Buy blindly without any confusion because phone belongs branded king samsung. Instead of going to buy unknown brands (because of cheaper with compitative features) samsung is the best option. All features are excellent and best part is gaint battery for current generation usage.
Thanks to samsung.......

Screen quality is amazing
Literally no lagging even with lots of software and heavy usage
Camera quality is exceptional,if you hold it steady while clicking picture/video
Only disappointing point for me after 5 days of usage is battery, expected to cover at least 1.5 days

At first the battery was working fine and after a few days there's decrease in the battery backup
.
Fingerprint:- It's not at all comfortable. Everytime it says " Cover the entire finger" .

Camera :- it's a bit difficult to get the image focused. And sometimes the low light photo is bad

Heating:- I installed COD and Pubg but when I started to play it for like 5 mins it's getting super hot .

i buy m30s phone there is a big issue, only indian sim is working at present i'm in Saudi Arabia and saudi sim is not working, when i complain amazon the are not take any action regarding the issue they said contact samsung also the same, if anyone purchase a phone it means they can use any where (International)  but samsung and amazon they said working only in india, before if you purchase from india you can use indian sim then you can use any internataional sim it was working that time but now no more international sim card working in samsung be careful one more thing amazon not mention on the website it will work only in india, really i feel cheated.

If you are looking for generic phone usage with 15 apps and phone with good network reception then it's good. Major issue is once you are in full size video no way to go back until you press power button and come back.
Price wise good purchase. And Samsung brand promises present.
If you just need to live with limited opportunities go with it. And battery life no much difference between m30 5k and M30s 6k

Being a CS(Company Secretary)student, i dont really play games alot, so this revie is not in that aspect, being a mid range phone you get a lot more than you would actually think.
●Camera-attached some pics with same locations and diff camera settings,colors are really vibrant, and the pictures it clicks are crystle clear. 9.5/10
●fingerprint nd facial rec.- works like a charm in a split of seconds ,even the facial recognition works in total darkness.10/10
●design and built quality-9.5/10
●processor-for my use-10/10
●batery-obviously 6000 mah works for atlest 2 days even after streaming 3 hours of content per day-10/10
●fast charging- 6000mah battery charges in 2.5 hrs, what else u can expect,9.5/10
Overall,I'll give my galaxy m30s-9.8/10, best phone with loads of features for a student like me,thankyou samsung.

The phone is awesome,
1) Camera - The images clicked are beautiful &amp; sharp. The wide angle camera is the best part as it works even while taking selfie so you cover your entire family or team in selfie
2) The speed is very good
3) Screen Colours are always best in samsung only after using almost all other phone including apple

Cons -
1) Battery life is slightly tight however it covers full 24 hrs average, but with such a phone i believe it will normal as many applications like whatsapp/facebook/email etc continuously drain the same

Overall i will recommend the phone as 1st priority, as this gives a tough competition to many other big brands flagship phones

I'm writing this review after using the handset for 20 plus days. Previously I had a moto g5 plus with stock rom experience. I didn't prefer Samsung for it's slow touchwiz UI. But the One UI used on the phone runs smoothly. Camera is good, though it takes some time after capturing in saving photos. Best part is display, you would love to watch movies on this phone. Fingerprint sensor is not very accurate as it takes time to unlock the device unlike Motorola which unlock in one swipe. Battery backup is really good. With around 67 percent juice it lasts for 2 working days of normal usage. Overall it is value for money. You can go for it without a second thought.

Proud owner of M30s.Reminds you of good old days of charging once in a week.well it doesnt run for a week but battery is good enough to run for 3 days with mild usage and 2 days with heavy usage.I am corporate professional  so dont use it for gaming.rest all social media, youtube, songs all it can run without any glitch.screen quality great much better than chinese counterparts.sansung UI is nice.camera good.loved slo mo and supar slo mo feature.
Cons: back of phone attracts finger prints.but u gonna put cover anyways.
Screen is not gorrila glass so temper glass is required.
Both cover and temper glass make it slightly fat also its mamooth battery.but still its not inconvenient.
Best phone in thi budget.but again this is review from a busy man not a pubg bug.

It's been 3 months since I have purchased this device and a brief review has been below:
Pros:
1)Battery life is awesome on this device and you can't complain about it
2)Camera is good but, could be better when compared to counterparts interms of lowlight photography and night mode...
3)Updates wise ok. Has got 3 Updates since purchase and none of them carried unnecessary bugs for goodness..

Cons:
1) The biggest con of this device is its fingerprint sensor that fails 9 out of 10 times on every attempt for me when my fingers are little bit dusty and sweaty

Heating issue is way high compared to other vivo oppo models in this price range. Display is the best picture quality is pretty good too.. oversaturation but it surely satisfies those love snapping a lot. If heating issues are resolved this is one heck of ccompetitor..humongous battery good display decent camera..no stutters felt.. though. UI runs smooth..no lags.

Writing this review after use of 1 week. Display is too good and vivid. Light weight and  sleek model through it has 6k MH battery. I've browsed apps average of 6 to 7 hours per day. Battery life last 2 days after it's fully charged.  Compare to other brands in the same price range, it has unique feature of blue light filter. Camera- Day light pictures are good but not great if compare with MI 7 pro. Need to improve more on night and live focus mode. Over all cool and affordable mobile. Not recommended  this if your choice is only for camera. Otherwise no doubt to buy M30s. Got mobile at 11.5k in great India festival season. Also wondered about delivery.  Ordered at 9PM and got mobile next day morning 6:30.  Thanks to Amazon for fastest delivery.

Starting with the battery life, it's just amazing. Just charge it once and it lasts the whole day with continuous internet surfing.
Fingerprint sensor works well, haven't faced any issues yet and also there is not much of a lag in unlocking.
Camera quality is awesome, wide angle images are just superb. Lots of features within the camera which lets you click fine quality images, also the best shot guidance makes it easier for you to identify the best spot.
Overall, I am happy with my purchase as I haven't faced any lags yet which means the processors work well.
In my suggestion, this is the best smartfone to go for within the budget range, as it has a lot to offer and with quality. The looks of the phone are also mesmerising.
A big thumbs up from my end.

1.Display is Super AMOLED, outdoor display brightness is better,
2. Ultra-wide camera is good
3. Battery is bigger enough
4. It does not have EIS,
5.Body is made of plastic which makes it quality inferior
6. Processor is power consuming
7. 15W fast charging is slow for this giant battery,
8. Small size apertures (48mp cam with an f/2.0 aperture, 5mp with an f/2.2 and 8mp with f/2.2.) capture less light through it. Result average night mode and less blurred bokeh,
9. Front cam selfie lack detailing and seems smoother and Super steady mode does not work on it,
10. NFC is no future technology and missing it in a latest phone does make it lack at some point

Amazon Making customer fool by selling this product . Camera Quality is not 48 megapixel. Even after my complaint they didn't reply correctly and denied to replace the item. I suggest customers if they want to try this phone must try but if you want to replace you must bhi replace by saying item is diffective aur any other problem and if there is no problem you must create that problem ,👎👎👎👎👎👎

The MONSTER smart phone and Samsung's one of the most featured phone, in below 15k,That's amazing. As expected performance wise it is optimistic and the battery life is awesome. I love this phone too much. It beat my expectations and standing at high according to me. Camera is  superb in natural light but need to be improved in low light conditions. Fingerprint is so good only when screen turned on, when in turned off condition it is taking some time but also good. Face ID is so fast in recognition
Very light in weight and colour is sapphire blue quite gorgeous. The Samsung apps missing are Samsung pass and Bixby
But google can substitute Samsung pass only Bixby  is missing. Except these the performance wise it is so boosted up and never stuck up. Always on display provided. Recommended for people who don't heavy games like pubg otherwise it is perfect

Screen resolutionv is very good. Excellent for watching movies. Audio is loud enough but lacks depth. Battery life is good, lasts one whole day of constant use. Phone doesn't get heated up. There is a clicking sound every time power button is pressed. Might be of a relay like switch. Quite annoying at times.
Device care feature is useful. Ultra memory saving is more trouble than help. Never unzip the apps using this feature.

Mobile look was good but I got the damaged product... Mobile was bend in the middle but unnoticable, you will come to know when u place your mobile on floor and when you hold mobile you can feel at sides that it is not fit and it gives you plastic sound when u press.
Camera is not up to mark... Not 48MP at all as per quality. Rest are ok

I returned and got new mobile again but still I see same issue.... I think samsung delivering damaged product or the product would have manufactured same.....

Return and replacement long time... No patience so just continued using now.

Amazing phone at the price. There might be other chinese phones available with better snapdragon processor at this price but samsungs display and quality of things used. Small things like sound quality haptic feedback trumps them . Camera is good. Amoled display is much better in samsung . The phone doesnt feel like ita packing a 6000mah battery . Battery life is amazing

Phone started playing up within a week of use.
First it started giving the error "SIM not registered on network" for my Airtel SIM card. Thinking it would be an issue with the SIM I replaced it with a new SIM. It worked okay for a few days and again started giving me the same error"SIM not registered on network". I'm still facing this issue on and off.
Secondly, since yesterday, it has also started giving me issues with screen lock. I can unlock the screen only with the finger touch. I don't get the option to input the unlocking pattern. I have to restart the phone every now and then to get a solution for this which is not done because every time I use the phone I first have to follow this procedure of unlocking the screen with finger touch and then restarting the phone.

It has been more then a month since i am using this phone.Overall the phone performance is good .It can handle daily task like charm.Multitasking and medium gaming is smooth no issues.I haven't played pubg though but games like hitman sniper and asphalt 9 runs smoothly.
Display of this phone is outstanding.Finger print reader was slow in starting but after recent update it has improved a bit.
But coming to camera part.After 2nd update given to this m30s Camera performance has gone down a bit.You can get to see noise while using camer BUT When you are using video mode there is hell lot of noise in it.I hope so samsung fix this.Overall the phone is good and its awesome.Battery life is outstanding.If you want a good battery life then you should definitely go for this.

Friends don't go with this mobile or Samsung smartphones...
Nowadays Samsung have not produced quality products ...
Even a months usage my sAMOLED display got damaged with normal usage not by accidentally dropped or mishandled...
In Service Centre they simply said that it happened by your mis handling or dropped and it won't be cover under warranty also...

Since 2013 using a Samsung smartphone without scratch card/back cover my old phone is still hav no problem even so many times dropped accidentally.

My suggestion is that don't buy Samsung phones on higher rate with same type of quality / service warranty please go with low priced phones like MI/VIVO/OPPO...

Display : Extraordinary beautiful as you expect from a Samsunguper Amoled display with vivid colours.
Battery : Since the battery is 6000Mah there isn'y any concern for heavy users as it can easily last for 2 days even with heavy usage.
Camera : Rear camera is pretty good with 48mp lens capturing some of the best shots and the Ultra Wide mode adds on to the beauty.I feel had the front camera been a little more strong it would have been a complete camera device.
Gaming: You can easily play all the games of your choice be it heavy or light,thanks to the game launcher which enhances the gaming experience preventing any sort of frame drops.
User Interface and OS : The device comes up with Android Pie with Android 10 to be expected soon.The OneUI is smooth and easy to use.
Processor : The Samsung Exynos 9611 is quite strong with no major complaints but it's not as strong as the Snapdragon 712 or 730.Xan compare it easily with Qualcomm Snapdragon 675.
Extra key features : Night mode making reading in the night much more comforting to your eyes.
Dolby Atmos which provides you a surround sound experience with an audio device connected.
Pop-up-View which makes it easier to view messages or notification in a single glance.
Always On display provides you continuous update of time and notification on the lock screen itself as the device doesn't have a notification light .
Thanks for reading 😀

I bought  the mobile mainly seeing Camera specs. Camera is up to the mark at this price range. Letting me take nice clicks in daily life.

Finger printer sensor  50-50
Display is really  cool one.
I am not a gamer. Still temple run runs smoothly, I know, no one plays it these days.
Battery life  just ok. Charger  also not too fast.

Verdict really cool budget phone.

This is the best phone at this price. As they mentioned #GoMonster it deserves it. It long lasts the battery. With my previous phone I used to charge phone twice a day but now with this I am charging once in 2 days. About camera - It is an average camera but in day light it gives it's best result. You can be satisfy with this phone and speed is the usual as every phone which has 4GB RAM. Finally, A great one which does justice to given specs.

I have being using this mobile for the last one month bought 6GB/128GB variant. So far I have not faced any problems. Look and feel is awesome. The amoled display and battery are the highlights. I would say this a worth buying to this budget.
Pros
Fullscreen tear drop display.
Screen size is big enough to handle and not too large which make it difficult to handle/carry
Long battery life, fast charge which may heat up the phone. otherwise normal charging option is also available.
Camera quality is good, impressive front camera and good selfi pictures
Cons
Fingerprint sensor is not too sensitive and slightly delay
Auto rotate mode also has delay in response

Fingerprint reader are all time response r not too good.
Camera quality best.but night  mood are not improve . I wish Selfie quality better than next time. It's just ok.
6000mAh battery install plan are nice.but 6000mAh battery work not to be good.other companies 4000mAh battery and samsung 6000mAh battery same work.could be better optimized. Please update great battery optimization on next updating.

13999 price segment Samsung M30s are too good choice and mindblowing mobile.but make a small improvement. Optimization are must to be on battery(update could be slove this).
Nice and Fabulous  Mobile.Thank you Samsung

This is one of the best mobile phones ever seen and used I liked it a lot . It has a very reasonable rate and it has many facilities with it also . It is very user friendly and I liked its camera a lot also , the pictures that they take are really awesome . I also liked its screen resolution . I really liked the color of the phone (SAPPHIRE BLUE) which has both sapphire and also blue shades at the same time . The flashlight is also really awesome. It also has many new modes compared to my old phone like the Dolby atmos mode , the blue light filter, the smart view mode and the night mode which are really useful . I also liked the battery life which lasts long and it also comes with a fast charger which is very useful . It has face recognition and also a fingerprint sensor which are really useful for security . Overall I would like to call it "THE BUDGET PHONE"

After using the m30s for 6 months, I've decided to modify my review. After switching from an A series to the M, it seems quite a downgrade with this phone. The keyboard is a pain. It's as if it's got a brain of itself. The space bar needs 2 taps mostly for a single space. Not sure if it's the touch panel or just a software glitch. Have kept myself up to date to the OS patches. Other than that, it's an OK phone. Good battery backup!
Needs improvement in camera a bit.

Such a beautiful product don't know why people giving negative feedback about camera clarity..with this price  Samsung has given best  almost good quality..trust me camera clarity is good but you need to set proper mode and settings.
No words about battery  observed for 3 to 4 days massive battery back up of 6000 mah in this budget plz don't think if u r bugestis bellow 14 k please go ahead with Samsung M30s... I would recommend this.

I boughr this phone in October
It worked well till last month. From then it started giving problems. I donot understand what happened to the phone. Suddenly it all started. If I slide the screen it started flickering. Ans slowly lost the complete dis play. I am using the phone very carefully. It did not fall either. Today in The morning suddenly the screen started flickering and the touch stopped working and now the display stopped working completely.
My recommendation is pls be very care ful in buying this phone. Initially it may work properly. But within few months problems may start.think twice befor you buy this phone.

I am using it from last 3 days and I can say that this is the best mobile in terms of battery backup, camera and performance at this price range. Mobile looks like a premium phone. Design is very beautiful.
I was very upset with Amazon delivery when I booked it on last sale, since I haven't received my phone even after 10 days and committed delivery dates. So I cancelled my phone. Later I decided to give one more try for especially this phone again and this sale Amazon makes me happy by delivering in a days time.

Thank you Samsung and Amazon for this product and service.

Amoled display-10/10
6000mah battery-10/10
Samsung exynos 9611-10/10
Pubg , cod mobile etc run smoothly on this device at high graphics settings without any lag or heating issue. The 6000 mah battery allows you to play straight for at least 4-5 hrs without charging. The fingerprint reader however is fast but not as fast as other devices out there such as OnePlus and iPhone but gets the job done in 1-2 extra milliseconds. Overall it's a great phone with a light weight ratio and doesn't feel heavy in the hand at all. The output from streaming services such as Amazon prime and Netflix turns out to be great because of the amoled display. Samsung's night mode allows you to extend your battery life by 2-3 hrs and also looks soothing to the human eye. Overall it's a great buy under 20,000 with the 9611 exynos which is equivalent to Snapdragon 725.

Awesome 👏🏻 , I got one for my mom , I just loved it . I purchased another in 3 days again for my self . I am using iPhone 7 ( 126GB, 68k in 2016 ) , this phone has better  screen, battery 🔋 life , bigger ram than my phone. I wanted to have one Android phone , so I ordered immediately again for my self ,camera is giving very satisfying results. Fingerprint reader is quick. In last two days I used only 58% battery ( watching YouTube almost most of the time)

The product Samsung M30S is all with the said configuration and presently performing well.  No overheating noted during charging.  Sufficient Battery that is 6000mAH and fast charging.  Display and camera very good.  I did not install any app on it so the speed , performance etc .. .later after a month use i will give detail review.
  I give rating 4.5 for this because samsung did not provide ear phone with the set, which is very much required alongwith the set.  I purchased the ear phone  separately from outside market. you have to buy protecter glass and mobile coverfrom market which is a additional expenditure to  you.
  Another draw back you can not connect this phone to usb  pendrive since samsung changed its universal port to a bigger one (ie. you cannot connect with to OTG cable).
UPDATE AFTER TWO MONTHS USE :
OVER HEAT ISSUE OBSERVED.

Fingerprint reader lags sometime...
Not bad category camera.. front camera's autobrightnes function sucks.. it affects on camera quality..
best in class battery life.. but the takes much longer time because they gave a 15w charger beside of 18w.. supports 18w charger..
display quality good because it's super amoled display..
Samsung does not gave earphones.. it must be choosen for cost cutting..
Dolby Atmos gives best sound output.. processer is good..
played 3 hrs pubg daily fr processor review..sometimes it's heated a lot... Battery backup is marvelous.. minor lags..
Back panel got some scratches..Keep it protected with rubber back cover..
Display is just protected with just Gorilla glass 3..

Overall good for normal use.. if priority is camera then look for redmi..

Samsung M30s comes with super Amoled display of 6.4inches and the quality of display is up to the mark like superb and now Let me tell you about the main highlight of this phone is battery life the 6000mah battery gives you the perfect time to spent with your phone even if you play heavy games on the phone like pubg and aspault9 the battery  does not  drain out fastly and now come to the camera the triple rear camera setup gives you the perfect shot wether it is wide angle shot or ultra wide angle the quality of photos &amp; videos are good .
And the processor exnos gives you perfect gaming experience you can play heavy games on it it also have a game booster for your games and fingerprint reader works good and as well as face id also performing better overall at this price point samsung giving you lots of features and this is a best budget phone.

According to price and high quality battery backup i.e.6000 mah in comparison to the other mobile, it is the best. Samsung has launched an awesome, fantastic, and mind blowing product M30S mobile. It is having everything which I was looking for in my new mobile. It is very nice phone for day – to –day life. Bright Display is awesome.

To start with, the best part of this phone is it's battery which is quite huge in terms of power and lightweight and lasts long. Second thing which i likes is it's design and appearance an out of the edge look. I have used it for 2 months got yo know lots of tricks and lot of amazing features. The camera is just mesmerizing and you can't stop clicking pictures. There's no problem in network everything works fast and smoothly best phone available in this price segment. Go for it!! Without a doubt best phone by Samsung

Smarty designed and smartly priced by Samsung. On top of it, Amazon makes it a better buying experience by offering discounts, buyback and cashback. Phone is sleek, stylish and looks good in hand. 6000mah battery is hard to drain in a day. Screen gives slight look of curved edges on both sides although it isn't. My 6gb-128gb variant cost 11,100 after buyback, card discount and cashback in Amazon pay. You cannot get same spec phone at this price from another brand at the moment.

A full review of mobile
1)Yes, it's have a monster battry of 6000MH it will take approx 150 minutes for full charge,according to my opinion if u full charged once no need to charge again in whole day after a exhausting use
2) in display fingerprint reader not available &amp; available on back side but working well..face distinction working very well..
3) camera just clicking natural photos not beautifying photo using AI technology..yappi wide angle camera is awesome  u can capture 200% times then normal photo..
4) gaming performance is good u can play game like pubg on ultra high resolution.
Lokks normal but classy
Display is awesome as always provide by Samsung always..
All over it a best mobile provide by Samsung on the price range..

The battery life is good, it can be used for two days and still have some percentage charge left.
The fast charger charges the phone in 2hrs
The finger print scanner is fast but the back gets scratched easily
Phone is not slippery and quite light to hold
Camera quality is good in daylight, and detailing in not always good
The phone runs on one UI , which is quite nice to work with.
I have used it for a week, I have tested out most of the gestures and some of the developer options as well, some are new.
The phone hasn't hanged in the time that I have used it.
The phone manages split window as well as popup well.

Samsung still needs to work hard on their selfie camera,rest the phone is a beast with such an
 aggressive  price. Battery outperforms  all other phones that makes this smartphones even more smarter. Display looks beautiful . Overall a very smart buy. After using it for 2 weeks I feel the 4gb ram gets used up very easily and all we are left with is 800-600 mb ram while few apps are running in background and this is when I am having regular apps Without having any game installed in my phone. I wish I could have opted for 6gb variant instead Because 4gb is not enough even with regular apps.

This product is best for this price range
Camera clarity is very good
I got 2 day battery backup
Amoled Display was awesome..no finger marks on the screen while using
back camera color sensitivity is little bit low as compared to Mi phones and also after taking a photo it takes a while for previewing that image
build quality is good
Phone's speaker performance as not much better sound experience
Samsung does not provide a headset with this phone

All the features are the best in this price.
The battery and the screen quality is awesome.
However the front camera and the live focus have scope of improvements but still the camera is good and the stabilization during recording a video is very nice.
It can also rec videos at 30 frames per second which is more than normal of 24fps.
So overall it's the best in the price range and can even beat lots of phones within 20k.

I booked another mobile for my friend because:

I like the one UI. I think user interface having great importance. Very good UI, setting having search option, changing data sim is very easy and others convenient features.

Battery is best amongst all contemprory mobiles.

Camara quality is good having convenient features to control and useful options
Good wide angle photography.
Stability is very good during video recording.

Samsung default apps like gallary, calander, calculator, samsung notes, my files- these are day to day usable apps are excelent. These are ads free and not best amongst all manufacturor.

Display is excelent.

I compermises on notification light and infrared features due to above merits.

Above review is based on one week use.

Its a great phone at this price after discounts .
Fingerprint scanner is very fast , performance of the phone is gr8, i m a heavy user and i dont see any lag in the ui ,ui is feature rich and fast.pubg runs smooth on high and hd setting even on hd and ultra performance is good. Dont play on uhd .i m having 6gb variant ram mgmt. Is good . Battery life is excellent and display also is great . Sound quality is good. At full volume it gets decently loud.
Some minor CONS in my opinion
1.It Dont come with one ui full version hence dox,edge lighting not come as u got on a50s .

2. Good lock app is not supported or running even i tried every tutorial on youtube . May be because of different ui one ui core.

3. Camera can be improved . Picture quality is below avg.
Its a great value for money smartphone.

Battery life is higher as compared to 4000 mah phones. I would watch videos for an entire day.
Camera quality is excellent with various videos and photo modes that are effective and enhance the overall quality.
Fingerprint reader does the job, though I do not need it much due to face detection  feature which is very effective in day as well as in dark.
All in all a nice and feature packed phone with majority of user interested features being of excellent quality , at this price point is a win win situation. Not to forget the large display an sAMOLED screen is just an icing on cake, which rules out others out of its competition.
Happy buying !!!

It is the best phone in this range...
Love the camera quality.. Night mode is very good.. Clean picture. Not much noise in night mode.. 48mp what else you want in this price... It's like a pocket bomb comes in the box. I brought this phone to my father as he always poking me about his phones battery life and camera quality... Now after giving him Samsung M30s, I never him as happy as before.
6000mAh battery, Triple camera.... It also have wide angle camera. Now I am become greedy to buy that phone too...
Fingerprint is really quick.. Face recognition is very fast and good.
Samsung always gives the bright Amoled displays which is vibrant and showing the actual picture which our eyes see...
Over all great phone.. I buy it on the day its launched.. And I am happy with my decision..
Go buy it guys... It's a great fon

display - best feature of the phone.
camera - at least f/1.8 aperture could have been nice
battery - say no more
as the adaptive brightness uses camera sensor, it drains some battery
processor - so far, good
fingerprint reader - not the fastest I've seen
build quality - you get what you pay for, it's fine. bezels look clean.
got it for 12,600₹ and this phone is perfect for an average user.

This is one of the best from Samsung. Thanks for making this product and launching it at this price. Mostly lived up to my expectations. Whether it's the performance or sensors or camera or display or the battery everything is provided in a justified manner.  My only expectation was that it had a full fledged Samsung Pay support which works on NFC. Secondly a case in the box. Only these two are  not present

The amoled screen is good, battery life is good (2 days use with full time internet connection ON) -

but internet connectivity is 3rd class quality, I have put on flight mode and then back to access internet ( *This was not the case in my previous Asus laser2 under same usage condition- ever ready with stable connection* ).

Better buy mi phones ( Now 8 series, you can get better products below this price range).

If I would had 30 days replacement, then surely would have did it.

Please don't update your any xyz phones after 2 months of purchase- a common tip for all mobile users, as manufacturers tend to lower your phones performance for selling out their new products in market.

Pros :
Back camera is as good as it gets
Battery is good it last 1.75 days on a medium to heavy usage.
Overall performance is great(p.s I ain't a gamer).
Best videos viewing experience in the price range .
Very good sound quality.

Cons :
Camera transition is slow
Finger Touch is also on a little bit slower side
Front camera could have been better .
Little bit heavy due to massive size.

Overall I am satisfied with the device considering the price paid ..strongly suggested for normal users..

Since last 3 days I am using my new phone Samsung M30s and really surprised to see the performance, I was excited to have such an device within super low price, I found this device really monster in everything whether it is battery backup whether it is camera and display everything is excellent.
Pictures clicked with mobile with 48 megapixel settings are excellent and display is also top in class and the great deal I have received from Amazon having 10 % discount on card and 1000 rupees cashback, 1 year screen replacement is also adding more satisfaction to the buyers,
overall excellent device at excellent prize and excellent brand value to all the buyers.

Signal reception is poor . I am getting 2 to 3 bars of idea 3g signal inside my room on all my older devices ( redmi y1 , xiomi A2 , redmi note 4 , redmi note 5 pro and poco f1 , but in the same room Samsung m30s is struggling for network . Contacted Amazon for the same , so that it can be replaced with some other brand . But Amazon replied it is against their policy , neither it will be refunded nor it will be changed with some other brand . Amazon technical team told me since it is a 4g handset and my idea sim is also 4g , so it cannot access 3g signals 😂 and indirectly advised me to change my service provider (idea). With no option left I am using it with my bsnl WiFi . Please read Amazon returns and refunds policies before buying any mobile , I didn't , so it's my mistake in the end .Is there any other option left with me kindly suggest .

After using it for around 15 days I'm writing this review.
Overall the product is good. Majorly I found 3 issues in it.

1. Battery drains quickly as compared to other phones in this same price even which have smaller batteries than this (like 4000 or 5000mah)
2. Camera do not capture sharp images. Instead of focusing on installing 3 camera it would be better if companies focus more on image processing algorithm.
3. It has the network issues which is a serious issue. Using same network in same area if you are getting 1mbps of speed than in this you will only get 600-700kbps.

The 3 above problems can be resolved by providing software updates if company desires and problem can be resolved.
Otherwise the phone it's good. Fingerprint,  screen, no legging or heating issue.

The phone has spectacular battery life. Two days with average use, a day with heavy use (gaming, streaming etc.)

The processor is average. Not as good as its Snapdragon counterpart but is able to handle light games, streaming just fine. Multitasking gets a bit laggy at times.

The camera is good enough. I firmly believe that it's the photographer and the subject that matter more than the camera. It's not a DSLR but will do just fine for amateur photography.

Samsung is going to try and scam you into seeing ads during the entirety of the setup process. Uncheck every box that you can. If you disable the correct apps you aren't going to get any ads so at least this is better than the Xiaomi experience.

One UI and the gesture controls make for a snappy user experience.

All-in-all a good phone for the price.

Let's come direct to the point.......
Pro's
1. A big massive battery lasts easily 2 days
2. Super amoled screen
3. Performance
Cons
1. Plastic build
2. Doesn't have a gorilla glass
3. Some times for a minute or two the phone gets slightly heated on the upper part when you download any file .
I think these 3 pro's and cons will help you ....just go and grab in price segment 13k

Samsung Galaxy M30S needs a software update.

Pros:1:  Good battery but not great battery
Pros:2: Good speakers and reception quality

Cons: 1. Screen contrast needs to be manually adjusted. Auto mode is not so effective
Cons: 2. After using it for more than 15days, a slight lag is seen. Seems like the processor speed is not too good. However, may not affect most of the users.
Cons: 3. Fingerprint lock is not available. Every time you need to press the power button.
Cons: 4. Takes time to store 3:4 ratio 48 MP photos
Cons: 5: No Gorilla Glass screen. May break easily after falling on the face.
Cons: 6: Plastic body whereas most phones have metal bodies these days.

I bought this mobile its a good product for the price
This review is according to my perspective
Camera: 48mp primary lense, the quality is low when compare to a70 of 32mp
Wide angle is great, depth of field is awesome, front camera is not too bad..

Batterylife: 2days used in fully charge,(youtube, social media, and others browsing)..its good

Screen: its great, i had a friends using oppo,when compare to samsung, mine is far better, the display, clearity, sensitivity.

Delivery: 2days, abit decourage...

No damage or tampered..
Thanks amazon and samsung.

A value for money product, screen quality is top class, only problem is charging time.

It takes around 2.5 hours to charge the battery completely with the 15w charger provided by Samsung. I dont know if 18w charger is supported but its surely not fast charging. So if you are used to with dash charging or VOOC flash charging, you will surely feel the difference.

Apart from the charging time issue, this phone will rarely give you reasons to complain. Good job Samsung.

Get this phone in 11,200 rs. in discount last month &amp; in this range
Battery back up is superb (I have tried by keeping off mobile data when not needed for max. battery back up check &amp; I have found it runs 2.5 to 3 full days after fully charged once)... For the average users, it will last up to 1.5/2 days &amp; for hardcore gamers even it will last up to 24 hours for sure...
Performance vice also great... Camera results are also good (expect low light)...
Value for Money = 10/10...
Overall = 9/10...

After using it for a week.. as per my purchased mobile the review is as follows:

Battery - lasts for an average of 9:00hrs while using internet and watching youtube/netflix videos all day long..guess I expected more

Camera - the back cam is fantastic and the front cam is how you'd expect an actual 16mp cam would be like

Fingerprint reader - sad to say that it is slower than  the previous phone I had which is honor 9i

Display - As the crowd says..amoled display from Samsung rocks with a full hd display

Processor - heats up a bit while gaming continuously after an hour..didn't find any other fault other than that with any other functionalities

Hope I covered the basics..might update more after I get to know more about the phone.

Samsung totally control this phone like u cannot use other keyboard it does not work well. Your contacts are saved in Samsung account. So android users should not buy this phone. Samsung Galaxy has it's own apps which ride over Google apps, therefore phone interface was not easy. Battery and camera are good but not extraordinary hence not value for money. Nothing exclusive feature found in this phone yet spend RS.17000, even shortcuts are not easy to operate neither user friendly. ANDROID ONE phones are much better and easy to handle. Seriously waste of money

It is a treat to finally have a phone which is value for money from the house of Samsung. I have used this phone for 5 days as my primary and want to share the following Postive points.

1.Excellent set of cameras, 48 megapixel mode is great but the normal 12 mp mode is great too. The wide angle lens is the widest available in the market at this price point.
2.Battery life is exemplary, with moderate usage, a full charge lasts close to 2 days.
3.Processor speed is excellent but not the best in class though. Yet in day to day usage one wouldn't find any problems.
4.Type C port and a 15 watt fast charger provided in the box is a huge plus.
5.Has a triple slot solution allowing for a dedicated micro sd slot with 2 sim slots.
6.The display is to die for. Gorgeous, that is the only word for it, Samsung SUPER AMOLED FHD+.

I loved the product.The performance ,camera quality ,everything !But I dont know why when I downloaded a game and it wanted to download extra content,whenever i scroll down from the up,and look how much the game downloaded content ,it lagged very badly(the above 2 lines for the developers.)For those who want a mobile in budget.this is the perfect one.It have almost have everything the costly mobiles have.Press the buy now button if you want a new mobile in budget.

If you want a mobile for gaming this is not the right one. Although gaming is possible, you wouldn't get the butter smooth gaming experience on this device. Apart from that it's an outstanding smartphone for daily use. It's battery has no rival in this price segment. All in all, it's an ideal smartphone for those who are on a budget. And no one can give you better display than samsung in this price range. And samsung is providing Super Amoled Display with this device. This is the most value for money smartphone in this price range.

Apart from the cameras, which are not the best in the segment, the rest of the package is almost unbeatable. The standout feature is, of course, the battery back-up. With normal usage, you don't need to charge the phone for two days. The phone is big and yet not too heavy, thanks to clever packaging. The screen is brilliant, that's something you'd expect from a SuperAMOLED panel. If you are on a budget of about 15K, the M30s is a must-consider.

Amazing sensing...
Money worth product....
Camera tooooooooo good..
Awesome battery life...
Fast fingerprint reading sensors
Face unlock....
It's beautiful back colour through which I couldn't resist to purchase it..
Best part is that you are always with your personal Google Assistant... Loved it 😍..
I don't think there is any lacking in it...
Has many new features that are impressive..
One of them is the Bokeh mode...  Literally it's amazing...
And even I have suggested it to all everyone...
And all the features mentioned...  Are truly fulfilled....

Since it's Samsung so it's reliable...
Just on my first view I ordered it as even earlier also I was using one of the amazing Samsung Mobile J2 (2016) which has the smart glow....

Samsung Galaxy M30S in Rs 14000 is good but not best.
It does not has good camera. And lacks essential Galaxy features like Bixby, secure folder and other.
And neither it has gorilla glass protection which is a serious drawback.
Overall the phone is good and camera is also good.

Don't come in trap of no cost EMI it's fraud. You will have to pay interest more than shown on the checkout time.

Awesome handset in this price segmant and also i got it on discount from amazon
The battery performance is superb with 6000 mah and fast charging . i will rate it 10/10.

Camera is 9.5/10 . The best feautre you will get is wide angle mode which is pretty cool. And live focus is also very good and clear edge defection.

SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY -- 10/10. You can watch movies in full hd resolution with awesome quality.

Sound is also good.
In looks this mobile will give you premium feel.

Why you should buy it?
Big battery, Good camera, premium looks and big and awesome display Super-Amoled screen, U notch display.
Everything in Single pack. And you will get a Brand SAMSUNG .

No product is totally perfect, Asus ROG 2 is a perfect all rounder but the price is not perfect for common man :-D. Hence samsung M30S is awesome phone with good build, good ui, great battery, great service post purchase. It's meant for PPL who browse a lot, songs, movies, online streaming, lots of calls, data usage, and everything else except high gaming and good quality pictures as compared to realme XT and redmi 8 pro.

If gaming and camera quality is not your need means it's a prefect phone. I bought it for my parents and they are happy with all day twitter, fb and whatsapp.

Overall  a great mobile.
Display  awesome.
Smooth  performance. User interface is easy to learn if switching from other brands. Backup of data from cloud was a snap.
Fingerprint sensor is v fast.
Easy One handed  operation
Bloatware could have been avoided.
Few snaps taken came out well.
Battery life ...  calls, wifi, mobile data, video calling,  music...battery  lasted more than 1.5 days and  still some juice left (no gaming).

Had issues with making  a call after not using the phone for an hour or two. Calls wouldn't go through (basic need), had to reboot to make it work. Could be  a bug but didn't expect this. Hence  4 stars overall.

Fully satisfied with camera. Camera interface and overall performance is not that fluid. Fingerprint reader does the job. Battery lasts a day easily but don't expect extraordinary considering 6000 mah. Also, the charger takes 2-3 hours for full battery.

The phone is a very good deal at the price point and add to it the bank offers/cash back on amazon makes it irrestible. Display is good, dedicated memory slot, widevine L1 and a 6000 mah battery makes it the phone to buy this festive season. And samsung has also worked on the packaging and the quality of materials used [as comapred to the M30]. Awesome Samsung, seems you are back in the game after long and the customer service/delivery of amazon makes me think there is a reason why amazon is the most valued company in the world. Thanks and keep up the good work amazon and samsung

Battery life is outstanding
Display is awesome
If you are looking for a smartphone to watch movies and listening to music go for it...Because it has approximately 2 days battery life in a single charge and videos can be experienced with sAMOLED display
If you are looking for a best camera phone try other options also
(Its super slowmotion,slow motion,hyperlapse camera modes are good and its ultrawide mode is also good. Selfies are also good)NOTE:THEY ARE GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST

It's a budget friendly buy. So far, I'm very satisfied with the mobile. It's little more weight compared to other phones. But all the while, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the battery life. I use my phone extensively. Even by end of the day I still have nearly 50% of the battery. So those looking for a good battery life, I think it's one of the best available. The camera too is real good.

I bought this phone for my mother. The brand new phone is getting heated so easily, it has become impossible to hold. Unfortunately, by the time I reached my home and set up phone the return window was already over. This sums up my experience with online shopping. It just doesn't seem to fit well.

This review is after using the mobile for almost a month:
Pros: camera quality.
Smooth touch.
Processing speed between the applications

Cons:
As boasted with 6000mah battery is not worth, 100% charging is drained to 10% in 6 hrs. [I have tried to stop all background running apps, I had Bluetooth and mobile data completely turned on for 24hrs]

During calls the ear piece gets heated up in 3-7 min, which is irritating

During phone is under charged the phone gets heated, got to know this when I take off the phone from charging

Finger print reader sometimes gets lagged and I had to switch off and turn on the phone to recognize me.

Verdict:
Good budget phone but radiation from this phone is high.

Good -

Buttery- Amazing
Fast charging - Astonishing
Processor- super fast
Display- Amazing when blue light filter is on
Face lock and biometric are also working super fast

Bad-

I am not happy with camera quality as i expected, it's camera quality looks like 13mp

I got it in 11,600

1400 Sbi discount and 1000 Amazon balance

Overall amazing product at this price.

Robust features, high-resolution triple camera, 6000 amp battery, 64 Gb storage. face recognition and fingerprint sensor make it the best mobile in town, of course with the exchange offer and Amazon's celebration made its true value for money to me.
Pros
48 mp triple camera-amazong depth and clarity
64 gb storage plenty of apps, music and video
4 gb ram fast processing
gorilla glass safety
6000 Uah battery- durable for long
fast charging in extra quick time
Fingerprint sensor

cons
no earphones in the pack (just buy one that you like)

The phone was heavily hyped when it came in. And being a 'Samsung' phone, you expect a rather better quality phone. The UI is a bit laggy specially while switching between apps or unlocking phone. The fingerprint reader and the face unlock are okay, not very good or very bad. However, the battery life is above par but it worsens with time, in the start it stays almost 1.75 days but now 1.25 to 1.5 days. The camera quality is disappointing, especially low light photography is bad.  Still a good enough phone for the price in discount. The Android 10 update is also no where to be seen maybe until even April 2020. That is bad.

I recently purchased this device and when i held it in my hand i was like nuts, man how a phone with such a massive battery can be as lightweight as this?
The phone having packed up with latest Exynos 9611 processor just adds up an extra mile of smoothness to the gaming on it. The image quality from the triple camera setup as well the selfie camera was remarkable indeed .The fingerprint sensor works just fine adding extra security to the device. The face unlock is quite fast as well. The sAMOLED display is very vibrant. With the fast charging support with latest USB type C port charging a phone with such a big battery doesn't feel like a mess.
After my phone had arrived I saw many of my friends ordering this device in a flash. Overall build quality of the phone is amazing
Overall rating 4.7/5 Very happy with it😊😊😊

This is one heck of a phone in this price range. You will feel this as soon as you hold this in our hand. Touch quality is very good. No heating  problem even after hrs of gaming. Processing is fast considering  its exynos. Camera could have been better considering  48 mp. You might feel this sometime. If you r buying this for photography  U might be disappointed  but if U r buying it for normal uses one of the best deals U can get in this range.
A gud to buy option

Positives: SAmoled  Screen,  Touch Resoponse, Battery
Overall Performance is gud.
Negatives: Images pixelate when zooming In, sometimes distortion issue in ultra wide mode.

Samsung Galaxy M30s is full package deal for anyone looking for budget phone with good battery life.

This phone has amazing battery life. I had kept the phone for charge for a couple hour and I was able to use this with data, location services turned on without battery saving mode for nearly 2 complete days without a need for charge.

However, I found that this phone dries out battery in last stages quickly when it reaches 15 percent or lower. Also, when you create a hotspot the battery loses charge a bit quickly than other tasks.

All in all a great phone with great battery life, amazing Samsung UI features and one of the best camera in this price segment.

Go for it without second thoughts!

Resolution is very good, battery is very good, 2 days battery. Stand by more than 2 days. Fingerprint senser is fast, but when click a photo by rear camera with 48mp mode, it takes 3 to 4 second to save the image, which is not good. Super steady mode is not availbe in it, then why mentioned that it has. Night mode is superb. It does not have samsung knox security. No gorrila glass.

Even if we speak / use Whatsapp / Youtube for JUST 10 mins, mobile is becoming suddenly hot / warm on the upper portion of the screen (may be due to processor overload / any SAMSUNG Processor issue ??, not sure) - I think one of the MAJOR Issues that SAMSUNG has not solved yet (as some previous models also got blasted / was having hanging issues). Expecting at least let this issue may get resolve in future SAMSUNG mobiles (which has this type of processor).

Apart from this Big issue, from last one week I have not observed any other issues and everything is better as of now and other features, Camera, Battery seems okay for me.

I like the battery back up compared to my earlier phone, what I dislike is the phone going into kind of flight mode on non usage for a long time especially during night. The phone and data signals automatically go off and I am forced to either restart or put the phone into flight mode and then on it. I don't know whether it is software problem or what exactly it is. Phone lags a bit in performance and it is sluggish when playing a graphic intensive game even though my phone has 6GB RAM. Otherwise phone is good, I have given 3 star rating.

Initially I thought 6000 mAh battery, 6GB RAM, 48 MP Camera!!!! JUST WOW!!!... But I feel sorry. Battery backup not really very good. It is not like 6000 mAh at all. It would not last even single day. Camera definitely not matching 48 MP quality. Not upto to the mark at any specification. Please don't buy. Go for other option. SORRY SAMSUNG YOU DISAPPOINTED ME.

I recently  brought  Samsung  M30s from Amazon.  The phone is amazing.  The battery backup is great as I could use it without recharging  for more than 1.5 days. The camera has some really good options like wide angle and pro. The screen touch is very sensitive, smooth nd equal to none! The fingerprint sensor is very quick. In this range, with brand as good as samsung, I doubt  there is any other challenger to the Monster! My recommendation,  given the current offer, just go for it!

I have been using it for close to two months now.

Pros
UI is very good
Most of the pre-loaded apps are uninstallable. Hence it's largely junk-free.
Battery life is awesome. With full-fledged usage, it lasts for two full days. Great for people who travel a lot.
Camera is good

Cons
The charging cable doesn't fit properly in the slot. It needs to be inserted multiple times for charging.

Overall a great phone to buy in this budget.

This product is definitely very good in this product range. The main highlight is its 6000 mAh battery and believe me it gives me the screen time of 12 hours ( I don't play games). The camera quality is good, especially the rear camera takes great photos in daylight. It also performs well in low light conditions with Night mode enabled. The front camera is average and struggles in low lighting conditions. The fingerprint reader and face unlock works pretty well and unlocks the device without any issue. The one-UI is very cool and gives you a lot of options to customize your phone. Overall, I have a pretty good experience with the device and will recommend it to people who are willing to buy a phone in 15k range. And yeah, I forgot one thing, the screen is awesome and gives you a great visual experience.

I am using this phone (6GB+128 GB) from past 1 week and below is my observations.

1. Battery is really monster. Best battery phone till now.
2. Performance wise this phone is good as compare to other competitors.
3. Camera is good in day light(outside) but its below average if you will click photos in normal light. Night light photography is very very bad. I was expecting better camera.
4. Look wise phone is very good specially its black color.
5. Sound is average like other phones.
6. Little slippery but you can order back cover to avoid this.
7. Full charge will take 90 minutes even if its having fast charging support.

This is really a good option in this price range.

If there was negative star rating, I would have given 5 negative stars for camera quality with having 48 mega pixels.

There is two main features of this Samsung M30s: 48 maga pixel rear camera and 6000 mah battery. But, unfortunately rear camera quality is not upto the mark.

Amazon and Samsung have tied up together to sell this worst phone.

Further, Amazon has refused me to replace/return/refund this product saying that for camera quality we have no return policy.
I would suggest don't buy this mobile, especially from Amazon.

Flipkart has better return/replace/refund policy.

It doesn’t have earphones. Really disappointed. It’s charger won’t work with old samsung phones. So if you are taking phone so that you can have an extra pair of earphones or charger, don’t take it. For my other samsung phone I had to buy a new charger. This is the reason more people prefer Iphones. Otherwise phone is nice

Over seven days of moderate usage. Battery backup was really good. Network reception was average. Redmi provides a little better network reception with same operator. Camera default settings aren’t set to the fullest resolution. Sensor is good but image processing isn’t the best. Especially considering Samsung is known for its image quality. In this section, Oppo and Vivo have taken the lead.
Phone has all the required sensors and a 3.5mm headphone jack with USB Type C fast charging.
Performance was satisfactory.
Average plastic build; not a very premium feel in the hands but good looks and sleek design.

Hi,
Its been a good experience since last 7 days I bought this phone. Earlier I used Redmi note 5 pro but then changed to this. One compititor Poco f1 includes some good features than samsung but with overall performance Samsung m30s I think is better than any other phone at same cost. Its look good to carry this phone and I am not using any back cover yet and it looks and also feel good as it is. I also have left playing PUBG and I am not a user who require high performing CPU . To use it for your daily apps I don't think there could be any other option at such price. Also FYI I am using opal black variant of this phone and it looks far more stylish than Poco and yes Amoled screen it is too good to get such option at such cost.
Samsung may become part of this revoltion in phone industry.

In my family five mobile is there approx all leading companies. But i thing m30s is best among all ,one of the key feature its two days full battery perfomance and its multitasking is so fast because of 2.3 cpu speed and 6gb ram. Its display is very elegant and  smooth.Pearl white colour look likes very costly mobile whenever my friends seen mine mobile they ask yeah which one it is .camera quality of samsung mobile is always best.Value for money.
One more thing i mentioned here is amazon service within 24 hours deliver the product early in the morning 9 o clock hatsoff👌 for that ,really feels like 'apni dukaan'. I get immediate one thousand cash back.

I can't believe how amazing this product is for such a good price. I bought it on the 28th of Sept as a prime member deal and received it the net day! writing this review after 1 week of heavy use.  The battery is amazing as promised in the advertisements. also the triple rear camera is doing an excellent job. Sound quality and display are awesome and I love the sapphire blue color as it can make you stand out different from other phones. The product is highly recommended for if you are looking to change your phone under the price of 20000. I also bought M10s as it was a steal for me on Amazon great indian festival sale. Definetly a Good to go product,.

I have purchased Pearl white color, 6 GB variant. Phone is some what okay not recommended to gamer/Heavy users. Phone display is real good but phone quality is not worth the price. Phone back panel is made of plastic which feels like it is made of cheap quality. front glass is not gorilla glass i guess because they didn't mentioned which type of glass is used in this phone. Camera quality is average, picture quality &amp; color is realistic thanks for Samsung. i highly recommend if you buy this phone kindly purchase screen guard because there is high chance of getting scratches.

It is a terrific mobile, the display, camera and battery is awesome,
The user interface is the best.
It hardly hangs, and it has a small bug sometimes the notification doesn't disappear from taskbar despite clearing it, which is a bit annoying.

The mobile is too big, not handy, difficult to use from single hand, and doesn't fit in most of the pocket.

It has many privacy concerns, one of them is the facebook app is preinstalled, it cannot be uninstalled which actually steals your data even if you don't use facebook. Samsung has to take care of privacy concern and protect its user's data.

Great phone for the sub 20k segment. Such a massive battery, lasts really long. The screen is awesome. Although, given the weight of the device, it doesn't make you feel that there is such a massive battery packed inside it. The colours are so vivid. Sound quality in speaker as well as in ear piece is amazing. Fell in love with One UI. Such a smooth experience it is to use it! It is packed with uncountable and some mind blowing features. Apart from the experience of using the device, I love how it feels just holding the device. I has such a premium feel.

I am using Samsung mobile for the 1st time. Earlier i use to MI phones. I am writing this review after using this mobile for some days now.

Pros: 1 good quality AMLOED display 2 good battery life 3. Some good features like smart view, smart pop up, Dolby sound and much more
4 light weight product

Cons:
1. Camera quality is very poor in low light. It's good only when light on the subject is good. I am disappointed with this that's why gave 4 ratings.
2 face reading screen unlock fails to work most of the times in the low light.

FOR LTE/3G/2G (auto connect) needs software modification to enforce manual selection. My telecom provider Airtel is pushing and forcing me to 2G connection only. I must be able to enforce 4G LTE that I cannot as the UI software has no provision. SAMSUNG must correct this mistake and release software update immediately.
Further, they have provided net based user manual that is VERY GOOD and very exhaustive.  In stead they should have provided a pdf version of user manual.  It will be if SAMSUNG will also give, to customers needing, the technical manual as well!
Sound quality and volume is not that good. Just satisfactory.

Battery life is crazy good, it will last you two days easy.
Super smooth UI and very powerful processing, feels very premium like the Samsung galaxy S9.

Speakers are loud and clear.

Fingerprint scanner is fast but your finger needs to be scanned on the flat part unlike the MI fingerprint readers which will read your finger at any part and any angle. But still not a deal breaker.

Screen is beautiful as all Samsung AMOLED screens are, also gets very bright and very dark.

Even for its massive battery, the phone is very thin and sleek, even the camera bumb which is unique.

10/10 in all categories

The MonsterM30s. Giving My Review after usung more than 1 week.
1.Camera- WORST camera you will get at this price segment. The Company said it had 48MP but it don't perform like that. I don't know whether the software issue or Hardware.
2.Battery- Yes 5830 mAh massive battery but it will perform only 6-7 hours of screen time which is about 1 days back up. Ok I'm satisfied with battery.
3. Games- please don't purchase this mobile for Game like PUBG,Call Of Duty, Asphalt.
Gets lot of lag in it and the heating as well.
4. OS- I don't Like the OS it doesn't have features like- dual app use, screen recorder and lot more that you will get on other android phones.
5. PLEASE Go for SNAPDRAGON processor,  this phone has Exynos9611.
6. I don't Recommend this phone to Gamers and Photography.

Updating my last review-
Never thought would be writing this. Bought M30S for my Dad on his his b'day. He is been using the phone for somewhat over a month.
2nd Dec-  I just reached office when I got a call from home. There was ample stress in his voice when I picked us. He said, 'phone's rear camera glass has exploded. We (my papa and maa) were in the pooja ghar when we heard the sound from the bed room. We rushed and saw there was no glass over the rear camera and when we switched the camera ON is is not working.' Was totally appalled hearing this. This could have been disastrous. Don't know if I will ever be okay with Samsung even if they replace it.

I like the phone the display is good .battery life s ok not too great for a 6000 man battery ..medium usage it survives for 1.5 days ..inbuilt apps from customized android uses more power ..the back case is a little too plasticky..front camera is ok not good as a 6mp. Overall for the money it's a decent buy

I'm writing this review after one week of my purchase. I ordered it on 28th September and I got it on the very next day.
Pros:
1) Display! It offers Super Amoled Display at this price!
2) 6000 mah Monster battery! It's more than enough for heavy users like me.
3) It's performance. Exynos does its job.
4) Looks are stunning. I ordered Sapphire blue  and it looks premium.
5) Camera. I won't say it's great. But provided that with this price, it's decent.
6) Dolby Atmos in Headset mode is great.
Cons:
1) It's plastic back.
2) Photos taken in low light are not that good.
3) Charger cable is very short in length.
4) No option to delete company's apps.

But with the given price and features, I would say that it's the best phone one could buy right now.

I'm actually using a Samsung Galaxy A9pro 2016 model about 2+ years.

But now im switching to Samsung Galaxy m30s

Everything is damn good...  🤙battery life, navigation gestures, fingerprint reader, weight balance, Chipset performance... I'm not a heavy Camara user but overall m30s is nice upgrade for me,
except phone width size.

Overall nice mobile. I am using it for the last 3 months. My disappointment is on fingerprint reader. It does not work as Moto G4 plus fingerprint. Another disappointment is on sound quality for media player. Voice calling is awesome but watching a movie on it is terrible due to less sound. Here Moto G4 plus was winner again.

Pros:
Camera quality
Battery power
Call recorder
Screen touch and size
Intelligent sensors

Cons:
Sound volume
Fingerprint reader

Its not SAMSUNG M30s it's look like Samsung M30
1.They told camera 48MP but its performing like 24MP front camera Also VERY LESS quality 48MP=24MP
2.Bettery also not like 6000mah looks like 4500mah if you use continually it will come 14 to 15Hours
6000mah=4500mah
3.To get full charge it's taking nearly 4 to 5 hours while charging it's showing fast charging but it's not!!
4.Offers and cost is okay.
5.if you use continually 1 to 2 Hours it's getting heat ( NOW ALL MOBILES ARE SAME)
NOTE:I ABSORBED 2 DAYS BASED ON THAT I HAVE GIVEN THIS REVIEW, I GOT IT 30SEP EARLY MORNING.

Best smartphone within this price range.
Just go for it.
Like: -
Processor - too good , no hanging and all, and quick power on and off .

Screen - amoled display and of Samsung it's just amazing with best light effects and clarity.

Camera - there are all the options live , slow motion , food etc and zoom is excellent.

Soecial Feature - Multi split and multi pop up I loved this.

Battery- 6000mah with full use battery drains after two days with full charge. Just awesome .
Dislikes: -
Weight wise bit heavy , but it's due to battery its expected.

Overall a very good smartphone  this is what I really wanted to buy and now I have it and really enjoying it.

If you want to experience the real clarity go for it.

Before buying this phone, I tried reading all reviews and found out that M30s is far better than note 8 pro and realme 5 pro.

Pros :
1. First impression of this phone catched my eyes, Super AMOLED display is very attractive and the build quality is fine
2. Battery stays for 1.5 day long for normal usage
3. Processor is impressive , Never felt a single glitch or stuck while playing pubg
4. Phone charges from 0 to 100 percentage by 2.5 hours
5. Night mode in Samsung one UI brings extremely elegant design.

Cons :
1. Fingerprint reader is very poor, Also phone doesnt wake screen when we place finger on the touchscreen
2. Inbuilt speakers doesnt have loud sounds as expected
3. Camera quality doesnt reach upto expectation(Sony IMX sensor) , Still fine

Battery life is really commendable. The phone is sleek and feels good to hold. I felt the camera was good, not very great. I expected a little more with the triple camera hype. It isn't bad. It is good but not great. Outdoor photography is very good. In artificial light, or even during day time with a little less light, the photos seems to have some noise.

I am very disappointed by this product .

May be I donot know this phone well. But I donot have the means to use it. Since I donot get manual with it.

On my previous Samsung phone " pro 7" I could change the language from English to hindi to gujarati etc. Here I cannot find how to do it.

Also,if my contact have more then one phone number then I cannot do it on my contact list.

Also ,the space on WhatsApp is very short. In the sence the width of the msg space is lesser.

There are many things I need to know if someone is ready to help me to learn it.

I really liked my previous Samsung phone compare to this.

1st time I tried using samsung galaxy m30s .its very good in quality . Easy to handle,  battery quality very fast charging . Camera front and back it's so good . Coming to other feature like display volume all it's super.

Bag draw back is no mobile back case and temper glass given for this . As it's a new launch in market it's very hard to get back case with in the time periods out of stock.  So pls provide back case for it . .

Other than that it's a best product to purchase for this affordable price .

Pros-
1.Great battery life, (easily lasts for the whole day) and even for a 6000mAh battery, it gets charged pretty quickly with the 15W fast charger.

2.Good rear camera.
3.Smooth and clean UI, no ads at all.
4.Fast Fingerprint sensor
5.Regular software updates
6.Great design.
7.SAmoled screen gives a very premium feel.
8.Light weight despite that fact that it has that 6000mAh battery :)

Cons-
1.Front Camera and Night mode could have been better. Not that good for low light conditions.

2. The speakers are decent enough but could have been louder.

3. No back cover and earphones included in the box. It would have been a plus.

4.Noticed some Minor lags. Especially while using Play Music.

Completely  satisfied about my samsung m30s. Pearl white is super classy and beautiful, that colour has given phone a good look.

camera quality is damn good. Night mode came unexpectedly  awesome. 2 photos attached where taken at night 8pm.

There are two options to take photos, wideangle and focused one, which are useful at different instances. it has slow motion, pro, panorama , super slow and hyperlase. Nothing to be disappointed about camera.

Sound quality is perfect.
touch screen and sensitivity is super smooth.
It has dash charging amd battery power is good.
battery was withstanding for many hours even with gps and mobile data on.

blue light, night mode, battery saver (even then all apps can be used, not just basic) are some of the happy go features.

Bought this about a month back. Wanted to use it for a month before posting a review. In my view samsung m30s is by far the best mobile in the price range of 14-17k. The fingerprint reader is super fast. The rear camera of 48 megapixel is also so very good. The front selfie camera is also so very good. I have got the 128 GB and 6gb Ram mobile. The best thing about this mobile is the 6000 m a h battery. The previous phones that I have used needed charging daily and sometimes twice a day. Now I need to charge my phone once in 2 to 3 days. High graphic games also work fine on this mobile. Overall I give this mobile 5 out of 5. A better mobile in this price range has yet to come.

Wonderful screen quality. Camera is also good. Battery life is superb. It won't feel like middle range phone, many times I feel I own a high range phone. Compass sensor is a surprise. Thanks for Samsung for coming up with this quality product. I am totally satisfied. I am not heavy gamer not checked from that aspect. Especially wide angle photo feature is very useful. Photo has lot of details.

I have already escalated this issue to Amazon for this issue till i am waiting for resolution...

This phone delivers on each and every front. I have the 6 + 128 GB version. This phone features a phenomenal 1.7 GHz 9611 Exynos processor, that delivers glitch-free gaming experience. On my device, I tried Need for Speed, PES 2019 and WWE Supercard game. The phone feels great to hold with a seamless curved panel that meets the display up front. Under the hood, Samsung M30s has an amazing 6000 Mah battery. It provides 1.5 days of battery life for me (I use my phone a lot). On the camera front, it doesn't disappoint either. It comes in handy in low-light conditions and Live Focus does a decent job at separating background from the subject.

Finger print scanner of my phone was gone inside of the body when i used to place my finger to scan it use to go inside ,so ordered for replacement. The replacement product had also repeated the fault and fault was more than the previous product,the replacef m30s fingerprint scanner was gone more inside than earlier product . To explain it there was a gap between body and fingerprint scanner of m30s so unfortunately i have to return the product and asked for refund and currently the process is in progress.

The talk volume on phone calls is extremely low.  Have installed Volume Booster App which is a marginal improvement
The Battery drains very fast.
The Dual Band 5 GHz Wifi is good and bought this phone because current Moto G4 Play doesn't support Dual Band Wifi.

Really appreciate for Fingerprint reader, awesome  camera quality. I am too much happy with slow motion videos in day light. Some time didn't gate good slow motion video quality in low light/ night but normal video and photos gives better results totyaly satisfied with camera and features. This phone particularly design for max batter and off course samsung stick with word but battery drains almost 80% in one day when (just for test) i use full day Mobile internate for youtube,online games and other social sides and services but with the remaining 20% battery i use mobile without charging, Internet,wifi, gaming for next 8 hrs. That's for all in one mobile device.

Awesome Phone big battery full day working all apps in single charging battery.. best camera in this budget..above picis the result.. Must buy mobile phone..love it..

Worth Every Single Penny
Detailed Review:

Camera: The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots. Additional zoom-out features for both front and rear camera is nice to have.

Battery: I am really happy with battery backup as it lasts up to approx 2 days. Yes, approx 48 hours with medium usage including WiFi and GPS.

Design, Touch, Look &amp; Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light.

The face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock. The processing speed is good enough for heavy games without much heating effect.

Everything is perfect in this phone but the single and main problem is that calls dont connect immediately, calls get disconnected. I am 1day late to return this product or get an replacement and have wasted my hard earned money. Now request you not to opt for this phone as it has got some major problems which you will come to know gradually.  So its a big no for this mob

What i liked :
Super Amoled screen
Battery backup is awesome
Price for Brand like Samsung and cashback from amazon
Delivery time

What needs improvement :
Camera(front and back) is ok but not great. Doesn't show the real picture. Gave some greenish look.
Mild heating issues with regular use.
Would have been great if comes with Cover and screen gaurd.

The Galaxy M30s is worthy upgrade to the M30. With a bigger 6,000mAh battery and new Exynos 9611 processor, the M30s feels more relevant than the M30 and i in a better position to take on the competition in the affordable mid-range segment. It's introductory launch price of Rs 13,999 also makes it more affordable compared to the Rs 14,990 launch price of the M30.

At this price point, the Galaxy M30s is a great choice for anyone looking for a smartphone with a long-lasting battery. The 6,000mAh battery is clearly the biggest reason to buy the M30s, but it is also nice to see the phone offer an all-round experience. Day-to-day performance of the phone and the 48MP triple cameras are good given the price, and Samsung never fails when it comes to delivering a stunning display.

One of the best phones in the market. The specs are terrific for the price that it is being offered at. Very way to use and battery lasts for almost 2 days with moderate use. Processor and RAM is good which gives a smooth experience. I bought the 6 GB/128 GB version. Highly recommended and a much better alternate to buying the expensive phones which have similar spec but priced much higher

I have already used this phone for quite some time now and I can surely say that the Display quality, battery life, performance in everyday tasks like Music, Web browsing, Camera and other apps work very well without any lag or Hiccups. Photos from the back camera are also very nice and have good details. The only downside (but not Deal breaker considering price) to some extent on this phone is the front camera which is above Average and does its job but can be improved for sure.

Samsung Galaxy M30s (Opal Black, 6GB RAM, Super AMOLED Display, 128GB Storage, 6000mAH Battery) has been recently purchased by me and found good in attractive price.

Performance of Battery and Fingerprint sensor are excellent, camera needs some improvements/fine tuning.
Importantly, the phone sometimes slows down a bit in spite of higher memory and huge free storage.
After disconnection/end of voice call, the phone observed not waking up and needs some side buttons to be pressed.

Rest looks OK. I shall be able to provide more review comments after 3 more months of usage.

With Best Regards,

Everything thing is OK. I would have easily given 5 stars but for the software updation. But when it comes to updating the software update its a big failure. Whenever I'm trying to update the software update it simply says "Invalid update. Try after some time. But every time the same  story continues. Without updation how to upgrade the phone. Sorry Samsung A poor display. You have miserably failed to meet out the ordinary expectation of a faithful customer

Its almost a month using samsung galaxy M30s. Its working great. Fully satisfied with it. In this price range you won't find any phone better than this.
 Camera quality is not so good but also not so bad.
 Battery life is amazing, it works for almost one and half day on single charge.
Touch screen is way smooth, its like you are using any high end smart phone.
Fingerprint sensor and face detector is working good and fast.
Till now phone doesn't hang.
I was using one plus 5t before. And I am more satisfied with M30s than oneplus 5t.
I bought pearl white 6 gb M30s. Pearl white looks decent and rich.
At this price the phone is all in one package.
So if you are planning to buy a new phone, without any second thought you can buy this.

It's awesome at this range.
I've been using different Samsung phones-Galacy SII,Galaxy A8, till now. Now, continuing the loyalty with Samsung. Was able to transfer all data from Samsung.com back to the new phone easily.
Had compared the specifications of several phones but couldn't resist continuing with Samsung.
I would highly recommend buying it.

Mid Range phone, Good value for money
Speaker Sound is normal
Screen is very good  color contrast and all is amaze really nothing is like a amoled screen
Battery is super boost 24 hrs long battery backup so I not need powerband or something
Camera is ok ok front is not that great but it doesn't matter at this price u can't compare with other premium phone
Due to plastic body and unprotected screen u need to buy with insurance and good body protection is need to used if your uses is high and rough

Cons the color gradient on back not looked premium from near distance they just paint with two shade of color which look poor finished

Overall satisfactory product based on after 7 days use

Firstly I would like to say that Samsung Galaxy M30s is awesome. Actually this was my pre birthday gift from my brother. When I received  this phone I was not much satisfied but once I started using it it was fantastic. The best feature that I like the most is its triple rear camera and 16MP front camera wow that's so cool. Secondly I liked the most important of all is its battery of 6000mAH. Nowadays people spend much of their time using phone but this draines the phone battery soon. But in this case i would recommend Samsung Galaxy M30s because once you full the battery you can use it to the maximum in browsing, playing, listening music, watching movies etc. Lastly I would like to say that Samsung Galaxy M30s is mindblowing😍.

I fully recommend Samsung M30S...
Thank You Samsung &amp; Thank You Amazon.

Build quality is good considering the price.
Battery is absolutely beast.
Got screen on time of about 10 hrs.
Charging time is about 2.5 hrs (could be improved).
Performance is perfect in this segment better than redmi note 7 pro.
Best part is screen is is absolutely gorgeous sAmoled is best display for any smartphone.
And 48 mph camera in back is again best in the segment as it is gm2 instead of one compatible to IMX586.
I don't know how Samsung manage to do this but it is absolutely sweet.
One UI is the best android customization I have come across after oxygen.
This is the best phone for 14k.
Samsung is now on par with realme and xiomi in budget segment.

Finger print reader is as fast as i have ever seen, but face detection is somewhat slow.
Camera quality is not meet to brand name SAMSUNG .. As 48MP camera is not upto the mark of name SAMSUNG.... overall camera is fantastic while comparing others mobile.
And battery life... Its marvelous... I never seen that much battery life ever... I m continuous user of mobile for whole day but still it goes for 1½ day n some time 2 days.... Which is fantastic... Other phone i had to change them twice a day but this gives mi chhutti from changing frequently. 😘
Overall performance of phone is worth and upto the marks set by other phone of same range.... I have fully satisfied with Samsung galaxy M30s ( my first Samsung phone )

Hi Team,

I took the product in a sale,Onces the product is delivered I have changed the phone imdefinitely phone got heated at extreme level...
Within couple of hours tried to communicate with Amazon customer service team.I was surprised by there response.
Please Note this:- The return order can't placed from the customer end even though we receive the defective product.There is a hectic procedure they are going to follow they are going to validate the things at macro level.Anyhow at each and every level eg:- temperature, hardware tests etc it had failed...So they had accepted for return..please think before you order this kind of products ..

Writing the review after 4 days. Samsung m30s is good in many aspects. I am using 6GB variant. Considering its huge battery, for me it last more than a day on a single full charge. A really good processor with faster app opening smooth running and ram management is too good. And the display of the phone is more than awesome.
The another main highlight is camera. Its one of the best camera in this range and the super steady mode in the video will make you fall in love. I have attached few photos too.
On the other hand there are some cons too which pulled me to give 4 star i.e. Tge phone heats within 15-20 minutes of pub g playing or other heavy games. The front camera is 16mp though it lacks sharpness. The biggest con is its plastic back.
Thank you.
I hope this review will be helpful

Am writing this review after 2 months of use..  am impressed with overall quality. All apps quick enough with this 6GB ram. Battery very obviously fabulous.. did quick comparison with one plus 6 and this one is snappy..  no heating issues but am not a guy using graphics stuff or games much. Connecting well with bt devices. Dual sim works well... what not... for this pricing this is an absolute winner.

For my usage profile I do not see any specific cons at this point of time.

Anyone looking for phone at this pricing zone.. just go for it.  Thanks.

After many confusions went with M30s on the first sale just for the brand value samsung after 10 years. My first smart phone was Galaxy Ace and it took 10 yrs to go back to samsung in the phone segment. Coming to the point about Pros n cons

Pros: Stunning display, killer battery life, performance is good for day today user. Havent tried any games in it so i dont feel any slowness r lags.

Cons: camera is not upto the mark like as they advertised. Sony IMX sensor is much better than this samsung sensor. May be an OTA update vcan improve the camera performance. There is no ambient light sensor and samsung should really consider these things in midrange handsets as many are providing all the sensors.

There is no case in the box which is very disappointing just to cut the cost.

Pros. A nice phone with good battery backup.
In this phone they added slomo super slomo and time lapse too so it's good. Display is obviously nice because of super amoled and the brand is plus point. I am heavy uses of cell phone but still phone last one day easily.
Cons: only thing I can find is the camera. Obviously other brands gives better camera but for me battery and display was top most priority and its giving me the same so the phone suits me and rest camera is also not bad its decent good one.

Editing it after 4 months use.

Even if the phone is having 4GB ram and good processor the phone started hanging. Even if it using some 2-3 normal apps it hang. So think again before buying.

Hi guys.

Am facing this slow charging issue after 2 months when I was purchased. I don't know what was the reason, it will take around 5hrs from 23% to 90% (I enabled fast charging). If I keep charge from 0 to 💯% definitely take 7 to 8 hrs.
Same I complaint to Samsung help line.they just telling me 2 visit service centre.
In service centre they simply rewriting or updating the software then they are telling issue cleared.
I have visited more than 3times, they simply updating software.
Am Very disappointed for this issue and they not giving me a good solution. I hate this product under 15k. Even battery backup also not much as I expected.

I checked my charger and cable with other mobile and am sure that it was good. And I tried my phone with another m30s charger.but it's charging like same.

#Disgusting_SamsungM30s 👿

Battery life is not much as good as i expected. On display timing is 9hrs only,camera also average.
Remaining all impressive😍

Display-10/10 the best display you could get in this price range.
Battery-10/10 can easily last for 2 days and 1.5 days for heavy users like me
There is no info on the display glass whether it's a gorilla glass but the screen scratches at a level 6 pick which means it can easily withstand day to day scratches from sharp objects
Processor is super smooth and I find no lag as of now
If you can afford a little more I would personally suggest you to go for the 6gb variant
No heating issues and the call quality both reception and speaking is of good quality

Overall a great phone from Samsung
Don't think too much just go for it
A big thumbs to Samsung for M30s

I won't believe Samsung brands, but this time unfortunately SONY is not available in india so that only I bought Samsung m30s mobile,.Again again they proved their worst quality. Out look is very bad, Fingerprint reader is very very worst, after one month gone, now it's hanging and heavy heating issue. When switched off and switched on again it won't start just displaying "SAMSUNG". Battery is huge 6000mah but not much capable for average usage. Very less no of sensors, display is only just average for this price.Too Bulky, Too much weight. Better see other brands. SAMSUNG Name of worst,  cheapest QUALITY.

Excellent finish and camera quality. Back colour is not so attractive like the Samsung M30 blue. Could be better.

Other functionalities are really good for the price. Just a suggestion: Samsung can bundle the antivirus &amp; tampered glass fixed free for a year initially while selling.

I am using 6 128 gb varient from 6-8 days
Pros:
 -battery is awsome u can use it upto 2 or more days with normal use
 -i play cod with no lags and problem and it processes smoothly
 -display quality is good
 -in night mode camera is good
 -fingerprint sensor is fast and face unlock also

Cons-
 -samsung camera is poor it gives lots of feature but quality is poor may they can improve in update
 -i find there ui boaring and simple (it sucks)
 -talking about ergonomics  the length of device is quite large either they should decrease the length by 0.5-1 cm because while using shifting from bottom fo top u have to slide the phone or they should increase width

If u want the mobile for gaming and other stuff and camera is not priority then it may be good choice

Superfast. Camera quality is good. One new fiture I have seen here I.e. wide angle photos. Slow motion and ultra slow motion videos also u can record. Front camera is also good. As I was using Redmi note 3, in thati couldn't use camera in night , pics were so blurry. But I have taken good images with Samsung M30s in night light also, I.eso impressive
Processor is good. It's very fast . U can play games very smoothly. Screen is big, so another new thing for me . Brightness is good. First time I have purchased sapphire blue. So it looks very good. Its blueish n greenish combination on edges. As Samsung is a brand all knows. Another thing, since three days I m using it bt I hvnt experience the heatness.

Day 5: Fingerprint reader is working very well
Camera quality is acceptable for the price
Video quality is also good
Slowmo and superslowmo and 4k video recordings are working smoothly
Battery is keeping up for nearly 1 and a half day in normal use and about a day in high usage
Speaker sound is far better than normal budget Samsung ones
Call and network quality is good
Face unlock feature requires moderate light for the face to be recognized
Having some problem with sd card reading
Tips:- use a tempered glass and a guard for better safety

2. charging time am surprised to see this 6000mah battery with only 15 watts charger

Like the name suggest the phone packs with a monster battery which can be easly get u through 1 day for a heavy user. The camera quality and  performance is much better than its predecessor m30. Fingerprint reader and face id is comparatively fast. PUBG @ high, COD @ mid graphics settings are by default. No problem with smooth gameplay. As always samsung maintain a Full HD + amoled display to its high quality. Crisp and vivd screen. 15w Fast charger included with box.

Pros:
Battery
Display
Comparatively light it doesn't feel like 6000Mah battery inside.

Cons:
Small heating problem.

Verdict: If you are looking for a phone between 13k to 18k your option are going to be Vivo Z1x, Realme X2, Redmi Note 8 pro and Samsung M30s. Benchmarks may vary but you dont see much of a pratical difference in daily usage in terms of performence. But the actual difference u are going to notice is in battery life. If you are a heavy user like me go with big battery all others are not much of a big game chainger.

I am using this mobile from 3 days ..processing is seamless including pubg offcourse.I tinny improvement in camera and processor side..and M30s is more then awsome.. seeing overall specification ..and real life experience well done samsung...great phone

I am disappointed with this Samsung Mobile. Body is made of cheap plastic. Camera quality is highly disappointing.  The colour reproduction of camera is far from natural and reality.  Front camera is worse. Also the sound output of loudspeaker is below average. Repenting now for purchasing this handset of Samsung.  I should have purchased Redme note 8 pro or Realme X2 for little more money extra.

This phone is above my expectations at this price point of view. As a student earlier i was looking for a phone which has all features which are most important for day to day life like huge battery backup which supports fast charging, performance, type-c usb cable, large storage with external sd card slot available, full hd+ display, large ram, and a awesome camera with 4k recording which has image stabilization capability. After getting all this useful features for just 17k i couldn't let go off this deal. Samsung has really started to levelup it's game for midrange phone. If anyone planning to buy this phone go ahead without giving a second thought.

The only thing i liked in this damn phone is its camera rest is of very poor quality. its display is very poor display,it broke after falling from just two feet high and it is not providing a 6000 mah battery backup it provides only about 3500 mah battery backup.plzz friends if u dont want to break ur heart avoid this phone as it do not provide the quality which they claim.I think my old phone had much better display quality and battery backup.
Please don't waste your money in this damn phone as it provides u with wrong info.
Advantage:
only one i.e., its camera quality
Dis-advantage:
1.Poor Display Durability.
2.Poor Battery backup.
3.Average RAM management.

Suggestion towards buyers:
If u don't worry about your money u can go for it...

I got my Samsung M30s at the start of this month. The phone is slim and easy to carry. Battery Life is really a monster. I'm a heavy user but fornme it lasted 2days with heavy usage. Camera quality is good.  Selfie was good even in night light. Wide photos can cover a lot more space than other wide lens. This phone has Widevine L1 with this i can stream 1080p contents on streaming apps like prime video. My previous samsung had finger print in the front, so it took me some time to use back fingerprint . FP is really fast and easily you also also jus swipe to unlock. When the phone is unlocked You can swipe on fp to get your notification bar open and close it.

All specs and quality of mobile is good as expected. no any cons as any youtuber like camera quality,heating gaming,network.good sharpness in selfie not very good that does not matter because the dynamic range,exposures and colours of picture quality is awesome.gm2 sensor is better than gm1 as gm2 is used in galaxyA80 and gm1 sensor is used in redmi note 7 &amp;8,.samsung want to increase his online market share, so he gives his best that he can give .

The Samsung galaxy M30 s is one of the best budget phones from Samsung. The 48mp triple camera shoots very well excepting maybe some night mode photos. The battery is honestly unbeatable, a 6000 mAh battery only before seen in the Asus ROG Phone 2. The fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow for a dedicated scanner and does on par with in display scanners like that of the OnePlus 6t. A but disappointed with that. An overall good package for a sub 14k phone.

This phone is a blockbuster. The look is awesome. I brought this phone just a week back and am happy with the purchase. 😀

Pros:
1. The water drop notch is also very very attractive.
2. Personally,  I see no problem with the speed of the phone while using apps or playing games.
3. Not to mention about the battery life.  It has a huge battery which can easily push your phone for a day and a half.
4. The Super Amoled screen gives the phone an extra advantage over other phones in this range.
5. Fingerprint sensor works fine. The face recognition is also fast.

Cons:
1. The back of the phone is slightly slippery.  However,  the back cover should eliminate this drawback, if at all.

Go for it! 👍

Thanks! 😀

Plz never buy samsung midrange smartphone. They are fooling customer by showing specifications big battery, sAmoled display. And giving name to their model like go monster, ultra monster, big monster etc . I have recently purchased their go monster category i.e Samsung galaxy m30s. But it has a lot of network connection issue. So stay away from samsung midrange smartphone

M30s Display is really awesome for watching movies and videos
One UI is one of the major plus for this mobile but only limited options give
Goodlock is not working same processor  used for A50s good lock is working, try fix this issue in update otherwise waste for buying this mobile.
Fingerprint working dam slow but accurate

Most worst thing is promotional ads are displaying mostly samsung trying say it's customers don't buy our product we give most number of ads.

M30s is monster but battery optimization is not that much great.
Camera decent in day light conditions but while night very average performance

Overall decent mobile for common usage people for heavy and moderate users can use this mobile more days.

1) Starting with its display, it's 6.4inch FHD+ Super AMOLED which is very crisp and best in class where no other brand can outsmart Samsung's Display.

2) Camera :Daylight camera is awesome and lags a bit in low light, but I am happy with this enough in this price range. And it's "say Wowww" to it's super slow motion.

3) Fingerprint reader is smooth and very fast

4) Battery : Monster 6000mah battery 🔥🔥🔥 Really refuses to drain

5) Exynos 9611 processor with game booster helps to play lag free games 💫

6) very low SAR value =0.44 W/kg , only Samsung can provide.

7) Dolby Atmos Experience sound in Stereo headphones 🔥

8) Widevine L1 certificate to play HD content in Netflix

The thing I miss in this mobile is Bixby support and Knox security 🙃

Everything is perfect in this phone as far as my requirements are concerned except camera quality. I was using Samsung s7 prior to this and the camera quality of that 12mp phone was awesome. I was going to order Apple XR 64 GB but ordered Samsung M30S only because of monster battery and now after using it almost one month I can say that my decision was correct. I am a moderate user and I manage to use it 3 days with single charge. It takes almost 2.5 hours for charging but it is ok for me because after a complete day usage it takes 20 to 30 min time to charge from 70 to 100 percent. No lag in the phone as far as normal daily use screen quality is also good. It would be a perfect phone if samsung provides timely updates and a better camera.

"No matter whichever phone comes into market, Vivo, oppo, realme, redmi, etc... Old is and will be gold forever..." Comparing these brands with samsung, is simply a baseless thing. Some people won't like it's camera because samsung gives real pictures just like our eyes and the people today are much more interested in edited photographies whick can provide them with an edited face of theirs.  Using this phone since 2 weeks.
Battery: I could never even have imagined that an android phone can give a battery back up for even more than 2 days.

Camera - Very Very unsatisfied - both cameras are not up to the mark under this price bracket.
Battery - performs average use for around 24 hr - which is good enough.
RAM - out of 6 GB phone uses around 3 GB all the time remaining for other Apps.
Processor - Not done any heavy use but performing good for average use.
Charging cable is shorter then any other brand
Initial network connectivity issues there which gets corrected after few days.
Few pre install app not allowed to uninstall.
(ps- Review after only few days use)

All are good qualities in this new phone... camera quality is fine , iam sending along with this an HD image shot by my samsung phone which may be helpful for rating its camera quality...fingerprint reader is also good.. but sometimes feel like it doesn't respond quickly... also sometimes when we press something on screen it feels like it is giving zero response... may be it get hanged for a little while... but despite all these problems i still recommend and prefer Samsung phone as i rely on this brand too much... my previous phone was also from Samsung and it worked for 4 years for me... camera, screen everything was good, i just replaced battery in those 4 years.. otherwise phone was good... so i rely on this brand..

Very poor performance. I bought in December 2019 and I got an update in march 2020. After that the phone never started. All data lost .at last I have to factory reset. Always restarts automatically From beginning. Fingerprint unlock sucks... Only good thing is it's battery life. I am using samsung phone after a long time, not totally satisfied. Please never Go for Samsung phones. I bought this phone that it will be a good choice but totally disappointed. I will never buy any Samsung phones in my life.

If your budget is at the most 14k ,then u should definitely purchase it ,no lag whatsoever task I throw at it. RAM management is absolutely mind boggling(4GB RAM), but the amount of usable storage is somewhat less compared to other phones having 64GB internal.The camera is self sufficient, and is on par with the amount of quirks and features SAMSUNG has added to the camera software.Gaming is another aspect where it doesn't break a sweat.Battery life can easily last upto 2 days and beyond,but the charging takes a hell lot of time, ETA:2.5hrs from 0-100 ,that to with the 15W fast charger supplied in the box.So overall just buy this cell ,if u want a overall balanced package of all things summed up in a budget smartphone.

The 48mp camera was amazing the size of the photo which is taken by 48mp camera was 12MB minimum size and next thing was battery since i was using this phone from Dussra 2019 100% charge gives me a whole day backup easily at the end of the day my phone charging  was 30% after heave use
 Yes it is a gaming phone . Lag free games I experienced 6000mah battery was amazing 0-100% charge takes 02:30 min with fast charger.
Caution: DON'T  LOOSE YOUR FAST CHARGER

 HENCE: I am enjoying the phone
Thankyou Samsung
With love

Many inside bugs are there. I want this more user friendly. And the battery life is OK but not upto the claim. I am uncomfortable with the settings. Music system and volume , night mode ..Such things I guess will be improved soon. Exowcting more from Samsung. A very good attempt. I want to return this . Sorry. Will look for better version of Samsung.  With Camera , music volume , recording , external microphones easy access.
I am not satisfied. Not friendly with the music app, data usage ...many more settings . Fix bugs plz... Samsung earphone plz. They r very good for music. Earphone should be there .
Best thing of this I like is supporting external microphones. 👍
Thank you so much Samsung. Keep growing and keep serving better with your innovation.

I HAVE BEEN USING SAMSUNG PRODUCTS AND I AM IMPRESSED WITH SCREEN SUPER AMOLED QUALITY WHICH IS NOW IMPLEMENTED BY MANY OTHER COMPANIES. ITS RICH COLOR PRESENTATION AND CAMERA IMAGE PROCESSING IS AT PAR AND BEST. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED OPERATIONS ARE UP TO THE MARK AND BATTERY IS THE HIGHLIGHT WHICH MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY MOBILES LAG. SAMSUNG CAN WORK MORE ON GAME BASED PROCESSORS WHICH ATTRACTS ALL CLASS YOUNGSTERS TOWARDS IT. MANY FEATURES LIKE DOODLE, SCREENSHOT,ARE ACCESSIBLE WITH RICH QUALITY. SAMSUNG SHOULD ALSO WORK ON DETAILS OF 4K AND UHD AS IT IS GIVEN IN TV. FINAL VERDICT IS: CLONING MOBILES CAN NEVER COMPETE WITH PATENTED BRANDS WHICH GIVES STRATEGIC OUTCOMES WITH QUALITY.

A brilliant product by Samsung, aggressively priced. This phone packs the features of chinese competitors with quality brand value and performance of Samsung. Battery life is exceptionally long, can last upto 3 days in moderate use. Has no lag in playing COD, no heating, no hanging. Pretty smooth functionality.
Fingerprint reader is super fast and packs in gestures control, which makes it very comfortable to use and quickly unlock phone as well as check notifications.
Camera Quality is also very good, the 48MP lense gives a very vivid view to the photos and the camera modes makes it fun to play around with photography..  night mode is a wonderful addition.

Overall, for the price it comes for, it's the best phone in the range in market.

Awesome delivery by Amazon within 24 hours.
Product quality is not bad for price range of 13K.
Front camera is worst in the segment, rear camera also doesn't give the performance of 48 MP,
Display quality is perfect, Samsung UI also great
Comes to battery, my 4000 mAh Poco F1 gives the same backup almost to the 6000 mAh in this mobile.

Main points are top portion heat like anything while using more, and the plastic body assembly is not perfect

Monstrous battery. One UI just nailed it but it's one of the most fragile phone, you really need to take care especially from free fall and water splash. It's been about a month and I have already managed to knock out the speakers probably will get fixed when I bring it to the service center also the plastic back makes the phone duller as the time passes and yes being made of plastic the paint easily gets removed.
Those concerned with gaming shouldn't even consider getting this phone, leave COD/PUBG or any other FPS the lag appears in games like Brawl Stars, this phone is meant for those who just want to conduct daily basis activities and want a massive power backed up

After 10 days usage,
has heating issue while playing pubg
camera takes time to save picture at 48mp and the pictures doesn't feel like it's 48mp
No lag experienced so far
Fingerprint sensor is a little less sensitive
Customizing options are less.
Battery doesn't feel like it's 6000 mah. I still get 1 to 1.5 day usage.
6.5 /10 overall.

Hi guys, I bought M30s on 29th sept'19. This phone is value for money, its processor, face detection and fingerprint is very fast. Battery is monster, in a single charge it gives you battery backup upto 3 days. Display is awesome. I am very satisfied after getting this phone. Firstly, I was thinking to buy S8 but when I compare the specs of M30s I was shocked as M30s has Exynos 9611 and S8 has Exynos 8895 and there is no comparision between battery. When I was getting lots of specification with reputated brands in 11599, how could I bought other phone. I will suggest M30s over all phones in this range. It is really a monster.

Samsung has delivered a solid phone with all the necessary features at a great price point.
Screen
 super AMOLED display with natural colors and deep blacks like no other smartphone.
Battery
Really good battery, lasts up to 2 days with medium usage. and 1 full day with high-performance usage. with the charger included in the box, charges 40% in 30 mins. But might be faster with a higher watt charger.
Processor
The processor is not premium but does its job and you will have a smooth UI experience without any lag.
Camera
The camera is really good with lots of features, but not the best. so if the camera is very very important to you, maybe look at other options.

This is the new colour and belive me it is really best colour for the youth...and the performace is gr8 the processor works very efficiently... and having no blotware in it the storage+superamoled screen having fhd+ resolution camera is decent night mode is also play good role in low light condition and the monster battery is extremely good. Really value for money if you want to purchase this... 1.5 ui is also works very amazingly in touch to screen response also very great... ram management is also very good new games like call of duty is easily handle by it without any lag in... the colour is plus point for the youth im if you are bored with old and same shade of white and black try for the new one

Go for it if you are looking for a mobile having best battery and display quality under 15000.

Pros -
1. 6000 mah battery
2. Amoled screen
3. Fast fingerprint and face unlock
4. Good rear camera in daylight
5. Polished one UI

Cons -
1. Midrange processor. This mobile is not meant for heavy gaming as its processor  is comparable  with Snapdragon 665
2. Average selfie camera and night photos
3. Buid quality is very poor as its made of plastic so feel less premium compare to glass build mobiles

I got this mobile around 12500 plus screen protection for 1 year in amazon sale offer. For this price,its best value for money mobile.

I'm using the phone for past 3 days. Phone has been modelled good. I always go by brand value. Samsung has justified its brand value for the phone at its price. Though phone lags at some places like camera and unable to sustain heavy loads, it is very much good to use. The screen is pretty good and it is more suitable for lite users like me.

Product is advertised to be a monster. Was happy to gift to my brother, who was looking forward to use it. However, the fun ended when an obstructive band was discovered in the SIM card tray, which bent the tray, and made the removing and inserting the tray difficult. This is a physical/ structural defect.

Amazon doesn't have any pro active helpline. Tried number of times to register my product return, in vain. Also tried repeatedly in vain to call them or get them call me.

So my brother us stuck with a defective phone, and we're unable to get any help.

The two starts awarded are for the Samsung brand, as it has been quite good so far.

Samsung has really started to beat other players at this price point.  Screen is just awesome , vibrant colors , feels really premium. Camera is what you expect from a Samsung phone,  very good.  Now the main part, battery its a monster really upto 9hrs of Screen on time with mixed usage. Overall it was a very good experience, i am more than satisfied.

I like this product because
1. It had a 6000 mah battery and it decreases the charging intervals so that increasing the life of battery. Especially it is useful in short journey and we can manage cellphone without charger.
2. It had a big screen so that it is useful for aged people to read the text and also reduce the stress on fingers.
3. It's easy to unlock the phone with finger print. Just put the finger backside of phone at finger print censar after register of finger print in phone. It's easy and secured.
3. Regarding camera
  I felt a little bit confuse to select 48 mega pixels option. Finally i got that option. I suggest that to take care of it and make this option user friendly.

Fingerprint Reader : It is slow as compared to Mi mobiles. If the phone is not in use for sometime (15-20 mins), the fingerprint  reader will not work in first touch it will work from second touch.

Camera : Sometimes it feel that camera is good sometimes it feel it is not good. But overall camera is good. It depends on lights available at time of click.

Battery Life : After use of around 20 days i am impressed with battery life. I have normal usage of phone. But one thing i observed that while playing video battery drains very fast. With normal usage battery last for 2 days.

One more thing, you have to take care of you device to extend its life. Eletronic components works long time if they have been taken care.

After all these years of shopping from Amazon I have never felt disappointed like I have at this moment, I gifted the samsung galaxy m 30s phone to my wife on her birthday it was a surprise where in the moment she received it she was completely happy and excited however the very next day the phone becomes faulty, and the fault of the phone is after charging it to 100% she was using the phone for looking at YouTube videos, all of a sudden it switches off and could not be turned back on I felt very disappointed at that very moment when I tried to switch it on I cud feel the back of the phone was hot so it could be the battery so My dear Amazon please replace the phone asap

Have been using the M30s since a fortnight. The fingerprint reader is good, have not used camera outdoors yet, but the battery life is not great. Had a 3500mAh Samsung phone which had almost the same battery life.

This is a 15k phone a it lives up to it's price. Thank you Samsung for the 6GB RAM, 128GB ROM phone at this price.

I had purchased this on first sale, it was working fine but after 10 days, last night battery got drained automatically at night in just 5 hours while it was charged 27% and internet was closed and all apps were clear, i don't know how the battery got drained automatically but there is a big problem in battery and 6000 MAh is not a monster as Samsung tell us. RealMe XT's battery goes on long than this Samsung M30s while RealMe XT's battery is only 4000 MAh. So Samsung have fooled us. fingerprint sensor doesn't work properly.
Front camera is not good. But SuperAmoled display is fine and also the sound quality is good.
It comes with already 28 GB full so you get only 100 GB space. And MI phones UI is better. Many cons are there in Samsung's One UI.

I am writing this review after 3 month of usage

Overall fantastic product, build quality is good, battery life is great, doesn't hang much, back camera is good

Battery life is great but less than expected from a 6000mah monster, it would easily last a day with heavy usage and 2 days for regular use

Camera is bit disappointing, low light photography is pathetic. Back camera in daylight is good but selfie camera is poor. Also details in picture is lacking a lot especially when you zoom the pictures you would see details are missing, hope can be fixed by software update

It's amazing experience for using Samsung M30s coz post few years I am using oppo f3 plus while using mainten very well condition (physical) but unfortunately product damaged internal causes after Warranty period.
After purchase samsung M30s and review/star 5/5.
Here touch screen superb quality, with very good battery life, fast charging slim but no heavy (weight) piece for pocket.
Really happy with Samsung M30s thank you for good product samsung team with very good Amazon supplier.

The new M30s is exceptionally wonderful.
Packing a 6000mah li ion battery (which even flagships don't have) you will never have to worry about battery life again.
It's  been a whole month using this phone and i confidently say that this is a phone that will surely suit every indian in yhis/her busy life. The best thing about M30s is that it's  made in India and therefore packs a lots of top notch features for a subtle price..like dolby atmos, 48mp camera, ultra wide, SUPER AMOLED display, and so many more. It's  surely the best phone at it's price range and according to me has no cons. I absolutely love this phone and am sure you would too.

Battery is not up to the expected buy in Demo. I bought it only for battery backup. You told 6000mah. I think it only 3500mah while using this mobile looking like. Do not do business for the sake of money doing frauds with Customers.

Its a perfect smartphone. Its one of the best smartphones which has been launched recently. The best part is that it so fast while performing any task. The picture quality is crystal clear. It has very clear sound. The look of the phone is eye cathing. The storage capcity of 128 Gb and battery of 6000Mah makes it a monster and killer. Samsung has raised its bar once again and proved why its the market leader when it comes to smartphones. ALL in ALL its a super smartphone.

Pros:
1) Massive 6000 mAh battery which helps me do multitasking at ease upto 2 days
2)Camera is a big plus the 48 megapixel lens capture amazing shots along with the ultra wide lens in daylight as well night
3) Portrait mode is just awesome along with it's various editing modes
4)SuperAMOLED screen is very good alongwith 91% screen to body ratio
5)exynos 9611 processor does a great job with respect to multitasking
Cons:
1)Selfie Camera is not good at all doesn't even capture a decent enough shot even in daylight
2)Samsung doesn't give screen protector guard and case with the box at this price point we expect a company like Samsung to include these accessories inside the box
3)The length of the USB type C cable is very short.

Camera  is  too  good  in  day light  but  during  NIGHT  MODE  it is  NOT  AT  ALL  SATISFACTORY.  During the  use of  60 days  I  got  5 days, NETWORK  problems. Regarding  FAST  CHARGING.......What is the use  ?  I find the charging time  taken  from 05 %  to  100 %  totally  3 hours.  IS  THIS  IS  CALLED  FAST  CHARGING  ?  Overall,  M30s,  NOT  AT  ALL  SATISFIED  ME
It is  BEYOND  MY  EXPECTATIONS ...😂😪😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😱😱😱😱😱😭😱😱😱

Except the looks of the phone, the phone is killer in every aspect, be it camera , battery or screen. Everything is amazing.
This phone offers so much that other company can't offer and the biggest plus point of this phone is super amoled screen and 6000 mah battery which last for almost 2 days with average usage on single charge.
If you are planning to not to buy this phone for its camera , then I have to  say that camera quality has improved a lot via updates since its launch and camera is not going to disappoint you now.
So if you are looking forward to purchase this phone, then go for it. It's not gonna disappoint you for sure.

Pros:-Mainly I like the camera features which offers triple camera setup by 48mp main camera and two ultra wide angle camera
The new m30s was powered up by 600mah battery which u whatever do u want to do
Last but not the least is about the fingerprint sensor it can unlock your phone in 0.58sec approx  the display is nice and it is also backed by samoled display which is also used by apple

all is good but let's see about cons

Cons:-the only reson is that it lacks is the main thing is the processor it is samsung exsynos processor
All the phone in this price  segment range are providing the Qualcomm snapdragon processor whith 550 ...

I can suggest this phone for the casual use only for father or mother and grandparents etc

all looks good but  it doesn't seems like 6000mAh battery , its like 4000 or 3050 mAh battery
it gets discharged quietly low
camera 😍😍
charging : from 0-100%  it takes all around 1hr 45mins....  (fast charging)
not a water resistance  phone..
over all cool!!

Product is overall good. What I didnt like is the space allocation. In the brand new condition, I mean without installing any app. It is using 3 GB ram out of 6 GB and 20 GB memory for system out of 128 GB.
I mean android os is using only 3gb ram and 20 gb memory why??? Its kind of cheating with consumer. Is it really need that much system space and ram or they are holding it for advertigements. We all know with 3gb ram and 20 gb memory windows xp can be istall in a computer so why that much is reserved in a phone. Isn't it a cheat from samsung on the name of 128 GB memory phone?

Unbeatable mobile phone ever only for battery performance bt it has some cons also like it takes a lot of time to charge upto 100% and it's rear camera quality also poor it's 48 mp doesn't work like 48 whenever u zoom ur photo clicked by m30s it will show blur or stretch and front quality also worst Mobile box doesnot contain backcover u can experience some heating issue while playing pubgor cod (m30s made from plastic body )
Pros÷battery excellent
Display awesome
Touch response almost good
Performance better than note 7 pro as it has ability to run pubg on hdr
Sound speaker almost good
It has dolby atom on earphone which make m30s little bit good
Myy opinion will be if u want for long battery life purpose then u can buy this phone

3. samsung galaxy m30 Management is very nice.The question of hanging in routine usage has not arisen...

Overall good product but the back cover is cheap quality as when you press the sides of the phone you can hear crackling or clicking sound, camera quality is also a bit grainy ( I am a photographer by hobby so I know about the settings and stuffs).. Overall a good phone

I purchased  this mobile from  Amazon and received my mobile in 2 days in a nice packing. Regarding this mobile, Fingerprint reader, face details even with/without spects and pattern is quick. Battery  life is awesome, it lasts for 2 days even after surfing on websites, watching videos on YouTube, and hanging long hours on social media, and  calling  for long hours. I love touch screen the most smooth functions. Camera is good, I must say it's  very good. Selfies taken from this mobile is of high quality. But when it's zoomed  up  i noticed a little pixelated. But overall I  feel  satisfied with the results I got in this mobile. I really  love to have this mobile. Thank you Samsung for your great work on this mobile phone on offering a really awesome and reasonable price.

Battery life is awesome u can see videos and do gaming upto 2 days unstoppably.But take more time to charge.However I am not happy with camera performance rear and front as well but can be resolved by some software updates.For gaming it's good not the best u can play pubg with smooth graphics settings with high frame rate with out any lag.lastly u all know Samsung is famous for it's super amoled screens so other have no match with it in case of screen like realme 5 pro,realme xt etc.Over all it's the most competitive mobile  Samsung ever have in this price range.so if u love seeing movies,series,videos on mobile then it's for u guys grab it now.

A premium product at an average price ...the camera quality is superb for both front and rear camera . The night mode and good mode is great for me to click pictures ..

Battery is monster ...even with full day usage it stands near 50%..

Face lock works like charm ..

Genuine 2 days hard usage Review:
Pros:
battery very good.
Processor no lags noticed. Pubg gameplay in high graphics.
Display: good but little yellowish, change to white wallpaper and then u will notice.
Cons:
Camera is not worth 48Mp, night light photo is hazy, redmi note 7s camera is better.
Build : not good, below my power button , some sound is coming when i m holding.
Available Ram : 1.5 gb , 2.5 gb is used completely.

Conclusion from my view: quality is not good when compared to price segment.

Physical look is awesome.Its look more better than its shown in picture.
OS is awesome, specially the screen lock stories.
Finger print sensor is good,you can operate the shutter by scrolling your finger through sensor.
Battery life is good.It takes around 2-2.5 hours for complete charge of 6000mah.
Dolby atmos works only on earplugs.
Its asking the update for almost every pre installed app.
Read camera is not upto the mark,its not competing anywhere. Front camera is ok.
Box doesn't contain any earphone or backcover.
Over all its a feature phone with good looks.
Not recomended for those who is looking for a great rear camera.
Thankyou

Bought it thinking of screen and ad free UI. The screen is marvelous. Really good. Battery life is unheard of. I'm easily getting two days usage. The Samsung One UI is clean and lag free. There is one issue though, the camera needs improvement and I believe it is very easy as software updates will rectify it. The indoor images and low light images are not so great. But the camera hardware is good so I feel Samsung will rectify this in future software updates. Fingerprint reader is fine. A bit slow but good. After discount got it for 14300/-, and it's worth it. Processor handles normal gaming and no heating at all. Samsung's UI has no ads and that's why I chose this over Xiaomi. Please don't bring ads in UI. Thank you Samsung. Good job.

I have been using this phone for about a month now. Samsung phones are usually good but this one seems to have a heating problem. I noticed that the upper part of the phone becomes very hot while charging if you are not in AC room then you will notice more heat. I cannot bring the phone near my ear to take call because it was getting so heated up.
2nd problem I noticed is the battery. It's getting drained off very fast if I keep WiFi and WiFi calling enabled. Need to frequently charge.
3rd Problem is the front camera quality, photos got distorted in night time. Cannot take good selfis.

Well, I can't say  much  cause it's been only 2 days  since I  bought it.  Definitely  Samsung is a great phone smooth  feel  like a  premium  phone but this time  phone is a  little bulky not like other maybe  it's due to monstrous battery 6000 MAH.

I never liked Samsung phones but this M30s made me change my mind. The phone is simply great! I just love the display it has, my wife has Realme XT which also has a amoled screen, but the one on Samsung M30s is way better than that on the XT. This phone is not perfect though, it has ok ok camera and build quality could have been better. The screen already has a small scratch as I don't use screen guard, that tells the screen protection is not up to the mark.
Apart from this 2 issues, there's nothing to complain! I just love the new one UI of Samsung, the night mode on this gorgeous amoled screen looks like a dream, and the performance and battery is more than sufficient! A great phone at the end!

Disappointed with this phone.
Camera is just there for use if u wanna use it in case, cant see anything worth for 48mega pixel or triple camera, selfie camera is also just pathetic, i would appreciate VIVO who has much better camera in lower segments then this, only thing i found gud in this phone is battery, sorry to say but my experience with this phone is bad...

I loved this device in mid range the device m30s is brilliant.
of course there will be some pros and cons of every smartphone .
the pros are
1.Battery is monster.
2.Screen is definately good ,brilliant it is.
3.Phone is handy and smoothy in use.
4.Dolby atmos give you better experience in music.
5.Proper backside finish.
6.body to screen ratio is nice.
7.pro mode camera is fantabulous.
8.video recording is quite good.
9.of gaming i didnt tried yet.

the cons are
1.selfie camera disappointed me.
2.notification led is not there.
3.speaker is very good but loudness is not up to the mark you find difficulty in surfing a video with more than 3 guys simultaneously.

I have been using the M30s for almost a month now. The USP of this product will undoubtedly be its battery life which easily lasts 36-40 hours on average use. The Camera is also pretty good, with all the post-click effects and also the wide angle helps capture better clicks without having to move back. It comes with a fingerprint sensor and also face unlock both of which are pretty accurate and fast. I recently went to Paris and clicked a few pictures with this phone, attaching them for your kind perusal. In a nutshell, in this budget,  its the best phone you can buy.

very good product. after using one month i am writing this review.
Battery backup is very good, almost last for 2 days, so is the camera quality. Selfie camera is very good. color reproduction is good. At low light pics quality is decent.
I like the camera interface customization is very easy to find. Also it has a option to  negative zoom in wide angel mode so that u can adjust your extent of wide angel mode.
Display is crisp..its samsung LED bro..what more can i say.Its amazing viewing.
Not a game freak..but operation is smooth..crisp.

It's a decent phone when it comes to looks,specs and build quality.
So far haven't experience any lags/problems in day to day usage.working well. And it's a Samsung brand so no doubt I had to buy it, it seems samsung is coming back with some of it's a and Mseries phones that too in economical costs. Display is amazing as it is a super amoled display but iam a bit disappointed because they have given a plastic body but it really does not impact the looks of the phone and 6000mah battery well it lasts for 2 days easy if you are not using it heavily.
Overall worth the price..

Although I can explain this smartphone in just one word and that is #fantabulous.
I loved it's massive 6000 Mah Battery.
The camera 😍🤩 outstanding in daylight..little bit disappointed in night bcz bulry pic.But not a big deal...ask yourself  what you guys want in this price segment..
Let's  talk about processors it's very fast ⛷ ...
I Played pubg 8 hours on a single full charge..also charging is too fast along with 6000mah...
Its look like #Creem...Dont think too much,Go for it
And last thing I m mentioning is speaker that is loud and clear enough to enjoy a good music...Love it😍😘🥰..
Purchase it I swer u won't be disappointed...
Samsung NAAM HI KAFI H...
Jai Hind!!
Jai Bharat!!

I gifted this phone to my Mother on her birthday!
The fact that she likes photos so much and zooms into every details of her favorite photos, this phone was just the right pick! So much for the photos, the 128GB addresses the storage concern adequately or is rather a surplus! She watches her favourite TV shows whenever she has time and on the go. What a freedom it is to not worry about charging your phone every now and then when there is so much she does in a day! This makes the Samsung's Galaxy M30S the perfect companion for the perfect Her in all respects beating down the competition fair and square!

Cheers!

2days back i have received the phone features are good, battery backup is good 2days back i have charged full till 50% only consumed, camera is awesome good picture quality, but only problem I have observed from last 2 days 3times phone was restarted automatically. I have to see weather it will become a serious problem or after software upgradation this issue may resolve.

After software upgradation also phone is getting  restart frequently,  during that time iam missing calls and messages after restart we have to unlock the phone otherwise it won't work it won't take calls and messages.

Poor network even call will not get connect , sometimes sim's card will not recognize, heating issues, poor quality cameras both Front and Back..
6K mAH battery not up to mark, felling like 3K mAH battery mobile and battery drains very fast and slow charging not 15W fast charging. if use the mobile continuously for 15 to 20 mins mobile will get slow.  completely waste of money.

Everything is amazing here in this Samasung M30s. Only one disappointment is the back panel,its getting scratched easily and the quality was little bit disappointing.  Except this the phone was amazing stunning phone in this price. Please build the back panel with good metal or steel. Don't use plastics it's not up to the level. Bcoz the paint getting out and scratches made on it is easy for even small dust it's getting scratched..

Bang on device from Samsung after long period. Now cheap chinese phone going to despair . As samsung brand itself sufficient.Now producing device like m30s. Awesome . Keep it up . And also this my advise kindly incorporate appa like scanner, walking tracker, screen recorder like small apps which will make samsung super phone over Chinese brands. This can be obtained from third party apps but not reliable . In my opinion Chinese phone are getting edge over on this aspect. So samsung think about it you will see the effect.comeon be killer as you have done by this phone. 👍👌

great product with an aggressive price range
I have bought this giant phone on pre sale on Amazon which started on 28 sept .
Amazing delivery by amazon and I have received this product within 4 hours.
Pros :
6000 mah giant battery which is enough to keep this giant phone ready for usage of almost 2 days.
All new exynos 9611 which has 4 memory channels for better performance.
Super amoled display with 6.4 inch screen.
High quality camera front and rear which clicks photo almost like a dslr.
All new one ui which is very simple to use and didn't find any flaw till now.
Cons:
Still finding one .
So, I would recommend this phone to every user who can spend  under Rs 20000.
Boss Go and Grab this beast right now

I find the display attractive. Games run pretty smoothly except for a few high end games. The phone is pretty fast with less heating issues. The battery is a monster , if you're not playing a lot of games you'll have a very hard time draining it. Camera is great but could've been better for a 48MP camera. Camera panel has the flash besides the camera instead of being below it which makes the camera panel unnecessarily big. Other than that great phone and has a lot if inbuilt features like night mode, blue light filter, always on display, Dolby Atmosphere which enhances  gaming and music experience. Speakers are great, loud and clear. The UI is attractive. I'd say so far so good. Good job Samsung.

Please don’t buy this phone. The reason for this is. It’s very very heavy like you holding a 2kg dumble and it’s lil big n wide so not user friendly and the call quality on this phone is very bad compare to other phone. While talking the speaker quality is very poor. Can’t hear it properly.
Amazon doesn’t have the return policy for this phone. I bought this phone today and sold it on the same day at 10 k due to poor build and performance. All the reviews by techies in YouTube are Bad. Don’t fall for it. Buy any other phone but not this one.

Samsung M30s- One of the best smartphone in this price segment.
Fabulous experience while using this phone.
Have used this phone for nearly one week in my hand, its very cool to use and am satisfied with performance.
Below are my marks for each spec..

*Camera- 9/10 (outdoor-10/10; indoor-8/10)
*Display-10/10
*Battery-10/10
*Processor speed-10/10
*Out speaker- 7/10
*Headphone output- 9/10
*Samsung one Ui- 10/10 ( Bundled with lots with customizable features )
*Charging output- 9/10 (15W Fast charging its good, only thing if they would provided 20- 30 watt charge it would be much useful to charge 6000Mah battery )

Guys, don't buy this phone terrible experience ! the phone is super hyped with great advertising . The phone has issues around charging, hangs sometimes and the worst of all the phone is locked  for use in India only for which the service centre initially promised to assist but later backed out. Amazon never tells that the phones are locked.
Don't ever buy any Samsung product ……….disappointment is guaranteed !!

I am using the new Samsung M30s since last 5 days. And it is the best phone so far in the mid-range. I have used Redmi Note 7 for past few months but M30s is the ultimate killer.
Pros:
The super amoled screen gave me the best experience ever for watching movies and videos.
Battery backup is next level.
Detailing in photos shot by this monster is marvelous. U can see every minute thing in the pic.
The dual tone back gives a premium look. Moreover the round edges at the back gives a perfect hold in hand as comapred to redmi note 7 which was slippery.

Few things which could have been improved:
No Notification LED
No earphones in-box
No backcover in-box

Overall this one is the best phone in this segment.

I bought a Samsung phone for the first time. Everyone gives a negative review of Samsung.
Despite this, I bought the phone for the first time by relying on Samsung. But now I will never buy a Samsung phone.Such an expensive phone and such a useless phone. It was a very cheap Redmi and Realme phone, yet I paid extra money to buy a good Samsung phone.I am requesting everyone to never buy Samsung.😡🤬

Although I didn't recommend anyone to purchase Samsung Products.
But about this phone I can recommend someone to get this one.
Build Quality is good Samsung could also use Metallic body but it still feels good.
Camera quality is quite good. if you are taking pictures on 48MP sensor,
then it takes 2 to 3 secs to save the photographs due to Optimization
Sound Quality was always a minor point in Samsung Phones,
but here it is just killed every cons in sound quality.
the most famous part for samsung was that the phones get heated,
but here it just went opposite to its cons.
it has been one month complete and the phone is quite good in performance.
don't go with negative vibes. Just get this phone.

A very true feedback...
In this range bucket this phone is really amazing..seriously I analyzed approx 6 month to have a new phone..post a long research I finalized M30s..
Phone Quality is very good
Screen visibility is much clear &amp; very smooth touch.
Having 6000 MAH battery, still a very slim look. Battery life is too good..you can use 2 days after done a single full charge.
Qulaity Samoled display gives this phone a another star..
Bit issue which I identified is in fingerprint sensor..sensitivity is bit less as competitive another phone's.
Front camera is good but not too much !!
But must say..Under 20k this one is the best phone.

Worst camera ever, even a 3.2 megapixel camera is better than this 48 MP camera. Only good thing is battery backup,  camera quality  is worst . When contacted Amazon customer care they denied to help regarding  quality issue. NO one should buy samsung and should not buy from Amazon, both are worst companies.  Now I got to know why samsung lost its market position.

Finger print reader does not work well the front camera quality is bad but the rear one which is of 48 mp is awesome the battery life is long but for gamers it lasts till 18 hours and for other purpose it lasts for more than 1 day .These were some advantages and disadvantages but the phone heats fast which I think is a major problem other than that the processor and camera is fabulous it provides extreme with ultra HD in pubg and for hardcore gamers this is not the right choice if you want to only enjoy games than you can buy it and if you are not a gamer than my friend it is the best phone you have ever came across

  Thank you

This smartphone sported an AMOLED display and offered good battery life. The 6,000mAh battery helps the phone deliver great battery life.
  The Samsung Galaxy M30s runs One UI based on Android 9 Pie and packs 64GB of inbuilt storage that can be expanded via microSD card (up to 512GB) with a dedicated slot. The Samsung Galaxy M30s is a dual-SIM (GSM and GSM) smartphone that accepts Nano-SIM and Nano-SIM cards.
  As far as the cameras are concerned, the Samsung Galaxy M30s on the rear packs a 48-megapixel primary camera with an f/2.0 aperture; a second 5-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a third 8-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture. The rear camera setup has autofocus. It sports a 16-megapixel camera on the front for selfies.

Vodafone sim does not work. How can Samsung release the phone without testing properly. Have tried every possible solution. Got a replacement from Amazon after wasting many hours on the call, which has exactly the same issue...
Really frustrating...

Battery life is so good, coming to camera quality is also good, but in dark light some blurr is appears, coming to phone it's giving some heat while watching YouTube videos, playing games also heating arrives.. Finger print sensor little slow than expected. Audio output was very low, if we not set vibrate over ringing we couldn't recognize weather its ringing or not in driving time.

Got the M30s within 24 hours.  The battery rocks. Coming from a moto g6. This is really good. Good audio. Easy connection and screen share with lg webos TV. Good price and buy. No heating issues. Use the given charger for fast charge.moto fast charger is slow in this.  Screen quality on par with iPhones.

overall a good budget phone. but not a clear winner. beats all other smartphones in terms of battery and display. camera is a big minus. samsung needs to provide some patch to rectify camera issue. its just too bad for the money and specification.

Phone rear camera quality is very poor, main purpose to purchase this product is for 48 megapixel rear camera but very pathetic experience, have surprised picture quality which is very poor even  compared with our existing 16 megapixel honor 7x moblie.
Speaker is also not good compare to its price.
Phone body is not good, knows that plastic body but it's very cheap quality have never expected from brand like Samsung.
We really wanted to return this item but as per the amazon support it's not possible even though quality of the phone is very sad...not sure how to sustain with this phone further...

Fingerprint reader is pretty good and also reads 9 time fingerprint out od 10. Camera Quality is average to good but at this price point Quality is excellent. Batterylife is also good but it doesn't meet my expectations, battery backup is around 2 days with one charge with average usages. Super Amoled display is excellent and with 1080p  full hd+ resolution it beats every phone within this point segment. Performance is also good .
Also get Update of One Ui 2 Android10 which pretty nice . By the way One ui is very stable, clean, and bug free skin. I recommend this device

The processing speed is good. Shouldn't compare with realme  5 pro as it is having better processor. But it gives about the same processing speed of realme except in some cases.
Fingerprint reader performance is average.
Camera quality of rear camera is good. While taking in portraits the blur is slightly low.
The front camera is not much up to the expectations. The images are smoothed and detailing is low.
The battery life is excellent. I think that they should provide a 20 watt fast charger as 6000 mah is huge and it takes more than two and half hours for full charge.
Overall the product is good.
Android 10 update is available for m30s by April 2020 with UI update.

Its getting heated even for short usage. Cant keep near the ear. Amazon is supporting samsung to sell this m30s phones using some blancco app and unexperienced technicians who claim everything is fine. Planning to stop buying gadgets/phones from amazon as i couldnt return this phone. Have been a customer since 6 years but worst experience now. Suggestion from expert: Use BT headset if you want to talk on mobile for 3-4 min. Amazon should sell m30s , only with combo deal. (m30s + BT headset)

All features are good, only it has Samsung Exynos 9 Octa than Snapdragon 665,
Display 6.4" instead of MI A3 6.08 ", Dedicated slot for Memory Card instead of Hybrid, It's never lack and you will be happy after owning this, Dolby ATMOS, Super AMOLED, 1080 x 2340 pixels screen resolution, and additional advantage is extended battery 6000 MAh in light weight 188 grams. sharing some snap taken from M30s.

This is one affordable phone in this price range. Battery, Amoled Display &amp; fingerprint sensor is 👌. But camera is worthless. Gives too much noise even with 48mp camera.  I have used samsung J series &amp; M30S camera is nothing compared to J series. Even A series has better camera though the cost is also high. So if you are not bothered about mobike camera , you can definitely buy M30s. Samsung has to work on its quality &amp; implementation of latest technology could be a good call.

I am using this phone from the 10 days, now the best part of this phone is that its battery quality is best it longs for a day(even if you use it contionusly) but the battery also takes long time to charge; camera is bad ( front camera is good, but back camera is bad) and then UI is not as good as what u expect in Android PIE, processor is little slow( the phone lags at some moment). Delivery of phone is quick by Amazon but the phone is on average, i will only suggest this phone to someone if you want good battery backup unless try something else with same price.

Nothing can beat this phone for the specs it has at this price. Pros and cons have been discussed bat lenght and breadth. Here only giving my personal opinion:

Look of the phone is not sharp, it's bulky.

Camera is not crisp and believing that it houses a 48 MP camera is hard.

The colour of the phone , specially the blue ones which I brought, does look old and faded (owing to its coulor shifting look)
-----

Look is excellent. Face recognition and fingerprint sensitivity is very fast. Camera quality is good but edge detection on live focuse mode (blur effect) should be improved. It will be better if video Stabilization provided in 4K video recording mode. Battery is not fast charging as expected
unlike xiaomi redmi note 5 pro. Thumbnails are invisible in lightroom and instagram "your story" section which is very annoying. It would be more better if this phone also have infra red sensor as like xiaomi redmi phones have to use as remote controler.

I am your old customer and faith &amp; trust on your AMAZON,  want to return due to two reasons, firstly whole description was not on website page as only length of the Mobile was only mentioned as 6.4 inches but width was not mentioned.  As the product is launched on site but not launched on local market, so that's why i was unable to get knowledge of the product from local market i.e regarding its size clarity or Camera Quality as per publicized as 48 which is not as per the quality it should have.  So for both reasons I like to return.  The said story was already to customer care for its return 2 days back but he denies to return but says that he can Replace only not Return.  So I request you to return the product.  Please clear the scene.

After using it for a week i can share my experience with this.
1. Phone's display quality is no doubt extremely well. 5/5
2. Phone comes with 4gb / 6gb ram variant . I own 6 GB variant , no issue in gaming . PUBG , COD runs smooth with no lag issues. Its full hd display will give you  professional experience. 5/5
3 however its camera doesn't meet my expectations. though It claims to have 48 mp rear ,yet its quality seems to be of 16mp. 3/5
4. The most impressive and important quality of the product is its battery. It comes with 6000mah battery with is unbeatable.  Though its not upgraded with fast charging support.  5/5.

Overall you should definitely go for it.

So far the best phone I used till date. With my use I charged my previous phone twice a day but with this one I need charging once in 2 days.
Pros:
1. Display as in specification most vivid and lucid
2. Touch works like charm
3. 6GB +128GB what more can you ask for
4. Camera works great
5. Lightweight
6. 6000mAh battery

Cons:
1. Little big for one hand use

Otherwise best in class smartphone from Samsung.

An absolute killer in this price segment. Samsung has really outdone themselves with this M30s. Totally impressed with the weight distribution considering the phone packs an enormous 6000mah battery. The m30s also delivers an outstanding display. The large screen coupled with the 'mega' battery makes an delightful streaming experience. The overall camera performance is pretty decent but it lacks in low light performance . The wide angle shots was dark and full of noises. The edge detection for live focus  is slightly off. m30s handles multitasking with no interpretations. And even prolonged use didn't lead to any heating issues. The fingerprint sensor is quite fast and responsive.
The sapphire blue variant gives a jazzy appeal

The best quality of this phone is undoubtedly its huge battery life, as I am a really heavy user playing games and watching videos the whole time but even with extremely high usage I am still left with around 40% by the end of the day and with quick charging I am ready with 100% battery back in d morning.. Super amoled screen is the 2nd beautiful thing about this phone... Camera quality is almost amazing dint quite like the front camera quality, but the rear camera is amazing if it's used well... I have added some samples I have clicked (unedited), and a steady shot video... do check it out... Fingerprint scanner is quick and responsive as well as face unlock is great.... With this phone in my hand I can be confident to take this phone anywhere and everywhere and use it the entire day with all the freedom just cause it's battery life is so brilliant... Thank u Samsung this phone is great..

Great phone but don't support Samsung basic stuff like full camera pro mode  I hope the fix those in future update plus battery shows up as 5830 mah instead of 6000 I am getting an avg of 10hrs of screen on time for avg useage . It also don't support Goodlock I know flagship also don't in India but then too , Everything else works fine like no network issue with Airtel , display looks great. One real issue pressing side of phone makes sound not that noticable but you can feel it , and for some reason it didn't support 5ghz hotspot but 5ghz wifi got connected wierd . I like oneui and I was getting it cheap so I bought it but if want nice performance Samsung flagship are great or at low budget go for Redmi Note 7pro or pocof1 .

Am editing this review after using this phone for more than 3months.
Well the battery is good it takes 1 and half hour to get charged completely.
Yes there are heating issue while phone is getting  charged.
Camera pixel is never 48 pixel you just a very low quality image.
Front camera quality is worse.
So with this price there are better smartphones in the market.
And things phone has a problem of delayed touch and also it hangs very quite often which makes ram poor.

I'm old school, and I use the phone for its primary features-call, click pictures, a little gaming and other generic stuff. It works great for me!

*Doesn't overheat
*Great battery
*Good camera in natural light only (front)
*Rear camera is good (48 megapixel is a marketing gimmick)
*Charges very fast
*Get the 6GB version for better usability
*Huge screen
*Decent adaptive brightness
*Flawless gaming

Well, I upgrade my phone once, every two years. So, I didn't  go for a oneplus or iPhone. Makes no sense to spend so much money. Be wise choose this!

I bought it for 16k, and I'm telling you it's a steal!! Go for it. :)

Keep the features and other things aside. I want to know that why Samsung and the sellers of Amazon our doing this. This is the second time I am facing that I have been cheated. The back panel has a manufacturing defect. I don't feel good to return the item for such tiny reason but why I am getting imperfection. I paid full. The last phone I purchased was sealed broken. It feels like Amazon is loosing my trust and an honest customer of years.

Its been 4 days now that I've been using this phone and it's a battery beast!! Battery life has been incredible on this device. It gave me a whopping 2 days of usage with moderate to heavy usage on a single charge. The display is spectacular. No issues in sunlight, no struggles in the night time, it is smooth to eyes even in complete dark. The processor is also a beast I am a heavy user and use 5-6 apps at once and it manages to keep it all in memory with no struggles whatsoever. Cameras are also superb. Love the ultra wide cam. Front camera is good enough for instant social media uploads. If you are looking for a smartphone under 15k, forget oppo, vivo and redmi, this is it!

Everything in any handset depends of the set works fine.. Mine, despite 6GB RAM hangs a lot. Don't have any game installed though. While connected to bluetooth headset for calls, it is bound to hang while accepting an incoming call via the headset. Was earlier using S8 and switched to M30s just for the superb battery however seems besides the battery there is nothing else superb with M30s.

Hi, kartik here, I bought this phone on 2nd of october from Amazon, and I am very happy to have it. I mean this phone is just awesome, it's features are just unmatchable in such a low price, I am loving this phone. Its camera quality is outstanding, I am a salesperson and I got so many calls in a day as maximum of my work is done on phone and guess what it's battery last for two days, I mean its unbelievable, its fingerprint reader is so fast even than a blink of an eye, due to my job profile I am always in a hurry, and this this a perfect phone for a salesperson and marketingperson and businessperson as its processor is very fast, it is very sleek, its colors looks sexy, I mean this phone is full of features. Love Samsung M30s.

Phone is literally amazing but the product i received have a minor dent on back body and the fingerprint reader feels like sunk inside body from one end and response sometimes not well.

The battery lasts around 1 day and 10hr on a full charge. Sound output is good on calls as well as media. The screen is most amazing thing about this phone along with samsung one ui ... the game changer for this segment.

Samsung should include covers for their phones in box by increasing some price on their device that would be very convinient.

There are phones with tall claims but this sweet monster stands up to it 😍

Had brought the phone right before a trek and it's camera was everyone's favourite and it's battery (100-50% in two days at even -10°C; usage was only camera) my personal favourite. Kudos to Samsung for getting it back into the game and one up-ing customer satisfaction to the maximum. Hoping for the honeymoon phase to be a permanent one 😜

Never buy this I repeat never buy this phone. I bought the 6GB version with an exchange. I got the defect piece "you can hear clicking sound on back side and near power button". I concerned an issued an a replacement still I didn't get any replacement and it's still shows my mobile on transit. I got worst service from provider and amazon. Dont ever buy this phone. If your phone have defect you need to live with it.

Excellent Battery back up.
6GB RAM, response is good, EXYNOS Processor works without any Lag. Iam not a gamer though hence my feedback is subjective. Fingerprint sensor is ok. Camera default setting in Full mode will be 12 MP, you have to go to camera settings in the top and change the setting from full to 4:3 to get 48 MP image. Its actually image processor and not a 48 MP lens, is what I could understand. Picture quality is good, but there are some more better camera phones available in the market. I am a heavy user in terms of call and internet and the battery lasts for 1.5 - 2 days max on a single charge (from 100% to 10%)

My review of my new empowered M30s by samsung :

Pros :

1. Camera : samsung has up their game by introducing such an excellent camera in this price range.

2. Battery : It is truly the best thing about the new M30s. Truly deserved to be India's 1st phone with 6000 mAh battery.

3. Design : New colors are excellent. I am in love with my sapphire blue M30s

Almost packed up with all features with 6gb ram and 128gb memory.

This phone is best in this price range and yes it gives you a brand value which you look for.

I am in awe of this and would recommend this phone to everybody.

PS: Attaching few pics from M30s of my recent kerala trip.

Super AMOLED display - surprisingly Super rrr. Fall in love with the Display quality.
Battery is just Awesome. No other smartphone is having this much of battery in this price range.
Fingerprint position is perfect.
Multitasking- You can go on without clearing currently running apps.
For me USB-Type C + 3.5 mm jack just goodness. Thank you for this.
Camera quality is best compared to other smartphones in this price range.
Night mode should be improvised.
Fast charger would have been provided.
Finally something new have been done by the Samsung to beat the competitors.
Overall it's a must buy smartphone in this price range.

There is no doubt that it has monster battery which gets charged quite fast with the charger provided. Screen resolution is perfect but screen is very sensitive. I didn't like UI. Also, only few apps support full screen and you need to enable it. Camera could be better though I need to do some more research. I hope I am missing some settings and it will turn out to be expected monster. I also experienced lag sometimes during basic operations which was not expected from it. Though other times it was quick.
Overall, you don't get everything in single phone in this price range and it gives you almost everything. Even if there are few compromises, I would say - GoMoster

Samsung Galaxy m30 s 6GB ram some times hanging
 battery life also not that good 6000Mah drains with in 24hrs

Not worth for this much rate.

It is just awesome ... Samsung's phone with such features at this price range is a blessing...finger print reader is very fast .. battery life is the best feature it's run smoothly for 36 or 48 hours once fully charge ...even if a listen endless music or even after watching 2 full movies the battery remain above 60 percent ... with 6 GB RAM this 0hone never hang .. I can do a lot of things togather... very much user friendly for both professional workers and students .. it's display and camera quality are also making this phone value for money ... the triple rare camera allow you to take wide angle shots ..plus there are a lot of options and for video lovers there is video stability mode ...front camera is of good quality also but not the best type .....the processor is good... phone is much smoother than it's M30 version or any other phones available at this price ..

I m using this device by 7 days. Its working smoothly and fast with single charge per two days.
Its camara is performing nice , specifically wide angle shots .
Fingerprint sensor response is superfast.
Its black colour variant is more beautiful than other because its Camara box is black and it hides in black colour.
This device is not feeling heavy .
Its shape , design and Super amoled screen is attracting others too.
Really ,I feel it is true value for money.
Fast delivery and 10% instant less in price by sbi card is really make me feel like DIWALI

phone was really dam good for moderate users, i have never expected such a featured mobile in such a good cost.
many mobiles are better than this phone still, when you look out of budget and a moderate use i could see this would be the best mobile in this year.

thanks to Samsung, and very special thanks to amazon pay. who made my sister special day very special with this beautiful gift.

It's design is cool. I like that fingerprints scanner which in back it's always use to unlock mobile. Battery life is good but didn't get full 6000mah. Other configuration is best in low prize with Samsung brand. Amold display is too good and screen size also best. Watching movies and series.... got better experience and enjoyable. Camera quality is poor. But videos are good and other functions are working properly........ I like this product its bye in sept 28 ....still it's not any lagg or hang happen over there.

1st of all sAmoled display of samsung brand has worth it.
one of the best of recent mobiles... the UI of samsung mobiles was just amazing and i love it 😍. And most important thing is the battery nd performance... i bought a 6gb ram the performance of a mobile and speed was very good and battery has the best thing of this... it has almost 2days alive with one time charging..

This phone is as much bang for buck as you could expect. I actually downgraded to this phone from a OnePlus--and I miss nothing. Absolutely nothing. The screen resolution is top notch, the performance blazing fast, battery life is amazing and the fast charging quick. I'm a heavy user and a full charge easily lasts a day and a half. It's not difficult to pull it for two full days with some care. The camera is great, unlike what some reviews might have said (and I'm a professional photographer). You'll not be left wanting with this phone. It is a premium phone killer. Yes, I wish the body was metal and not as plasticky, but with a case on, that doesn't matter. I'm beyond satisfied.

Ease of use because of optimized speed and efficiency of the latest processor
I liked the Opal black color combination
I got a lot of features in this phone yet at an affordable price.
Both the sim slots are 4G LTE compatible
Face detection and fingerprint sensor work in tandem to provide ease of day-to-day use of the phone
Design  of the screen size - display ratio is par excellence!

I really like the display of the phone everything feels quite smooth I am really  hoping  that Netflix  and  prime update  there app so that I can hear in dolby atmos from the apps and also HDR playback  still not yet from  YouTube or Netflix  etc
It takes a while for full charge like 1-1&amp;1/2 hrs
I really like the fact that they have triple slots for dual sims and  memory card
Another thing that I really liked is the smart view  feature  (cast screen) where it can change the aspect ratio  as per your TV screen  so you don't get any black borders around your TV like when I cast from other phones  and also the phone sleeps after a while when you  cast on tv so I don't see same thing twice and battery gets saved

Monster, a perfect Synonym for the Samsung M30s.
1.The 6000mAH battery does the job. It is my 2 nd day since I have charged the phone and with regular phone and WhatsApp use, 57% charge still remains.
2. Furthermore, the Super AMOLED screen is is crisp and soothing to the eyes.
3.Performance is smooth and lag free. The new Exynos processor and 4GB RAM are on duty.
4. Front and Rear Camera performance is satisfactory at this price point.
5. Features like fingerprint scanner and face unlock works buttery smooth.
Overall a wonderfull experience owning a Samsung product. This is my 5th Samsung phone and M30s has made my brand loyalty stronger.

The galaxy M30s is a phone with high end premium features at a mid range price. For the price it is selling it is a steal deal. The battery is amazing and will last you an entire day on a full charge. The camera quality is superb and the OS is very smooth and easy in operation.
The only issue i feel is with the increase in the speaker volume. When you increase the volume to one below the maximum it's pleasant but the maximum volume just is too much to bear. It's not a deal breaker at all though.

Samsung literally slayed every of it's competitors this time with this new series. This phone is just fantastic, battery life is seriously undeniable, just like samsung said, it's monster. The performance is also truly amazing, I've noticed negligible lag in whatever work I do. Although some more work could've been done on improving gaming performance but that doesn't matter so much since I mainly need this for business and office work, mostly. The most amazing fact about this unit is that the prize is remarkable, the phone is a top notch for this prize. Simply put, the phone is just a monster!

Samsung phone I love very much.Battery is Monster. But after November Security update the Battery is draining rapidly. I didn't play any game on my phone. Less call but morning my phone has 100 percent battery on evening the battery percentage is about 48 percent why. And Camera quality is very bad too much noise. Please Samsung Fix it on security update

I bought  it for 11600 which is a great deal for such a monster phone.
Display and touch response is the best I've seen in the range and far above.
Camera is decent but expected a bit more from rear camera especially being a 48MP one.
Battery performance is great as expected. Easily lasts for one and half day with heavy usage.
Samsung could have provided LED notifications.
Could have provided a transparent case if not earphones atleast as back cover is a fingerprint magnet.
Samsung should use the same back cover design as in A30s as it looks really good.
Nevertheless its an amazing phone for someone battery backup is the top priority.

Overall at this price u get best of it from Samsung 👌
I bought this in offer for Rs. 12,599/-
1.talking about build quality not good 👎 very delicate got scratches on screen as well as on back Panel in 2 days of normal use so u have to put tampered glass and back cover instantly.
2. Finger print sensor is littel bit slow as compare to other devices and it is also delicate.
3. Camera quality very nice portrait mode works good cutting is gr8. Wide angle also nice
4. About battery normal use just for social media it gose approx 1&amp;1/2 day easily.
By using for gaming plus social media heavy use it give backup approx 1 day. I'm satisfied with this. For charging it takes 2 hours from 0 to 100.

One major issue with this handset is very poor network reception. If you dont leave in centre of a metro city, dont consider buying this.

The  camera issues raised here are not correct.  We have to select 3:4(48MP) mode to get 48 MP images. The images are of really  good quality.
Battery life is quite good as well.
I did notice slight heating on prolonged heavy usage but that I had noticed with my previous  handset(realme2 pro) as well.

Great product feels premium thanks to Samsung bhailog buy Bindas this is an awesome phone with great camera.

I have used oppo,  realme,  xiomi and have observed this is the best deal as display does not stain your eyes as other brand does.

I will add more comments post using for few days.

I use Samsung m30s for one week. Its battery seems to be working like giant which never ends to do work. I like its type of camera, out of three rear cameras 48 mega pixel gives photos of good clarity. Its front camera is also very nice. In night also, camera clicks photo of good quality. I feel proud to have this especially when it just released on e market. Being a prime member I did not get any problem in reaching the mobile over my address. I am amazed from slow video and super slow video taken from this mobile. I took 128 GB Samsung M30S which gives enough internal capacity to store photos, documents etc. On this price, such type of mobile having 6GB RAM, 128 GB ROM, 48 MP Rear Camera and many other application it has not seems costlier.

Hello,
Samsung Galaxy m30s  is a real monster of this era. Talk about its battery life, camera quality,  processor, or its 6.4 sAmoled full display screen.
It runs on Samsung exynos 9611 processor.
It has a 6000 mah battery, I've been using this phone for 2 weeks and I can tell you that, this phone can easily work for 2 days w/o overuse.
Its battery backup is really  impressive.
It has got triple camera setup with 48MP+8MP+5MP. And it 48MP I real 48MP, this phone is a pro in capturing amazing  pictures.
However the fingerprint sensor could be little more faster but it works accurately.
I personally suggest that this phone in this price range is a monster.

On paper, this phone looks blockbuster but falls flat when it comes to actual usage.
The battery life is pathetic for the claimed 6000mAh. I've to keep the phone on charging the whole day and its still never enough charged. Definitely being duped on the pretence of mammoth battery.

The charger is of low quality, just doesn't fit the charging point of phone and is very loose. The phone lags when put on charging, which is essentially all the time due to terrible battery.

The back panel is glossy AF and almost every touch leaves a mark/scratch.

This on paper beast leaves a lot to be desired.

Verdict : AVOID

As per configurations...it is below par....nothing is good in it.Camera as usual in any other handset of Samsung. Battery is for only name u need to charge everyday.
So overall in the name  of camera and battery.. samsung is making good money.
Plz go to some other brand.

Before i am using mi note 4 which 4000 mhz battery.
1.  M30s has 6000mhz . But feels same backup time.
2. Fingerprint sensors is 5x slower then mi note 4.

3. My old mobile samsung galaxy S5 has 16mp camera. M30s 48mp  but result is same. + m30s has extra features like slo mo , wide image , stabilizers etc .

4. Processor feels slow compared to mi note 4 . May be because samsumg have some overloaded os then miui.

5. Superb mobile in this range from Samsung

6. Speakers,  sound , mic , dispay , front camera is awesome.

The Display and Camera in daylight are the main features of this phone. I've been using the phone since 2 months now and have been very much satisfied so far. In this budget segment, Samsung has really outclassed the other brands. Some other praiseworthy features are attractive wide angle clicks, quick fingerprint reader, really accurate adaptive brightness, one-hand use friendly UI, strong build quality (had dropped from an appreciable height and the display was intact) and audible sound even in open areas. Two of my concerns are low quality images at night and Fast charging is not that fast. It takes almost 2 hours for a full charge but given its battery size as 6000, it makes sense a bit.

If you are looking for a budget smartphone then this is for you(with big battery backup) .

Few things that I love about this phone -
1)  Amoled display : great viewing experience
2)  6gb of ram : capable of handling quite heavily
  duty application
3) 6000mAh battery backup

A few things which are just good/average -
1) fingerprint is just a tad slow. You will realize it after a fair amount of usage. But it is not that bad.
2) it has a decent camera . If you are an average phone user it won't concern you much.
3) it takes about 2-3 hours considering it has 6000mAh battery

Samsung cheated all customers. 6000 mah battery was only advertising purpose. Battery backup was 15 hrs for moderate users. Camera quality: Best in outdoor with natural lighting. Average in indoor lighting. Poor in low light.
Display: One of the major highlight is display. Its was top notch.
Samsung One UI: Simply Superb.

Very disappointing with battery performance.

Impovment has been seen over year by samsung in term features in midrange sagment
Which was given in flagship mobile by samsung has been now made available in pocket freindly phones.
However in terms build quality the older midranger of samsung was quite better.
As far as the processor is concern for normal usage its hardly matter weather its SD 710 or Exynos processor.
I believe its mixed bag to offer somthing for all but the gamer.

At first I thought the phone was going to be okay as Samsung was new to this segment of budget phones but Samsung has nailed it . I've been using the m30s for over a month now and I didn't find any area where Samsung has compromised except for the body .
The photo quality , battery life, display (obvious) , performance everything is great except for a bit of a lag while multitasking i.e when u need to switch between a game and other apps and vice versa apart from this everything else is great.
I feel it's a great deal for this price.

Screen-Super amoled is superb
Battery-6000mah is good for 2days
Ram and Rom-4gb /64gb is good for daily use. And casual gaming
Processor-Good for daily use and gaming
Camera-Good in daylight condition but needs improvement in night photography. Overall camera still needs good improvement if compared with other phones camera in same price bracket. phones with less price give better output than this.

Fimgersensor-quick n responsive. Lots of other use of sensor as well

UI- lots of features and gestures introduced in one ui.

Build and weight-Build is decent. Back cover is necessary which is missing in the phone box. Weight is very good and doesn't seem too heavy for 6000mah battery.

If you want to buy a mobile for calling purpose then Please Don't Go for it. You will face huge network problem in this device.

Overall satisfied with it's battery life.
Many times the fingerprint sensor is not responding.
Screen sensitivity is also not up to the mark.
After clicking pic at 48 MP, it take approx. 5 seconds in saving the image.
Forget about playing any game on this. Game starts lagging only after playing for 5-10 mins.
Sound quality is also not very impressive.
Battery charging is also very slow it take more than 3 and half hours for full charge.

Samsung Galaxy M30s is my first buy on Amazon exclusive sale and I'm extremely happy about the product received and the way it delivered exactly 15 days of using this phone and totally agree with Samsung's taglines of Monster Battery- 2 days battery life on full usage. Monster Camera loved the pictures taken through this phone and Monster Display watched HD flicks on prime and netflix at highest quality....Handling and usage wise its totally good and last but not at all the least price. At 14k Samsung M30s is giving Big mobile manufacturing giants an incredibly tough competition.....Overall I recommend this phone to buyers who wants a smartphone for not showing off but to serve the actual purpose of a SMART phone....

All the features are very good , the only thing is when I tried to charge (inserted usb into mobile phone) it didn't got inserted . That's why I talked with Amazon customer and thanks to Amazon they agreed to return my order and will refund. Again I ordered same mobile phone and let's hope it doesn't have any issue.

Battery backup is really good, and also the sAmoled display quality is very excellent.
Other than that nothing in the phone in terms of camera, ram management, sound quality is ok,
16-24mp camera could have provided with good quality, this 48mp quality is really very poor, does not even have 5mp quality, and I observed the range is not so good, antenna quality also lacks in phone.

Amazing and terrific product within the budget...finger print is too gud and quick the main plus point is battery life haven't charged the mobile for 3 days but still the battery is good enough and ram support is super especially for game lovers.camera is excellent with many features like ultra wide angle picture quality and super slow motion videos with high resolution. The most lovely thing is display which is a super AmoLED display which is great features for watching movies with high resolution. Smart gestures and sensors working is also gud...finally special thanks to amazon for bringing DIWALI sale terrific purchase of M30s 6GB ram @12k...

Advantages :
Phone has very strong built-in features like 6 GB RAM, Super AMOLED display, 128 GB Memory, 6000 mAH Battery.
Camera front &amp; back photos &amp; selfies are very good. Sound recording is good &amp; charging is fast with superior battery performance. Slow motion videos are amazing.

Few setbacks :
Device is little bulky due to large battery which automatically minimizes the network signal receiving during the night, and it activates in the morning after some activity. Camera provide erroneous location coordinates. Heavy video &amp; image file sizes are produced, which require conversion to lower sizes.

Battery life is good. Once it is fully charged it works for almost 36 hours. I like the sea green blue back cover.  The camera with its wide angle captures good pics. All in all a good deal. Earlier had issues with my buttery which Amazon replaced within a week and gave me a new handset

The phone literally has a monster battery as is claimed by Samsung. With a single full charge it can last for almost 2 days with mild usage of the phone.
The camera quality is good but at night the pictures are a bit grainy. The wide angle shots are perfect to capture great moments with your friends.
The only disappointment in the phone is its fingerprint scanner which doesn't recognize the fingerprint if your scanner is even a little bit dirty.
The phone comes with a standard type C charging cable and no earphones are provided as is the latest trend with many smartphones.
Overall,this is one of the best phones that you can buy in the sub-15000 price range.

I am using this mobile for 2 months now and the experience with this mobile excellent.  I used to get lot of calls to my mobile as per my profession and talk time is very high which cannot be handled by my earlier mobile Moto M as the battery drains within 3 to 4 Hrs. With the Monster battery in my new Samsung M30, I am charging the mobile once in two days. and never shut down due to low battery.  The photo quality with 48MP Camera is too good.  The Videos created with Slow Motion and Super Slow motion are really enjoyable. My overall experience with this mobile is too good and I keep recommending others to buy this mobile.

This is by far the worst product I've used till date.
For the price of ₹14000, the camera is cheap and  48 megapixle worst than 5 megapixle camera. The 4 gb ram hangs a lot. You cannot play even Pubg smoothly. And built quality is poor, cheap plastic used.

Got it at a good price during first sale.
Battery Backup is good enough - 2 days
Camera is decent. Could have been better.
OS is good - one UI has some good features
Design and Build is average. Plastic is very thin but again, cases are mandatory anyways.
Screen is great and brightness and colors are great.
Fingerprint reader is Okaish, does the Job and face unlock is good.
All in all, a good budget phone, No regrets. A good choice

An all rounder smartphone with excellent battery life and smooth processing.
It's been almost a month I bought the opal black variant for my mother and she is overall happy with the look, feel and working of the phone.
Both the cameras (front and rear) are also providing clear photographs. The 48 mp is handled in the software and still it is giving crystal clear pics.
Sound quality is also superb.
Overall it is a nice buy for anybody looking for all the features of a smartphone under budget.

I bought the phone without a second thought and I think it's really amazing and I'm one of the very first customers to order this phone, its definitely nothing less than a premium phone in terms of everything and it comes in such a low price, worth every penny. I'd suggest everyone to go for it without having a second thought cuz you're not gonna have any regrets. The fingerprint reader is like a premium phone one which reads within micro seconds without any difficulty,  the camera quality is truly amazing and realistic, I unlocked my phone with face unlock in the dark and it read my face in milli seconds and that really made me very happy. The battery life is truly inspiring as it packs a 6000mah battery and it lasts up to 2 days on heavy usage like gaming and binge watching videos. Would suggest you to go for it. Loving the premium look and feel and performance of the phone. Best in segment.  Samsung has gone above and beyond this time. Truly inspirational ❤

No doubt a quality product of Samsung. Being an previous Samsung flagship (galaxy s2, note 3 user) I have never imagined the budget smartphone from Samsung which has got amazing performance and flagship looking gorgeous screen. Battery, camera, needs improvement. Call quality,  signal reception is excellent getting amazing speeds on Vodafone 4g, idea 3g. To my shock jio internet speed is extremely slow on m30s. Hope Samsung pushes update to get it rectified. Although a good product &amp; am enjoying it.

Great phone.
What I like - amoled screen, feels great in the hand..It doesn't feel bulky even with a big battery..processor handles multiple applications well.
I really love some of the Samsung features around day night and light off settings ..and quality of phone build is unparalleled

What can be improved - while the camera is great..with the current specs camera quality could be easily upped..might get some software updates to make it more crisper...

Only con for me is that The volume buttons are on the right...a little but tricky to reach sometimes when you hold phone with one hand

Overall a great phone at a great price..and much better than any other phone In this market segment

I purchased this product mainly for the below reasons and the product works as expected and super happy :
1) Battery life.
2) super AMOLED display.
3) 1-year free warranty on screen.
4) Camara is also good.
5) Phone volume is loud and clear, good for elderly people
6) Not a Chinese product.
yes, the last point is super important if you are looking for reliability and quality.
I used an MI phone prior to this, their support centers really pathetic.

As usual first quality sold by Amazon..Excellent build quality though the phone back panel made of plastic...the phone is really fulfil your needs and it can give good fight to top end phones..
Phone battery- normal usage stays for 2 days,with some game stays for 1.7 days.
Camera quality- excellent quality at this price point.
Processor- I don't feel any lag when playing high end games it feels strong and no heating problems.
Display- Amoled display is super package with this mid range
Overall - The phone can satisfy all your needs..according to my view... I can give 9.5 out of 10.

Gui is impressive, sound has improved much and camera is too good. Great finish better than any other cell in this range...great product, preety surprised to get this cheap, i used Mi 6, but this is better in all aspects. Browsing is effortless with no lag as is gaming. Must buy.

This is a great phone if you want to buy a samsung phone. The display and battery is great. And the user interface is awesome. Built quality is a little drawback
 If you are an mi user than you may face a little problem with the features. Mi has a lot of features. But it doesn't have adds in the ui. So thats a plus point. Camera is okay . Not a fan of camera.

I bought 3 of this device: why?

after I bought one, I found that the battery is very convenient ( it last up to 3 days with my normal use). screen is awesome and bright as I like it. camera is ok, but I have dslr for a better quality, so I don't care, it just captures images ( to be honest). and the price is 14k which I couldn't find any other phone with these specs;the specs that I actually use in daily life not only on paper. one more thing, when I want to resell it after one year bcs of technology advancement in mobile phones, I don't loose a lot of money. cheers.

Battery and camera isn't as expected when you hear the big figures as 6000 and 48 yet better than a few other devices in this range (I compared with Samsung galaxy A9 and other oppo device) it's better than them.

Display isn't really sAmoled. Back look isn't that good, however, front look gives premium feel.

Phone is not heavy. Weight distribution is amazing.

Smooth and fast. (I personally recommend not to use screen guard, it doesn't give you the feeling of edge).

Overall excellent. Go for it.

I'm not the one to write reviwes but I had to come here and say this. First of all, let me tell you about the excellent delivery experience with Amazon. They're truly the best and the fastest. I ordered at 9pm and it came by 12pm, the next day. Great camera, battery life, . Looks good in hand. I own a Vivo phone, It has a lot similar features but i bought this one at a really low price. My mom loved it. She's not into touchscreen phones but she loved this one as it was so easy to operate. So happy. My mom watches YouTube videos all day and the battery is great so she doesn't need to charge it all the time. Really satisfied with the product and with Amazon ofc. Thank you for making my mom smile. Best product.

The product i got having some issues like lagging even in normal use, Call quality is not good. Network is dropping suddenly even in high network area. Sometimes not able to get signals even on multiple restarts.
Coming to positive side..
Display is good, Camera quality is good in daylight. Battery is the plus point but takes 2.5 hrs to fully charge.
Overall its good choice in this price range.
Applied for replacement but no proper response..

Its all just hype "the 6000 mh battery"  its not 6000 mh at all. The battery is like 3000 mh . And fingerpeint and canera both not up to the mark . Performance is decent not that good . Built quality is very poor . You can hear crackling sound by pressing the back. Overall its a ok ok product

In This Budget Its A Awesome piece Guys.
But Yes..I would like to share my thoughts in pros and cons ..
Pros
1. Huge Massive Battery with long lasting performance.
2. Perfect Weight balance and feels pretty handy.
3. Processor is quite Good no problem with that..
Cons.
1. The 48 MP shooter Could have been more optimized. No doubts Photo quality is good but I got some lag on that.
2. Some times I felt the Handset get heated while charging ..but not too much..
3. For Pro Gamers Its not actually the Phone guys...For gamer like me Its awesome .
 I personally Feel That Samsung will fix the camera stability very soon in the next upcoming updates.
Thanks 😊

The product is really  worth to the value and that too from a premium  brand. The battery  is undoubtedly monstrous which relieves you from day to day charging and quite helpful for frequent travelers. Camera quality is also quite decent. There is no heating issue even after continuously using it for several hours. Watching videos in amoled screen gives great feeling. Further reading in eye car mode is eye pleasing.
  Despite all these pros, the one cons you can observe is of built quality. Samsung has compromised  in the body frame of the product in comparison to many of its own products in similar  budgets wherein it provided metallic body frame. The finger print censor could also be on screen rather being on back.

This is the Best Phone Under 14000 budget. It has the massive 6000 mah Battery which will last for minimum 1 day if you do heavy use. Unlike M30 It has the Brand New Exynos 9611 Processor Which is very good and can be compared to Snapdragon 720. You Can Also Enjoy Playing Pubg without any lags with Full Graphics. And the 48Mp Rear Camera is Awesome. And We all Know Sansung has the best display Of all smartphones. This device is no different. The Experience with the Super Amoled Display is Awesome. Also In this Phone We can record 4k Video Recording, it also supports Super Steady video mode and Super Slow Motion. And it also supports Dolby Atmos. Overall The Experience With This Must-BuyPhone Is Awesome❤❤❤

Using the phone for about 20 days after Realme 1...bought with net cost of Rs.14.5 k.. 10% cashback + rs 1000 cashback on amazon pay..my review is as below...as i dont play games, the review dont include that aspect...
Pros:
1. Excellent battery life..
2. Excellent Display (Samsung has one of the best)
3. Camera quality is good (depends on expectation)
4.Night mode across several system apps like ph keypad, msg, default browser etc..
5. Premium looks (although plastic body)
Cons:
1.Face recognition  little slow compared to even Realme 1.
2. For sharing camera pics to whts app realme UI is better..
Hope it will be helpful for taking ur decision..

After using this phone for a week.....i can say the phone has a lot much caliber to outperforn in every aspect .......just the phone lacks with only one of its problem.....and that i would say that samsung  has this problem if you buy a low budget phone in samsung and that is its camera quality...it is said its 48megapixels but it tears it self after 24 to 32 megapixels....grainy photos...
Samsung has a best quality of camera and performance only in it's high budgeted phones only ....rest the m30s samsung galaxy is a must go for phones who like samsung UI
Otherwise for camera lovers they can go for A3 it has sony lendes in it but its heavy too much

got the order delivered in one day . my first impressions is great phone looks premium and interface is also good. battery and camera performance need to check for some time. touch is very good. display is awesome and sound quality is super over headphones. over all nice product by Samsung under 14000.

updated review after one week.
battery backup is not that much when considering it has 6000 mah battery.Other 4000 mah phones giving more battery backup than this. camera quality is not very good. it is ok ok. not upto the mark. so my openion is this phone is good on papers but fails to deliver what ever was hyped about it i.e. battery and camera.

The delivery from Amazon was blazing fast
In love with the phone and touch quality
In 14,300 I got 6GB with 128 GB Rom which is incredible

My fascination with the camera is yet to sprout though
I haven't got enough time to use it properly though but have filled it up with apps

Zero lag so far, I have installed 9 apps for tech news alone.

Camera- 9.5/10
Screen- 10/10
Audio/Video - 9/10
Screen width - 10/10
Love you Samsung for this beauty

Purchased in nov 2019 and charger not working  within  1 month and when u contact the online team they provide some stupid call centre number which you waste half of your life pressing all digits available on your phone

Weak receptors there is always network issue , charging jack is also different  which is not adaptable by other chargers

Good specs at reasonable price from reputed brand Samsung. Best battery of 6000mAh is a monster in itself. 6GB, 128 GB version @ 17k is good considering SBI 10% discount in Amazon Sale.  Best buy is Rs 15300 for 6/128 gb.
Crisp display, fast speed, good battery, multitask n performance r pros.
Can't see any cons in 1 day of usage.

Thanks Amazon for Rs 1000 amazon pay cashback for 1 day sale was a cherry topping. Effective price 14300 is awesome.
Thanks Samsung
Thanks Amazon

This is an amazing product by samsung and the processor is too good and better than previous models. It is amazing that samsung has put a 6000mAh battery inside such a slim device. I have played Pubg which is one of the laggy games in history of mobile gaming and this device has completly destroyed that myth. I can play Pubg for like 5 hours and 45 min without lag from full charge. It is a complete monster in this price range. Talking about camera. Like it is Insane. It can take amazing pics but I feels like the camera soften the photos too much. But all total the camera is Insane. The fingerprint sensor is not tooooo good but u can say it is too good and fast.
I have a great experience with this device.

Really a great phone at avery good price .some times the fingerprint reader is a bit buggy  but overall its a great phone with great camera( you have to customize to high camera features) .For Pubg it runs it on HD and UHD both on high no lag no FPS drops at all only con is that u have to be very carefull while holding the phone cause if it falls in a bad position some serious damage can be done to it .

- Please don't buy the mobile
-Mobile is getting Lag
-Nothing is good in this mobile everything is worst.
-While playing game it's getting hanged, battery is draining in 24 hours with the use of just half an hour use of Internet daily, they are just telling that about the battery
-Network capturing capacity is very less.
-Also the WIFI capturing capacity is totoo less.

The m30s a smartphone which is known as Battery monster is not limited just for battery,
Its processor is good as snapdragon 660...
Some minor lag in the u.i is visible
Not heating at all but  i wish it had atleast snapdragon 710 or 712
And camera is decent as always, especially the steady video mode is fantastic...
Go for it , only if you want good battrylife and amoled display other wise the redmi note 8 pro is a win

I didn't have any plan to buy this phone (Samsung M30s) but also wanted to go for a much trusted brand  so thought why not give M30s a shot. Samsung M series is a most hyped one as it is launched for the millenials and trust me this phone doesn't dissapoint.
* Its Battery life is too good just as the tagline mentions Go Monstrous.
*It has a Super AmoledDisplay .
*It has triple Rear Camera with the main sensor being 48 mp. The Camera will provide you with decent photographs not too good.
*Fingerprint Sensor and Face recognition are super fast.
To conclude Its the best phone one could get their hands on under the 15000budget. I bought it for 12600 under the Great Indian Sale thanksto Amazon for that.

The phone works very smooth...means the power of 4GB ram is observable.
The 45 pixel rear camera clicks very fine moments. Selfie is also nice with this phone.
The phone is very handy means that nice feeling and comfort to hold the phone without any fear of slipping from hand. The grip is nice. The body is shiny and the corners curve are very elegant.
I love the white colour and it is looking very elegant.
The battery gets easily charged within minutes and the monster battery is given of 6000mAh rating, which is plus point.
And nice to have a made in India phone. It also gives me a positive vibe.

Let me start by saying that this phone is worth every penny I have spent on it. Amazing battery life, fast response and great camera performance.

To be honest I did not expect much from this phone apart from battery performance but pictures are impressive from a phone that cost so reasonable.

Phones battery lasts 2 days with moderate use.
Gaming is also decent. One can play graphic intensive games like PUBG, etc.

I suggest this phone to every power user who has tight budget but also needs great camera quality.

Five star rating

First of all i request you all please do not buy mobile from amazon. I got my mobile in time but it has some issues like heating quickly, hanging problem , so with in 2-3 days i wanted to return it but amazon claimed that their was no such problem in that set without examining it and cancelled my return.  That was hilarious!
Secondly when it comes to review the mobile honestly if u want baterry back up u can go with it, but It cannot compete with other brands in its segment in performance.  But lastly its a good choice rather buying any vivo oppo mi realme chinese brand

Phone battery is super. But in case of camera 45mp we actually not getting a 45mp pics. This time I am disappointed with Samsung camera. processor is also good. i will give
2/5 to camera
5/5 to battery
4/5 to processor
5/5 face unlock
Face unlock is quick as well as it works in night too

Best in it's category and price range..

Monster battery with Samsung's one UI and better exonys processor gives amazing power backup...

Other checked boxes:
AMOLED "Samsung" display
Audio jack + inbuilt Dolby atmos
3+1 samsung rear and front camera setup
Expandable memory (2+1 slots)
Type c + 15w fast charging
Premium design (particular in this color - opal black , you won't miss glass back)

Things you are not getting in box
Earphones, screen protectors and back case - minor things not deal breakers

I just bought 2 of these phones there are 99% pros and 1%cons...so i will surely recommend you guys to buy this phone this is the best you can get at this price range...it is very smooth no lag at all and also great gaming device..its just a little slippery at back so i recommmend buying some back or flip covers from amazon(vast choice)...all in all WORTH BUYING

The phone runs smoothly with 4x2.3 GHz Cortex-A73 &amp; 4x1.7 GHz Cortex-A53, Octacore processor even while playing high-end games. The 6.4 inches 411 PPI density Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen offers great movie and gaming experience. The audio quality is quite good with just above average loudness. The Triple Camera setup provides crisp images in the broad daylight.  The 8 MP ultrawide camera helps capture wider area which has slight blurs at the edges. The selfie camera is just above average. Pixels in the night mode don't turn up that clear. The fingerprint sensor is placed slightly higher which takes a bit of effort to reach there.

Overall, an above-average phone in the segment with the given pricing.

Everything on this device like battery backup, screen quality and Full hd streaming on Netflix and amazon prime at this price point is awesome....only thing it needs an update is in video recording in superstability mode. Camera quality i also awesome. Physical fingerprint and face unlock is also very quick.

Trust me it's my genuine feedback, please give me refund I don't want replacement :-(

1. Camera quality is not upto 48M pixel
I'm very much disappointed. As per Samsung instructions I changed it to 48MP, but not improved picture quality.
I compared with Samsung Onmax 13MP vs Samsung M30S 48 MP, I feel that both are same. For doing market Samsung did big mistake.
2. While talking rear speaker vibration.

3. Network issue - calls auto disconnecting and few words not reaching to other persons.

4. Micke issue - In all calls voice deliver its not good, because of this issue I need to speak louder.

Pros
Battery- I am a very heavy user, I'm almost always on my phone. Easily lasted the whole day with enough battery still left.
Camera- I previously used a Lenovo K8 plus which had a dual camera. But this performs much better than in many ways. Selfies come out great as well. Big fan of the wide angle camera.
Overall very smooth, RAM management is great. Call quality was good. UI is good and I was able to uninstall many of the unnecessary apps.
Cons
The back is stylish and feels good but has already got a scratch(minor one) I  think from dust particles on my desk.
Got it in exchange and with all the offers cost me around 9000. Huge bargain. Big cheer to amazon for delivering it within 2 days.

Transferring data from old android phone is real headache..it was quite easy with the previous android phones...it's a major task for me now..if any app is there by samsung it will be helpful..otherwise phone is light weight, display is awesome, and camera quality is good

The only disappointment with this phone is in the camera department, specially the front camera. Coming to performance, software and user experience, this phone really comes ahead and not to forget that gorgeous display...hands down!! I bet no other brand would offer such crisp display at this price. I got this for just 11.5 on during the sale. Battery life is the major selling point of this phone...it is just flawless, easily last 2 days for a moderate user. For a heavy gamer, it can easily last a day. Overall a balanced device for the price. Good Job Samsung!!

Writing it after 2 months of usage

Pros:
1. Look and feel is good. Slim thickness(back cover is plastic kind of material not glass)
2. Rear Camera is really good, gives lot of options eg. Night Mode and all.
3. Battery life after heavy usage (playing  games and) is 1 day, other wise for normal usage it goes upto 2 days.

Cons:
1.Front camera is not so good , beauty options  make it more worst because of it natual colors get lost in the photos.

2. Though it says fast charging, but it takes almost 2 hours to fully charge it.

Fingerprint scanner is good but with no extra options other than main unlock features. 6000 mAh battery is epic failure, drains faster not can withstand for a day for regular use in video watching. Camera is poor in low light conditions. However in daylight camera quality is good. Samsung is dabba phone nothing extra features can be provided by them. Never ever wish to buy Samsung again

Over.all the handset is good in  as economy and daily using purpose. 6000 Mah Battery is highly useful .

For the camera :-  quality of the pictures was good but as my observation it not give 48 MP quality. And also real color tone not reflecting in in the image  ( if HDR is deactivate also). Also need to install 3rd party application to read bar code and QR Code.

In the case of fingure print sensor it is ok. But if it is on screen sensor it will be more comfortable like A50 series phone. One of the negative in this sensor, it is possible to register only 3 figure. If minimum 5 fingure is it good.

- Camera quality is cool.
- Feel good when you handle the device in one hand.
- Touch feeling is new
- Battery life is good(Average counts of calls made per day 10-15calls with 10minutes of talk)
- Charging speed is good when you use the shipped adapter. (We always use random adapter at home). Stay with shipped adapter and cable for improved life.
- Cool one for Gamers.

This phone was suggested by my friend.

Fingure print senser is not as expected senseing is too delay
Camera. Rear Camera  quality is very good but not as real 48 MP camera.
LOW LIGHT VIEW IS NOT SO GOOD
BUT SUFFICIENT LIGHT THE CAMERA QUALITY IS VERY GOOD.
  Front camera is good it's working like as 16MP
Battery life. When continuous internet uses  approx 12 hours or 10 hours
When not use regular internet approx 24 hours.
If you see continuous movie without net time is approx 12 hours
Only calling it goes on approx  72 hours.

So in the end we can say battery is awesome but camera quality and figureprint senser should be  improved.
Thanks guy to read the review.

Great fon for gaming enthusiasts.
Battery life with continuous data/ wifi on and games on lasts for 36  hours.
Takes nearly 100 minutes to get it fully charged.
Fingerprint sensor is great, however in screen could have been better.
Screen resolution is great
Camera quality is fabulous.

Cons
Curved screen could have been better.
No headphones in package is indeed a pooor thing.
Still a long way to beat VIVO, OPPO, MI and REALME.

It's very nice phone with monster batter. Currently using it as a primary mobile. Before this I was samsung s8 user. Fed up with battery performance. Now got this beast. I m giving 7 out of 10 to this mobile. Some basic feature missing in this. Battery easily survive 2 days in basic use.
Below are the reason why I have deducted 1 point.
1.Knox support u can not use samsung secured folder on this phone.
2. Samsung pass also missing in this phone.
3. Slightly heavy due to monster battery. But not too much bulky.

It's an awesome product in this budget... I'm using this product since 3 - 4 months... Frankly speaking, the battery backup is good enough, but not as expectation, it could be slightly efficient about battery... Camera quality awesome I can't explain that how it's possible to serve this kind of camera in this budget... High graphics games are running very smoothly which is more impressive... But,if I play for long time,I feel slightly heating issue...But overall it's a great product by Samsung... Amazon brings this product to me within 24 hrs.  I'm very satisfied to deal this product with Amazon...
Thank you 🙂

Finger print sensor is not working properly in M30s and also rear camera quality is not bad..but main problem is if we take photo and you zoom that photo it is fully blur even it's single zoom...and Samsung exnoys process is very very slow ...and *** heating problem also .. these are major problem...so plz don't buy this photo....only battery backup is good

So using this device from 2 days..
First of all lets talk about the battry man its huge.. my last mobile i had to charge it for at least 2 time a day.. and now m30s runs 1 and half day for me.. iam too heavy user. I watch series, Social media, games, browsing and what not.. and lets talk about the camera i fell camera its very good but in wide angle mode its seem to loos quality we see more grains in the corner of the image.. and the super slow motion is also very good but same it doesn't have much quality..  they should have given more time in super slow motion.. now lets talk about display its super amoled so no doubt.. so over all if you want to buy a good value for money mobile in 13k price range just go for m30s

The phone is absolutely amazing one..loved it.It got really a MONSTER battery,so i dnt even worry about recharging.when watch videos or movies the battery charge didn't  deplete.48mp cam also superb.im in love with the front cam lol.AMOLED display is just another amazing feature.
  The one drawback i felt tht is fingerprint reader.when the phone is using without backcover its difficult to find the reader and sometimes i have to scan three or more time to unlock it.After i bought a backcover for my MONSTER  it bacame more easy. the performance, battery life, display was amazing,not just amazing its super amzing 😍. I love my samsung and i love my M30s MONSTER 😘. Thank you samsung for this wonderful product 💙

First of all, Amazon is excellent for delivering product on time.
1)the look of phone is awesome.
2) Processor is excellent for handling multiple apps at a time. For gaming it is awesome.
3) The battery life is enough. It least for a day or you can say more than a day for medium user, over singal charge. And also it gets charged quickly as it supports fast charging.
4) Camera is good enough. But it gave more saturated images some time. If you expect DSLR like photography it is not of that range. But tha night mode works excellent comparing other phones. Slow Motion &amp; Super Slow Motion is awesome as it catches all the details.
5) Overall the Phone is awesome. Go For It...

I would say this is Samsung's best midrange smartphone. The Exynos processor is very reliable and efficient. The M30 has super amoled full HD display with a 6.4inch screen which gives the smartphone amazing display. The smartphone comes with a bunch of amazing features a fast fingerprint unlock, face unlock, Dolby support, an outstanding  triple rear camera and the best part about this phone is its battery  life it's simply the best. Even after heavy usage and multitasking  the battery hardly drains. According  to me there is no other phone in any segment of smartphones that could give M30 any competition  when it comes to battery. Overall a complete  package  phone

Delivery within 24 Hours I'm using this for last  6 days, This is the best product for mid range user.Super AMOLED display gives you the best image view.Waterdrop notch was amazing, looks very beautiful.Triple rare camera with 48+ 8+ 5 MP with wide angle and depth Sensor was best in this phone.Front 16 MP selfie camera was amazingly captured photos.Gradtion colour gives the best look &amp; the big screen, best thing is it has 6000 mah battery power.Processor was good. No heating problems are there, but while charging the phone was slightly heated. The phone is upgradeable.Samsung apps was working amazing like music player, device care, s secure was amazing.

This set boasts an enormous battery life and based on my experience it has every right to do so. 6000mah is more than what you can expect and if you have exquisite features you might as well have the time to use them. Apart from this the camera quality is more than awesome in the 48mp click and videos are just as awesome. The third biggest feature on this set is its s-amoled screen on which you frankly will not be disappointed.  Its not much heavy in terms of processor power but with 6gb ram you kind of neglect such issue especially if you are not a hardcore gamer. All and all this is for me the best you can get in this range in terms of a whole package.(especially if you are enthusiastic photographer)

It's an amzing phone in mid-range segment, with excellent features like OLED display, 6000mah etc.

Conc.
1) it's software are not better optimized.
2) camera can be improved because low light fearure is.
  of no use, and captures very less light.
3) it doesn't have indisplay fingerprint.
4) samsung should start providing case alongwith
  phones.
5) no gorilla glass protection.
6) polycarobnate body.
7) not an snapdragon processor.(weakest pont at all)

Pathetic product... extremely delicate... buggy phone... samsung has compromised on the quality of the product to reduce the cost... my phone screen got cracked within 3 months of use only and the screen center label it as accidental damage hence no replacement... paid 4500 to replace it..as you cannot prove that the phone didnt fall down...

V good phone overall though camera quality is not up to the expectations as it claims in the product description, images are blurry as you zoom in a little. Other than camera, battery life is good, at the end of two days after full data on and phone calls on 4G, you will be left with 30% of battery, gaming support is good as of now but not sure after few months of use, since Samsung device performance deteriorates faster compared to other devices.
Overall a good budget phone

Processor:processor is also great and fast,performance  is great,no lag with pubg

Battery:battery easy work for 2-3 days on single full charge

On every aspects this phone is great

I have used a variety of phones in the past that includes Redme, Motorola, OnePlus 3T and iPhone. All those phones have excellent n/w connection at the place I work. All five bars are present on the network strength indicator. M30S has only one 1 bar present and the connectivity is horrible. I was not able to browse with the speed provided by the phone.  I returned and replaced the original from Amazon thinking mine is a defective piece. Both had the same issues. This phone is no good for  Internet/4G. For other purposes, it may be ok.

My device didn't power on even after charging for 6 hours. Reached out to Samsung support and followed the troubleshooting steps which didn't help. I used a different USB cable and voila the device powered on. After few minutes, the original USB cable did work perfectly.

I was never a fan of Samsung or its UI. This device changed my perception. Battery life is amazing. The display is something which blew my mind. UI is clean and free from bloatware. I noticed lags with the FP sensor but should be fixed with software updates.

Battery and display is awesome, voice call is good, found no issues in network reception in terms of calling, it is well optimized. LTE connectivity is average.  4g connectivity is good. Operating system is excellent,  processor is good for day to work. Artificial intelligence optimization works fine and may more improve day by day.
Camera in low light is not good,  in daylight it is good. The best thing is that operating system is well optimized for better performance. In future,  may be expected LTE connectivity and camera performance will optimized through software updates.
Final  words , dependable mobile can surely be purchased for all day to day uses.

I had purchased 2 phones one for me and one for my wife, you can understand how much l liked the phone. I was searching phone with qualities which all available in this. First storage space is 128 GB you don't have to think about if space , RAM is 6GB so no issues with games you play which sometimes has huge RAM requirement. Then selfies camera is also good and all rear cameras also impressive. And who can forget huge battery of 6000 mah.
After using phone from 2 months I must say its the best phone.

Writing a review after using for almost 20 days. I like most is the battery life. For me it goes almost 2 days. With continue usage with internet it will last for more than a day. Rear camera is best for clicking wide angle photos. Also this phone camera has live focus for clicking portrait blue photos.

Design is nice. Infinity u type display provides wide viewing experience.

Touch is excellent.
I compared with other phone networks, I feel Samsung provides excellent phone configuration.

Display is pretty awesome have 4 k ultravideo clarity with no hanging issues.

Overall I like the performance of phone. I will recommend to buy. Go with brand.

This is a very very good product by samsung which stands to its name Monster bcoz even after continuous use of this mobile for playing pubg, streaming videos, songs, etc. Its battery showed that it can still operate for one more day, I just can't believe my eyes..this mobile tops in all aspects be it performance, camera, battery life, video quality which a flagship phone requires...I doubt how come samsung can sell one of it's best products at peanuts price...still have no clue on how its priced...good job Samsung and Amazon.

Awesome phone for the price, it's best value for money budget phone. 6000mah battery last for 2 days for me, which is good but it also take 2.5 hrs to fully charge. Screen is very bright and I like the color reproduction in this phone. It's a massive phone, I quite enjoyed watching movies and playing games. Camera is good too but can't compare with flagship phones. In daylight photos are good but in low light it's not good. But again at this price it's ok. Overall I prefer this phone a lot while traveling. Highly recommend this phone if you're looking for budget phone with good screen and battery.

I have received my M30s almost 2 weeks back. Just started using it fully.

Need immediate resolution to this or exchange of the device...

I got m30s for 11,500 and really it was a good deal. First coming to display, best display in this price range but yeah you have have to keep it safe.
Processor is unbeatable in this segment, pubg runs on hd mode at default. Camera is not as good as i thought but its click decent pictures ( maybe get fixed in future updates). The main higlight of this phone is 6000 mah battery and believe me its amazing. You can play pubg for 10 consecutive hours. And phone gets charged in 2.5 hours which is impressive. If u are a normal user then u dont have to charge your phone for 2 days. Yeah it my favourite device right now in this price range.

The phone looks amazing! I bought a 4GB + 64GB model and I've gotta tell you that under this price this phone seems to be a great deal!

Pro points:
Good camera quality!
Display is nice! (Well... Samsung!!)
Phone isn't so bulky
Fits right in the hands! ( Proper width)
Great processor; games do not lag!
Fast charging us

Cons:
Battery lasts for just one day! Thought it might last more...
The out of the box ui is very laggy and have to update it.
No back cover included...
No earphones included...
Mirroring is a pain to do...

#GoMonster This product is way better than all the phones available in the market at that price range.
For people complaining it doesnt come with a 15W charger, it actually has a 15W charger.It is calculated as follows :- Watts=volts* amp
So its 9V*2A(1.67A to be precise)=15w charger.
Great specs at an affordable price.Wished Samsung included headphones,transparent case and a tempered glass already installed on the screen.Got a battery usage of 2days 3 hours on continuous wifi and aod with video streaming on YouTube at 720p.
Camera is great!

It has a massive 6000mAh battery but when it comes to reality it seems like a 3000mAh battery. Especially majority people opt this phone for battery. This is a big minus for this phone. Coming to performance it is not bad. Camera quality is also not that great. Face recognition and finger print is better. Dont buy this phone if your main choice is battery.

Major disadvantage is that this phone comes without any back cover and screen protector. So, you have to go through online system again for a back cover and a protector. Selecting screen guard/ protector is a major headache. Bcz, if you go through various comments for selecting it, you will be totally confused. Again some companies will sell it as a pair. No idea why you have to buy a pair of screen guard.
But, when we purchased Samsung Galaxy A-30S from a shop, both back cover and the screen guard was provided with the phone.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY THIS MOBLILE BY CONSIDERING CAMERA PLEASE NEGLECT THIS PHONE ,BUT IF U ARE CONSIDERING BATTERY , DISPLAY THEN GO FOR IT .
SPEAKER SOUND IS LOUD ENOUGH.
MOBILE IS LOOKING DELICATE AS BODY IS MADE OF PLASTIC
HAVE A HARD CASE AS REPLACEMENT OF SAMOLED COSTS VERY MUCH WHEN COMPARED TO IPS DISPLAYS AND THIS MOBILE IS NOT HAVING GORRILA GLASS 5 PROTECTION AS GIVEN IN MANY MID RANGE PHONES CHARGER IS 15W GOOD ,BUT EVEN 4000MAH BATTERY MOBILES ARE NOW USING 18 W SO TIME TO TAKE CHARGING WILL BE MORE ,BUT ONCEE THE MOBILE IS CHARGED WE CAN USE IT THROUGH OUT THE DAY WITH HIGH USAGE

Battery is not upto the mark, giving backup like 4000 mAh, so 6000 mAh is just fake advertising tactics.
Camera is also not like 48 Megapixels (I tried all possible settings, and different camera apps, no change).
Fingerprint is super slow, it fails 6 times out of 10 times.
WiFi : You can not use WiFi and WiFi Hotspot simultaneously, this means you cannot use your phone as repeater(Xiaomi phones do this with ease, I was using this feature on Redmi Note 5 Pro).
Display : Display quality is neither good nor bad, means, it plays video well but in day time, brightness is not upto the mark. When using phone in sunlight, you'll feel difficulty.

Best phone if u buy at price of 11600
10% Sbi discount and 1000 amazon pay

Best thing in thing phone is its battery its its really a monster battery with suprisingly no heating while charging and while using it.

Body weight is 188gm but u dont feel its very compact and light weight phone.

Memory available space is shown approx  1.6gb available when u install some apps but dont worry i am using 40 applications other than system application the storage change slightly so dont worry i thing its a bug and Samsung will fix it.

Main and last is its camera
Its really not up to the mark
But its Brand Samsung it will definitely improve it with giving its update..

Samsung have once again focused on battery capacity as one of the highlights. The Galaxy M30s has a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, the biggest I’ve ever seen on any Galaxy phone, no matter which price segment it may fall in. The other notable feature on the M30s is a 48MP primary rear camera. That’s nearly a 5x increase in the megapixel count over the M30 and higher than even the Galaxy A70.

The Galaxy M30s comes with the Exynos 9611 chipset, which seems to be the same as the Galaxy A50’s Exynos 9610. The M30s also gets a design update, mainly in the way the rear cameras and flash module are placed. There’s a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity-U display, 5MP and 8MP depth and ultra-wide rear cameras, a 16MP front camera, 15W fast charging, and a physical rear-facing fingerprint sensor.

It's my first Samsung phone in 15 years of smartphone usage and boy , it has surprised me ! It's an excellent phone with big screen which is not big in hand , marvelous screen with soft touch n vibrant colors.
Performance is very good , I'll spare the technical details but I bought 64 GB n enriched with 64 GB card so win win .
Camera is outstanding especially in this price range . The two pics attached clearly demonstrates the effect of wide angle camera .
Rest are also as per expectations . Overall  , a spectacular package at unbelievable price . Don't envy flagship phones , you can get one at a quarter of price!

After trying all other phones available in market I bought samsung after 6 years
!!samsung is beck!!
Yes its back with nice phone in a budget segment
6000 mah battery is wow after using normally in the day time u save 50 %in the night
I would suggest every one
M30s has all everything of other phone +battery +nice camera+
Only problem I faced is speaker popup screen comes often that might be a sim setting thing
Apart from that forget all the phones available in the market
And buy m 30 s.
I m very much satisfied.

Welcome back samsung for this lovely mobile

Likes:
Looks/ Aesthetics
Battery-life

Neutral:
Face recognition
Fingerprint reader

Dislikes:
Cameras (Both Front &amp; Rear - Not of great Quality, probably because I also have an Galaxy S9)
Display (Does not render 4K/5K/8K videos as per expectations though, unsure about what is great with the Amoled display)
Body does have grip, but the material used is a tacky one (feels like I am pressing buttons everywhere)

Other(s):
Not into gaming, so nothing has been checked on that front.
I am an audiophile, but yet to check for the quality on this purchase.

Happy, since I bought it for the battery-life and as a secondary phone.

Excellent Battery, Amoled display,  disappointed with camera, Real capturing time of image is high need to hold camera study  for sometime after clicking better images,  front camera is ok, whitening in image is higher side sharpness is missing. Front Camera very much disappointed.Overall Good phone in this range

The phone is sleek. The colour gradient is beautiful. The body to screen ratio is amazing. The best features are the 6000mAh battery and 48 MP main camera in rear camera setup. Unlike other Samsung phones, this phone's camera setup is not elevated from the surface. It blends along with the body. The sound system is excellent.

The two facts I didn't like about the phone is that the body is plastic. And as usual, Samsung phones have initial start up issues. This phone is facing it. Sometimes it switches off on it's own and restarts. From previous experience, I know the issue fades as we start using it.

Overall, a good phone for less than15k.

4 for finger print scanner as it's not in screen but it works like a charm. Camera gets 4 since the auto focus response is slow and sometimes results in bad video capture. Battery gets 5, on moderate to heavy usage it lasts 2-3 days. One UI is great, I am enjoying the AOD and the customizations. Love the AMOLED screen. Overall a good phone for non gamers.

I got the phone on 15th Oct and have been already using it for 1 week now. The best thing about the phone is its battery life, I am not a hard gamer but I am very active in social media and play music literally all the time and with this use i see only around 50% depletion in the battery charge and to fully charge for this 50% it takes less than 45 mins which is really fast considering its 6000mAh battery.

Look wise feels very premium.
Slow-mo and  super slow-mo works like a charm.
Only one concern picture quality doesn't seem to be as good as 48 megapixel camera should take.
Otherwise  worth the money.

Pros-
1) The battery is as expected.
2) S amoled display.
3) Fingerprint is fast.
4) Camera is good.
5) Nice UI.

Cons-
1) There is no gorilla glass protection
2) Back side is made up of plastic, looks very cheap, greasy(fingerprints can be seen), not scratch resistant(scratches are easily made). It would be best if you buy a cover with it.
3) Cost cutting can be seen (Receiver has no protection). There is not S secure, samsung pass etc.
4) processor is average. Although pubg can be played in HDR.
5) Auto brightness takes time to adjust.

Overall: Battery cover up all the cons.

Not that great.
The claims of 48MP camera , 6000mAh battery , fast charging don't seem valid ..
Because 48MP camera and front camera looks like mere 5MP camera.
6000mAh battery drains like hell.
Fastcharging doesn't work well .. it has usual 2ampere adapter so charging with it does not provide fast charging.
Graphics are good. Screen resolution is good.
But as I said earlier camera and battery claims by company are utter rubbish. Please dont buy if u r attracted by the futile claims of battery and camera.

There is a problem of network when a network drop a bit,  data stops working.. this is a issue in this smartphone....i hope Samsung will do something about it otherwise this is cheating to save money...Fingerprint is very good but the main camera sensor colours are okay but it can be better in mid range segments... the aperture should be better then it will be the perfect choice for me and i guess for everyone who like Samsung brand... i also do have so many options like realme, redmi, etc but i like the Samsung brand... so i choose this one but as per my expectations main 48mp camera is not up to he mark... but overall phone is very good in performance and specifically battery backup... i am waiting for new update for phone...

The Phone SIM Tray will not close with Memory Card placed in it. Amazon asked me to contact Samsung Service Center which i did and Samsung Tech said the phones motherboard need to be replaced and is currently not in stock. Also, they will charge me as this is an out of warranty repair as the SIM Slot something is physically bent or not proper. For a replacement, if i had bought it from a retailer they would have give me an immediate replacement but since i bought it from Amazon - Amazon needs to replace it. And since the phone is not even activated, should be a definite replacement as this is manufacturing defect. Amazon says this my return window has closed and cant help.

Charging issues in the phone and I'm submit my phone in the service center phagwara they change the charging Jack but it was not working.
Service engineer suggest that You can charge your phone with another normal charger but its take time to charge the Battery. Next day they will change the jack.
Next day when I'm submit my phone they are calling its a liquid damage I can not repair within warranty.
Today they are denie that they did not repair my phone yesterday.
Samsung service center also don't help me.
So I am sujest that never buy sumsung mobile and their services are very Bad.

Probably the best phone under 15000 Budget right now in the market, Killer Specification, and Samsung Brand is an ultimate combo. this is truly a gem of a device. i am reviewing after my 5 days of usages, Super Amoled Display panel is absolutely vivid and natural. The battery is terrific, for a moderate user like me it lasts me around two days. I am truly satisfied with the device and would recommend everyone who is looking for budget device under  15K then surely you should go with us. A big thumbs up to Samsung for working very well on this Phone.

I'm writing this review after 45 days of using this device
Everything in this phone is good if you look at the price tag
Pubg runs smoothly, camera a excellent, display is so good
But built quality is one disadvantage
This doesn't mean that the device looks cheap, device looks pretty good but I accidentally dropped it from my study chair and it got a crack in screen which cost me 4500 I mean a chairs isn't that high that it can cause such damage of course it is the bad built quality but it is a good device if yoh look at price and specifications

There is no point rating this mobile M30s below 5. I am using this mobile since October 13, 2019. It is indeed added with all necessary features which are very helpful in all ways. Cannot comment on the battery powered with 6000mah because it is awsm. Display is crystal clear. The phone is very handy to use this it is excellent phone to use. To ensure long life to your ph you must use a backcover &amp; a screenguard which will cost you around (approx) 150/- &amp; 100/- respectively.

Excellent bet. Value for money. Awesome Amoled fully HD display. Camera is Superb. I liked it because of Brand, Quality and Price.  Not to forget the Cash back received from Amazon and SBI card, overnight delivery which makes a good package deal altogether. Go for it u wont be even slightly disappointed.

Specially the battery is awesome it last for 2 days

Camera is also awesome

Overall it's a great phone considering its price because of it's S amoled FHD+ display and a really long battery life given it's 6000mah battery which honestly should make the phone look thick and bulgy but that's not the case ... The phone's a little bit heavier due to it's big battery .
Camera quality is decent on both the cameras and the thing I liked the most is it's Exynos 9611 octa core processor which multitasks like a pro with primary clock speed upto 2.3 GHz so that's really good.. I'm happy with it's performance and recommend buying if you're not a big camera enthusiast and if you are then go for the A series A50s or A70s.

If your need is amazing battery backup, display, performance, smooth UI go for it. If your main focus is on camera...it's not good at all.

From battery standpoint for me it's giving around 30hrs with full 4g internet on and  bit of gaming and videos.. haven't faced any kind of heating issues or performance lags yet.

All is best other than camera....it's a huge disappointment my earlier mobile lemax 2 is far better than this in terms of sharpness and picture quality, 48 mp doesn't work like one.. apart from that...all is well

My main focus was on battery and performance so...it's the best u can get

In this price point this mobile is just a beast
The points which highlights the phone to a beast :
1. 6000 mAh battery which gives a massive response at least 1.5 days
2. 48 MP camera with ultra wide lens
3. Super Amoled full HD display gives a massive display results
4. With a beautiful sapphire blue colour

The one thing that I notice that the sound quality in speaker is not up to the mark

I was continuosly using MI products so i vecame bore with same old features and style then i decided to move towards samsung. When M30 was launched i wanted to buy that but could not buy but when m30S came with better features specially with 6000 mah battery i couldn't resist myself even though i had bought my last phone 6 ms ago i went for Samsumg M30S. I certainly didn't regret at all the processor, the camera 48 mp, the videos and the sound quality are one of the prime features. I am in love with phone.

I've gifted this to my sister despite my apprehension about Samsung's notoriously fragile screens. Luckily, there is a 1-year screen protection guarantee, so this concern seems settled for now.
Apart from that, I considered the available options for me and found this to offer many more features at lesser price in comparison. In other words, this phone seems quite promising - let's see how well it stands its use!

Conclusion: If you have a budget of 10-15 K, I'd say this is a pretty good option to give a try.

The  best feature  is as mentioned  6000mah battery .I can easily use 1day to 1and half days in a single charge.( also it provides power saving mode ). Charging it take 2 hours. Camera is perfect in outdoor but indoor low light conditions not upto the mark and front  facing  camera being  16mp not that good for any selfie  lovers orelse its ok.
No heating issues experienced  yet design and weight distribution  is perfect, u don't  even think u got a 6000mah battery. Display top class , premium  look , good touch response. Gaming  performance  i don't  know because i don't  play  any games .As for me am satisfied  with the phone and the price range (4gb variant). Truely a #monster by #SAMSUNG.

Pros
Amazing battery life even with heavy usage i end the day with almost 45% remaining.
The display is flagship grade and provides great colour and movie watching experience.
Slim bezels and One UI is just fast and snappy.
This phone handles heavy games really well, PUBG runs at smooth+extreme or hdr=high framerate.
Rear camera captures good photos (you can use gcam for even better results) wide angle is really useful.
Dolby atmos for great movie watching experience.

Cons
A not so great selfie camera
Battery takes almost 2 hrs to charge fully but its reasonable for a phone with 6000mah

I got delivery of my m30s on 03 Oct and on 20 Nov the display gone bad.. only blue lines at bottom.. approached service centre for repair ... they told no warranty for display ...when I contented..then they tried their best to put blame on me by saying that display damage due to impact.. since three is no scratch or breakage I told them to prove that phone is subjected to impact.. no response they have only one word to say impact damage no warranty samsung and Amazon plz keep in your mind that this is india and not China..  shri Narendra modi is our prime minister ... you will be made accountable...

Overall satisfied with product.

1)Battery is excellent. Covers almost 36-40 hrs if usage is less.
2) Product comes with 48 megapixel rear camera and I clicked few images for your reference. Satisfied with camera quality.
3) Super amoLed display quality is good and display touch is excellent.
4) I have not experienced any slowness while using multiple applications at same time.

Cons:
1) Majorly Disappointed because product takes 2 hours 30 min to charge completely.
This product must be support atleast 18v -20v charger.
In daily basis we cant wait such long hours to charge device fully.
2) During calls I experienced voice is low and unclear sometimes.

Pros:
1. Looks nice.
2. Battery is also powerful.
3. Fast charging.
4. Samsung brand

Cons:
1. Samsung claims primary camera is 48MP but it is not up to the mark. Look like 8MP. So noisy pictures.
2. 16MP Front camera is worst.
3. Speaker sound is not loud.

In this price range, anyone can get better phone with better build quality, camera and performance in this price range in other brands.

Samsung look into this, just writing on paper will not give you output, you have to work on it.

Expectations were high with this phone. Camera quality should be better.
Hopefully  they will make it by software update.

The phone which I received in first place had a faulty battery charger and stopped working. The phones battery is not charging for hours.requested to replace the phone. On my request the phone was replaced. At the time of receiving the delivery opened the package and removed the phone in front of delivery man and the phone was defected. He himself was laughing and was amused at the situation. I handed a faulty phone to receive a defected one.
I have been very disappointed,angry, frustrated and tired of this purchase.

Amazon is going from bad to worse with their service and I can't trust the originality of the products which they have to offer.

I was very confuse befor purchasing M30s beacuse in same price range mi note7 pro was available.
But i trust on samsung brand and ordered this mobile. When i recieved it then i compared  with Mi note 7 pro camera, display, and sound and found samsung m30s far better then Mi Note 7 pro. Also i compared night camera view with realmeXT and again found M30s Better.

Bluetooth connectivity is awsome.

Awsome picture quality

If i talked about Battery Life - Easily you can spend 2 days after charged it once.
This phone doesn't have any haeting issue

Figerprint works very nice.

Recommend to all of you please go for it.

Faster delivery by Amazon, thanks.
Battery is Decent, Screen resolution and overall feeling is OK.
Don't know how to use fingerprint sensor for screen unlock. Camera is below average considering Samsung brand. Cheap quality body material.
Worst thing, not about product but Amazon, is that why they don't allow telephonic interaction with customer care. Really pathetic. I wanted to know details about promotional offers, but was helpless.
Overall average product by Samsung standard.

Battery life very good, not need to carry charger

Display HD Amoled, best for dark themes lovers

Sounds quality very good though bluetooth devices Dolby sound

Camera quality 48 megapixel is very good in this range,

4GB ram, 64 GB memory, octocore processor best in this range

All this in Samsung brand,

Overall I'm happy with this.

My call audio quality is pathetic. I initially thought it is because of my network but later found the phone is not good with any network. Need to check with service center if it is a speaker issue. Just 10 days old and i have to do all these stuff. Wouldn't recommend this phone o anyone

Pro's:-
Fingerprint &amp; face detection  are super fast &amp; even in low light face detection works good.
Camer quality is good but front camer is not upto the expectations .
Display &amp;  screen resolution is pretty  good ,really  loved it.
Performance  is good and very soothing.
Battery doesn't run out easily  &amp; easy to charge, it charges upto 25 percent within 30 minutes &amp; takes 2 ½ hours for full charge.
Con's:-
Back panel looks kinda good but as it is plastic it is easy to get damaged &amp; not at all scratch resistant .
They didn't  provided  back case &amp; headset.
Its durability  is poor .
 OVERALL  THE BEST PHONE AT THIS PRICE RANGE...

Worst phone ever bought in my whole life. Got it delivered on 23-Nov-2019. On 10-Dec-2019 started facing issues like battery overheating while my phone was not charging, loudspeaker not working, phone hanging, apps crashing etc. Went to service center to get it changed they said needs to be done within 14 days as per the policy but nowhere mentioned in the booklet provided. They kept phone for 2 days and than don't know what they did and returned the phone. Again same issues. Reported to company for the same issue still not rectified. Personal suggestions Don't buy samsung low end phones below 25000 INR

Phone is good considering the price point. I got defective piece first then I have to replace it , to experience was not that great for me. Phone heats up quite a bit while doing heavy tasks and playing games. Battery life is good cameras are better than I expected speaker and microphone quality are above average average charging speed considering the huge battery.
Overall my conclusion: this is one of the best phone you can get under this price bracket and Samsung one UI is icing on the cake.

I was able to read the texts of images from 10 or camera but not from m30s. Both was clicked from Same place in same light conditions

I have been using the samsung M30S for approximately 3 months now. The battery is "actually" a monster, easily lasts 2 days with average use. The camera quality is excellent. The fingerprint reader is not as sharp/fast when compared to my earlier MI phone. The screen is superb with sharp colors and good contrast. Hardly any lag noticed. For the price its totally worth. So if you are looking for a phone in the 15000 range, this should be your first choice. Good job Samsung!

Think before you buy

Not 4G compitable guys
I did not notice that
And on &amp; off button takes too long to work sometime it just don't switch on

I am changing my star  M30 Star rating from 4 to 2 now
Its a King phone just for the battery backup  Super Super value for money but without 4G it sucks
 I want to have 3 more features in this phone
1. Gorilla Glass
2. Wireless charging
3. Water resistant

I don't mind paying 5000 extra

Samsung Upgrade it to 4G as I missed my return date , if have noticed before ,I would have returned it

On Sale I got 6gb Ram for RS. 13k with SBI card discount 1500 and got 500 Amazon pay cashback from amazon.which is fantastic. About phone, as everyone said Samsung clarity display,battery standby, camera,process, all good and decent camera. Only thing to bear is lot of stock Samsung apps and notifications. Note: As this product is only online sale, the accessories like temper glass,back panel,etc u get it only online and not in normal physical store.

Samsung has delivered a winner that ticks all boxes. Slick display, smooth glitch-free performance, monster battery life, and an outstanding camera. The only downside, if you can call it one, is the slight heft that the monster size 6000 mAh battery adds to the phone. Samsung M30s is a phone with flagship performance at a bduget price. Bravo Samsung!

Excellent phone with beast battery but the camera results aren't satisfactory and the fingerprint is also a but slow anyways it can be improved via software update it's not that big of a problem coz the face unlock is really very fast and I use that most of the time so it's not a problem for me and the display its gorgeous you will keep staring at its its amazing good work Samsung loved this one😃

Features are excellent but there is no clarity in pictures
 disappointed with camera quality and I couldn't upload the picture as mentioned above facing error as unsupported file type...
Battery backup is good.
Earlier I have used galaxy young duos there was option to set wallpaper in messaging too but this doesn't have it.
Moreover it is not supporting to change font style freely as there were many options with redmi I had it previously.
As I like this brand I went on with this but not happier with these things..

Excellent Phone. But Camera Not Up To the Mark Specially Selfie 16mp. I Have Both Device Realme XT Or Samsung M30s Both Have 16mp Front Camera. But Realme Has Far better Camera. But Screen Quality Superb Better Than 10% Realme XT. I Play Pubg In HDR Settings In Extreme No Heating No Lag. Battery Superb. Only Notice Camera Is Not Good But After Update Maybe Camera Quality Is Better. In Amazon Great Indian Sale I Got Rupees 11600 Because 10% Instant Discount 1000 Rupees Amazon Cashback. Total Rating 9/10. Worth Price.
No Cons except Selfie Camera

Processor is decently good for the price. Can run games with satisfactory results. Comes with its own Game Launcher(perfect for hiding games too :P). Doesn't lag(so far).
Huge battery, standby plus the Fast Charging is awesome(just don't leave it to charge overnight).
Camera might not be satisfactory for everyone but work good with decent lighting(example camera pics included). Camera has many features which I don't know of(I'm no camera guy).
Biometric systems - fingerprint and face recognition work great.
The SUPER AMOLED display is just awesome.
There are also many features in this phone.
Worth the price definitely. Might update this review.

Yeah I liked it but few things were bad 😣:
1. Camara- it does have various features but the picture is little blur and gives a very unnatural look a fake look maybe
2. Screen touch- it is not a very "feel good touch" also it do sometimes doesn't work well

These two are the majour problems but some goods are:-
1. Great design-i got a blue one and I genuinely love it
2. Battery life- damn seriously it is genuinely worth buying if you want a great battery life
3. Fingerprint sneser -its not very fast as per a physical fingerprint scanner but yeah it's perfect at this cost

3.Screen quality is unbelievable.
4. Price and durability and obviously from Samsung it's super affordable.

Cons:
1. Display colours' differ when pics opened it another phone.
2.Front camera is not that flagship.
3. No earphones included.

Phone is good. Camera quality good. Nice photos and the wide mode is also good. The 5MP depth camera adds much nore effect to photos in potrait mode. The video quality is nice with slow motion and super slow motion modes. Quick delivery by amazon. Due to large capacity it takes a long time cause it have a 5v 2A charger. The 6gb ram allows the to be lag free. A dedicated sd card card slot was nice. Only problem is the back cover is poly carbonate instead of metal body . The sAMOLED display provides a nice view and the dolby sound provides an excellent hearing experience but its only available when using a headphone or ear phone.the fingerprint sensor is a bit slow but ok. Overall a good phone !!

I don't think the battery is really 6k mAh. Coz I thought this mobile will remain the battery for at least 1 and half day(36hours). But what happened is if I charge the mobile 100% in the morning around 8AM the battery is drained before 8PM (not even 12 hours) of the same day.
I had a very less usage of the mobile not even I have not seen any videos yet.
Only mails and WhatsApp messages I used to access.
I'm very much disappointed on this mobile, even I don't have option to return of this product, since I opened it after 6 days. I feel this issue from my 15th day of use of this mobile.

I am quite disappointed with the quality of the product. Images from a 48 MP camera has to be more sharp and better gradient in colour.
Weight of the phone is also quite high than anticipated.
.
In total I am highly disappointed with the product and would like to return the same.

Kindly assisit.....

Hi there! I am Jogender Singh and purchased M30S on 29th September. It's been 25 days since i purchased this phone.  Actually this  phone is best. Camera quality is not that much high but still good. Don't ask anything about  battery. Samsung M30S has a great battery with super amoled display which gives me overall 11 hours of backup with mixed uses. Do not believe any rumors like it's  slow than others mobiles in same price  range. It has minor difference say 1 or 2 seconds. First I found some bugs in my phone like auto brightness doesn't work.  But Samsung fixed it in a recent update.
If you want to buy, go for it. You will find that this is really a good phone.😊

3)Processor takes more time to install  applications even in case of small size app also
4)Charger wire too short not happy but charging speed excellent
5)Screen touch not works sometimes it misses touched instructions
6)Camera quality is not up to mark, many other phone performs better than this phone

In box sim ejector pin was missing  i guess it might happen during packaging but no issue .
The main issue in this phone is camera is really not click pic as 48 MP.
Its always out of focus and clicks blurry image and slow motion feature is not working.
Body is clicky as it has a plastic body.
I will connect with Samsung and Amazon team to fix the camera issue if it stays then i will replace it.
Later Amazon helped me to return and refund my money.

Best ever handset in the range 10-15k.  Sleek fingerprint reader with high speed starting.
48 mp AI triple camera is one of the amazing feature of this handset. There are a lot of different settings and features on the camera to make a good shot according to the user's wish.
And the battery.... It's a monster as they said...
Very slow draining....
Display does not need a mention, because samsung had given their best displays in all their phones with Super AMOLED....
Overall... The best phone and you can grab it under 12600 during Great Indian festival..

Samsung M30s really fascinates me ...its 6000mah battery...48mp camera with triple setting...Super Amoled view...and its latest processor by samsung..which makes things fast a lot...so its full of great package but only ..I feel problem with its durability as most of samsung phones in simple drop ..lost its display or screen cracks which for a user....is not acceptable ..and also updates problem..occur in most samsung old devices where samsung leaves giving updates after a year ..So for medium range family ..its a big deal to buy mobile..in that changing mob in a year..is not acceptable ..Hope samsung work on it and such problems not coming with this device or any further devices..by Samsung

Just started using the product. Satisfied so far.
Happy with Samsung Smart Switch which efficiently transferred data from my old Moto G turbo within twenty minutes.
Will review after I use the phone for a few days.

No, I bought it 2days back and battery is draining out within 24hours of full charge.

This is not expected of a 6000mah monster battery,

My other phone with 4000mah itself comes nearly for one and a half day.

When videos are played on m30, atleast 5% goes down for every 30min so max 10hours of video playback.

Why the hell u people are lying when you can't give the battery as in ur advertising

Also if u use continuously, just basic operations, battery continues to drain very tasty and constantly.

Fake Samsung
Fake monster battery

Hello guys Samsung Galaxy m30s is the best option at this price point.
# Battery life is trump card of m30s easily last for two days on normal usage.
# Super amoled display is one of the best in business.
# exynos 9611 is fast chipset day to day usage fast and smooth.
# one ui is best user interface of Samsung and one of the best in android.
# rear camera takes good pictures it has minor focus issues hoping Samsung will fix it with a software update.
# front camera takes decent pictures,front images looks bit soft for my liking.
# ram management is very good and storage is also fast ufs2.1 storage.

Overall an average phone.
Doesn't feel like a 6GB at all.
Hangs quite often while operating multiple apps.
Face recognition seems like just added for the check box - doesn't really work smoothly.
The auto rotate function is a pain - have to give the phone a jerk to make it understand the movement.
Finger print at the back should be an obsolete feature now in any phone - it's too user unfriendly.
Dash charger is a joke. It takes more than couple of hours for full charge

+
Battery is a beast - dont have to worry about it

Samsung Galaxy M30s is my new phone and I really love this phone. Here is the detailed review:
1. Screen as they say Samsung's best AMOLED  screen. Very sharp and sleek resolution.
2. User interface is very very innovative and also comes with lot of new additional features . I loved the builtin night mode.
3. In Camera, you get 3 cameras at back . Low light camera mode is also good.
4. Battery is the BOSS here. It is having 6000mAh capacity. I charge my phone after 2 days of usage.
5. Chipset which you get Samsung Exynos 9611 which is really better and faster.

Personally,  I really recommend this phone to buy if your budget is under 20k.

In it's name M30s, s for "super". This is super duper phone amazing screen quality, big battery life, and good quality camera.  I am fond of playing games and seeing videos on youtube and on that it gives me great performance, great quality and upto 2-3 days of battery backup still.

Photo quality in daylight are awesome but some blurriness is in the night mode. Photos in night mode are not as good as that in daylight but still it feels good.

Phone is also somewhat slippery in hands so just be cautious while holding phone without cover :).

Alas! Phone cover is not provided with the package:(

This is the best budget phone to buy in this range.

Phone is good enough for everyday tasks. Camera quality does not justify the 48 megapixel tag as there is not much clarity. Similarly, the battery life does not feel like that of 6000 mah. It needs charging after 1 and a half day. My previous phone with 4000 mah battery had the same backup. Samsung should have included a protective case in the package.

Very worst phone  I replaced  my note 5 pro mobile . I am feeling  regret
. Please  don't this phone  ..
All of sudden  Jio network  is going  off.. even after several  restarts it is not coming
Performance  is very slow
Battery  is not like 6000 mh it is like 2500mh
He mentioned faster  charging.. no this is also not working...
Worst phone of all phone

I have used the phone for more than a week . It is a great budget mid range smartphone.The average battery life is 2 days but it takes 3 hrs to charge from 15 percent to 100  percent. Display is very clear . Camera is good quality for this price range . I will advice the customers to buy back case because the plastic body is a fingerprint magnet. The UI is crystal clear and software is quick.Overall the phone is a great buy.

Samsung has put a very powerful phone on paper specs ,they provide hardware but software is not enough optmize to handle the hardware
Like they provide 6000mah battery but it perform like 5000mah battery samsung have to optmize the battery of this phone
and 48 mp camera image is not clear as compare to 48mp camera of redmi and realme you can see in this picture they over saturate the picture  .
one ui is the plus point of this phone.

But overall samsung put a very competetive phone for all his competetor brands

Battery life is why I went for this phone and I am satisfied.  A full charge can take me through the day and still have battery remaining.  This is will bluetooth on all the time, GPS on for 4 hours, mobile and wifi on all the time.
Fingerprint scanner is slow, and does take time. Sometimes, especially during charging,  have to press power button to enable fingerprint unlock.  Camera also takes some time to focus. OS misses many new features such as copy OTP, ETC.

Pro:
Very smooth touch
Nice display
Camera quality is good
Robust battery

Con:
Charger wire length is very short, difficult to charge
Type c charger could be a dampener
There is a small lag in the UI when you disconnect the call
The UI and the user experience could be better - When you receive a OTP, UI doesnt prompt to copy the OTP so that it can be pasted later
Too many samsung apps
Slightly thick body

Wifi connectivity is very weak , my be defective part i have recieved so i have to waste my time at Samsung service center for this,,  assistive ball is not there in mobile. Phone gets heat up badly while continuously usage.

Camera quality is worst,,, as per samsung camera is 48 mp but it is worst and below than 15 megapixel,, when you will make video using this mobile it started capturing  blurred video in the middle so you need to tap on the screem every other minute to take clear video shot.  Phone takes almost 2.5 hours to charge the phone,, fuckiest charger of Samsung,, phone gets hanged using Facebook...  i never suggest anyone to purchase this phone ...

I have been using Samsung m30 for more than a month. This device is overall good.
Camera quality is okay, not like a 48mp camera but quite okay.
The fingerprint reader is good but could be better.
Battery life is the best.
Notification light is not there, this is kind of disappointment.
Well, I have a 64gb device and I have filled almost 50gb, now I feel sometimes the device is working slowly.

This device does not support Samsung pay and some other app.
The overall design is okay but it could be good or best.

So overall I want to give 3.7/5

Got this monster on 30th Sept, the delivery was very fast I got it 18hrs approx and this is my first Samsung android and I just fell in love with this since I used it. The main thing why I bought it bcz I m a big movie and series buff I use Amazon prime and  Netflix on daily basis the display is something I had never experienced before the super amoled display with full HD is very unique feature and the front camera is great too  it gives immense brightness to the face when ones do video calling and battery is great ,despite being a heavy user my phone runs well for 2 days after full charge  it's the best millennials phone in this range ...go for it a big big  thumps up from my side .

I like the concept 6000mah monster. Its true.its bettery backup is very good. I charge my phone and till night i have 67% battery. I m not game user, but as graphic and video designer i want sufficient memory and this phones give me this facility. Now i m using my favorite application efficiently. Camera is very good, i like wide angle one. Its awesome. Only one concern is that i don't understand the difference between 48mp and normal camera.  Its look same. Only one problem i find the smartphone look. Color is good but its not look premium as compare to the other phones in this price range. So it's my genuine feedback. For longlasting and efficient work please you may buy this phone.

In One Word Samsung m30s is a perfect smartphone in every point. Specially #SUPER AMOLED display. This is the best display in midranges segment. It's just Amazing quality display,6000 mah bettery is just outstanding. If u r not heavy gamer than u will get 2 dayes bettery backup easily.and ONE UI give u amazing user experience.one ui is far better than mi ui and colour os. and rear camera is just superb . Front camera needs to some improvement. Otherwise this is the best smartphone . Just go for it.  I m just loving it. I m very much satisfied with this phone.
I wanna just say if u want allrounder smartphone,this is the super  package.

Honest review for this product will be like,
Battery life is really amazing and an another feather in Samsung's hat with the super fast charging.
Inbuilt features are really amazing I have no problem while using this product, even samsung has an amazing wit of given very subtle features which gives it edge over any product.
Camera quality is super amazing but there is lack of shutter speed feature only. This hit me a lot because I love doing mobile photography. And also software update forces me to install those app which I dont want to.
Over all
-No lag
-Amazing battery life
-High speed performance
-Amazing subtle features
High speed performance

I have used almost 10+ phones and out of which this is third time I am going for Samsung again. Samsung M30s very good phone in this budget. Camera quality is good, there are some good options in camera like AR emogi. You can use two camera options in selfie mode. Battery life is upto expectation. I have used phone work gps, wi fi on for almost 8-9 hrs and have used internet, watched videos online and also done some shooting as well after all these it went till 24 hrs+  which is good for me. sAmoled display, drop notch. Just loved it.

Overall good phone in this budget with premium brand like Samsung.

Bought this for my dad. Best phone under 15k. Pros -
Amazing battery life, huge screen, and superb camera. Face recognition is decent. It is struggling under low light. Fingerprint is helpful in such cases and it does pretty good job.
Cons -
Nothing much. They should have provided with earphones is what I felt. Also back case.

Overall, it's worth the price. If you are comparing with Redmi and Vivo or MI consider the brand, resale value and warranty as well. And this is a clear winner between all the brands.

Bought the pnone on tuesday, opal balck with 4gb+64gb specification. Found minor heating issues but to no concern. Camera quality is good and battery quality lives up to the expectation of 6000mah in respect. Screen quality is excellent and vibrant with samsung one ui features it brings good user frendly settings. The  only con is the speakers are situated below as it sometimes might make the sound muffled if ur placing the phone in sone tight spaces. Other obvious troubles is no temperd glass or any back cover provided. Since it is only released online it makes it difficult to buy any back covers or temped glass from stores as they are only coming in after the release of the phone.

It has fast fingerprint reader but face recognition feature is faster .
Back camera is really best with high quality and real picture.n yes it has got best in class battery which gives you best performance.for those who work for longer hours this phone removes tension of frequent charging problem and you can use all its features to fill while working long hours. It also got a nice design which is convenient to everyone for handling.
I recommend this phone to everyone which has got big battery with all expectations fulfilled including money also.

I am reviewing this after 5 days of usage:
I personally recommend for high-usage with Long-life battery. I can give full 5 star for battery life. I got this mobile on Sunday in great Indian sale. I used for half day and charged on Monday morning 100% with normal usage(FB, WhatsApp, calls) it was 15% on Wednesday which is more than enough for smart phone. Camera is 48Mega pixel very good rear camera. I will go by my personal rating as below

Camera -4.5/5
Display - 3.5/5(there is some line back at Edge can't see some details)
Battery -5/5
Look 4.7/5
User interface - 5/5
Sound 3.5/5

Totally worth if you purchase not more than 12,500

The main feature of the phone, which is the battery, is excellent. If you are not a heavy gamer the phone battery will last between 1 and 2 days easily. The gaming experience is on an above average scale. At high end graphics the phone does show some heating issues and lags. But in a medium graphics settings the games would run just perfectly fine. Camera quality is really good. Although in indoor lighting slight shakiness in images are seen. I have had issues with the fingerprint sensor, but it does work and you just have to wipe the sensor every now and then. The screen is not a scratch resistant one and it's advised to put a tempered glass on it.

The phone comes with good processing power and excellent battery enough for 2 days use!! The biggest let down is the camera which has mediocre output even though Samsung states it to be 48MP sensor. The One UI is refreshing and much better than MIUI which bombardes ads on the OS
Overall a worthy phone at the price range

Hi Amazon Team,
It's a very bad experience with Amazon,
I never thought you will give this kind of low quality samsung phone. I am facing lot of performance problem, phone is hanging, sometimes finger is lock not works, You say battery is 6000 but it drains fast..only one day. Sensor is very bad. I am really frustrated with this mobile. Please take this back and refund my money. I will never do any shopping in Amazon.
I will place this comments everywhere, So that others should not go with Amazon.
Take this mobile back immediately.
Please call to my mobile 9036039330

Very good screen clarity, it looks very neat and appealing, Camera is very good, low light photography is excellent. Fingerprint sensor is fast and it has good speed which helps me switch between apps smoothly. Gaming on this phone is awesome and it doesn't lag while playing games like PUBG and NFS. The 6000mah battery helps me almost never run out of charge . The charger included with the phone charges my phone in a matter of minutes. The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone. I love it

The phone is good, as the battery is 6000 mah still not effective both m30 and M30s gives the same battery backup, 48 mp camera is not up to the mark, the quality of picture and details aare missing, I dont even play games still sometimes when i call the calling screen comes in 2-3 seconds and over all phone is good but not up to the mark front camera is avg. and sometimes i feel like phone is lags. even I have noticed one thing when the internet is on it dont really work good on whatsapp may be of the incapability of mobile bcz networks are good. i have to turn the data on and off to see the last seen n all.

Mobile was so good, nice backup and no issues with the phone, but fingerprint sensor is just to unlock the phone other than that we cant do much with fingerprint sensor, jus like second hand phone we will get phone and charger in the box no earphones(mentioned in descriotion) no user manual, no sim ejector, just a phone and charger. Camera was not upto the mark, only battery backup was good other than that nothing to expect from this mobile for who stays allways in.

The MONSTER is truely legend with beautiful and unique colour pattern of body giving rich look to the device.
With a practical and live example I must say the BATTERY is GOD FATHER of all the other devives.
The EXYNOS processor is the HEART on which one can really keep the trust.
Wow the features of CAMERA and Wow is the quality that includes it's wide angle and slow motion quality and AMAZING is it's front camera.
To say about quality, it has a SAMOLED display, with a smooth screen which don't need any extra protection. You will actually end up saving money.

Good phone with awesome display:
Pros:
#Display quality is excellent.
# Rear Camera is good but not excellent, super slow motion video capture is good and good photos can be captured in night mode.
#Front camera is okay.
#Battery backup is the major aspect of this phone.
#Top notch quality SAmoled display and view angles also good.
#Ram management is good even with 4GB variant.
Cons:
#Quality of primary camera is not that great because 48mp quality pictures also looks good but not great.
#If you are a heavy game user this phone is not so good option, but it is really good for music listening, watching videos and multitasking.

Bought the phone in replacement offer on sale with sbi card (replaced my M20)... Cost me just 9K... the phone is amazing... With 2.5Ghz processor (my laptop has 2.5ghz processor) and 6000 MAH battery the phone competes, check that even outperforms, even the flagship phones in the market... Whether you're gamer, social media influencer, blogger or just a normal user the phone is an excellent choice. The camera is amazing with 48MP rear tripple camera including the two wide angle cameras, and a 16 MP front camera, its an amazing choice for travelers with a nick for insta posts.

As Samsung stated a "Monster" for monster performance . But the actual product doesn't meet with their claim .
Mobile is loaded with 48 mp camera and 6000 mAh battery but none of them do their job as they supposed to be . The pictures capture by the back camera lacks in detail and front camera is kind of worst thing I have ever gone through . The claim about the battery is also seems to be false . Battery performance is equivalent to 4000mah battery .the good part about the mobile is sAmoled display .
Facial unlock in show poor performance as it unlock the phone even when eyes are closed and is slow.

Pros -
1. long battery life.
2. Good camera.
3. Nice screen display with vibrant colors.
4. Doesn't hang while multi-tasking (as of 2 weeks old phone).
5. Value for money.

Cons -
1. Takes more than 2 hours to charge full with in box charger.
2. UI is not the smoothest among other competitors (Redmi note 8 pro is better)
3. Face detection takes some time to unlock.

Camera: The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots. Additional zoom-out features for both front and rear camera is nice to have.
Battery: I am really happy with battery backup as it lasts up to approx 2 days. Yes, approx 48 hours with medium usage including WiFi and GPS.
Design, Touch, Look &amp; Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light.
The face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock. The processing speed is good enough for heavy games without much heating effect.
Thank you amazon

This phone is below average as Battery is not as claimed 6000 Mh, It lasts only 24 hrs in normal use. Charging time it takes high approx 2hrs.  Phone heats up while talking, Camera quality is good. No headphone and other accessories. Overall it is upto mark as claimed. Superb amoled screen. Good to buy.  Thanks

I like the brand SAMSUNG
Although this is my first samsung device in smart phone before this I was using moto z play as far as concern picture quality my samsung is far better according to Camera pixels and clarity memory 128 GB in my phone these two requirement I need to buy this and I am completely satisfied for this point
But as far as phone speed and functionally my Motorola was better even though that has 3 GB ram and here 6 gb ram
Battery life and charging speed motorola is far better
Look wise both r awesome
Overall I m happy customer

Don't buy this phone. It has started hanging. Battery performance is also like a normal 4000mh battery phone and definitely not like a 6000mh phone.. The upper part of the phone also heats. The only  good thing about this phone is its beautiful display.  Camera is also average.  I should have waited  for note8 pro or gone  for something  else.

The samsung customer service has accepted that they have received many complaints  regarding network strength issues. But still they are not ready to return or even replace the phone. They say software update is the only way, but that does not help either. I took it to a service center and they did some system software update from their side and still no use.

Best phone in the market  right now
Camera 5/5
Performance 5/5
Display 5/5
Battery 5/5
Built quality 5/5
This phone  is low budget flagship phone
I have played  high graphic  games no lagging  at all, display  quality  is excellent battery  life is one and a half day even for heavy users
Ppl who are saying  that camera  quality  is bad it's  blur... please  turn off the beauty mode..
I was gonna rate 2/5 for camera... but after turning off the beauty mode I've changed  my opinion... camera quality  is good too
#truly a monster 🤩

Best battery life ever. Once full charge, it last for two days. 48 migeapixel rear triple gives very fine quality images and videos.  Super amoled display gives wonderful experience in watching videos .Front camera so good that you don't need to add filters or beautification apps. 6 GB Ram give superfast processing . I played PUBG on it , its really fast.
It's best phone under 15k . If I compare with Oneplus, same configuration same features you will get in One plus 7 and that will cost you 30k. So, best phone in this price
I fully satisfied with performance and features  of this Samsung  M30s 6/128. I will strongly recommend this phone if your budget is under 20k

Fingerprint reader is good and opens within a blink of an eye
Camera quality can be more good,their is no shaking in between videos ,focus is fast in both camera and video ,quality of the slow motion is good too it's a little dark which is common
Battery life is long lasting, my use is minimal and once it went more than 2 days without being charged
Display is good enough if you want to watch movies and play games and the super amoled screen makes your phone look levels above than the others
128gb Storage is more than enough
It doesnt comes with a back cover and earphones

Met my expectations....really impressed with the screen quality....battery life is excellent...camera quality is okay for daily usage....overall a great experience at this price range...I am a flagship user and experienced devices like the Samsung Galaxy S8+,now I have a OnePlus 7 Pro....I need to say that this device has all the necessary features that a daily user will require...Impressed with Samsung's new M lineup....will recommend it to those who need a solid performance for daily usage....Only one thing which spoilt me was the gaming experience,though it was not terrible but you can have fun while playing heavy duty games like PUBG

Display super.finger print scanner excellent.camera ok.battery life not at all matching with 6000mah battery told in the specification.i was disappointed with the battery life as the battery performance not at all matching with that expected from a 6000mah battery. I didn't feel a monster battery.

This phone is worth the price when compared to standard phones available in market.
Camera is not at all as expected as promised 48mp but hope samsung will come up with some software update which will help to utilize the  full efficiency of the camera.
Fingerprint is good but need to be more responsive on my experience it always says fingerprint doesn't match but after the message it's getting unlocked.
Wake up screen is also not responsive as it should be.
Battery is awesome in this phone

Overall the phone is worth the price.if samsung overcome the glitches in camera, nothing like that

This phone is a best value for money. Design is amazing. Camera quality is much better than other phones is same price bracket. The monster battery of phone is actually a monster, I use it from morning to evening mostly for gaming and YouTube but at the end of the day the battery is positively above 50%. Screen quality is amazing and body to screen ratio is very good. Finger print sensor is fast. I have used galaxy s9  also so I can bet you that this phone is value for money with the specifications it has. Go for it.

The supposedly monster battery is a a myth. The phone is heating up with barely 15min 9f usage. I wish to return the product but Amazon is redirecting me to a support website which says invalid code. Utter wastage of money. I received the product 2 weeks late as the product was out of stock. And now this..Amazon return thus product.

Camera is descent , display is amazing.
Face recognition is slow .

Built quickly isn't so good Samsung may make it way better. Camera is ok . Battery life is nice and perfect for my busy schedule I don't have to run for charger like before. Interface isn't that good Samsung can give it more premium look.  With 2.3 GHz clock speed the processor is good till now. The super emulated screen is really impressive.  So in this price range this phone is a value for money product .

Best smartphone in this price range. Battery life is just awesome. When i get the device i charge it 85% and then medium use it . It give 2day 3h battery backup in which 30% was used in youtube. The battery was not over still 38% then i charge it.The fast charger take 1hr to charge device from 38% to 93% which is not bad for device having 6000mAh battery. Display is like 4k tv screen and vivd mode give true colour on screen. And the dark mode inbuilt in device.
Performance is outstanding.
Camera is good . I like the slow motion mode . Videos are very stable.
Recommend to buy this interesting device in this price range MONSTER. Do not buy the 6gb ram /128gb .

Best budget smartphone in the world! Better than realme or mi. M30s provides you 6000mAh long battery with sAmoled display,dual VoLte, dedicated sim slot for sim1+sim2+SDCard. Sapphire blue is just awesome colour i guess other colour variants are good too.The phone provides 6Ram+128Rom variant which is just supercool for non-stop work. In terms of the processor it had Exynos 9611 which is excellent and said to be superior than the snapdraggon 712. The 48mp triperear camera is a beast in terms of taking wide-angel shots and photos.

First of all the mobile is the best a one can have .The key feature which is claimed by the the company is up to mark its one of the best feature the company had offered, the super Amoled display makes gives you the picture quality as if the thing is going infront of you . The finger print sensor also work very efficiently ,u just touch it ,it will open the screen .and also taking about the camera the triple camera combination is top of sky I loved the pictures clicked by my M30s .It is the best combination of design,class, technology, features, comfort, colour.

Rear Camera Quality is good in day light conditions and suffers a little in low lighting conditions .. if hardware is capable then Samsung should come up with software update for camera .
.
Same goes for front camera .
.
Finger print reader is good and can be used for viewing notification panel without even touching screen .
.
Battery life is the Best part of this phone . Even charging time for such a huge battery is good enough to appreciate.
.
The body quality needs much improvement as the side panels produces creeky sound while pressing a little.

been using this phone for a month now and it has never lagged even once.... fingerprint scanner and face scanner are pretty fast... takes about 2 hours to get fully charged but the battery will never disappoint u whether u play or surf internet.... sound is loud and having dolby atmos makes headphone experience way beyond imagination.... wont gonna comment on display as samsung is best known for its display.... camera quality is not as good as it should be (as it is 48mp) poco f1 with 16mp rear camera gets better photos....but still its average... overall this phone is a beast and will recommend everyone to buy who got a budget under 20k.... :-)

This phone is best. I buy this phone to make vudeos and shoots and camera quality is so amazing and specially wide angles and colours. Camera has different modes so no need to download other apps for editing. Phone's touch censor and finger print lock is too fast and face unlock too. In this price you can buy amazing combo of every features that you want in just one phone. Really amazing quality and screen's look is also cool. Gusy i recommend you to buy this phone if your budget is under 15,000 and you want best phone ever and battery is also mind blowing. I can't see any negative thing in this phone. For me this phone is just amazing

This review is after using this device from 3 days.
Look and feel too good. But if the screen had more width iv would have loved it even more. Call quality I'll rate 10
Loved the screen. Can see clearly under direct sun light.
I don't know why they put so much bloat were? There's only 1.5 gb free of 4 gb. I especially love the always on screen. And they have to improve the dolby. Because I dint find any difference using boat rockers 510.
And the battery live is tremendous as seen on screen shot. Wish the inbuilt speaker was a lil bit more louder. And everything else works excellently.
Thanks Samsung &amp; Amazon.

Liked about this device:
1. The massive 6000mah battery.. you could just go anywhere without a charger on a full charge.
2.The display is just beautiful...detailed crystal clear and visible in bright sunlight
3. It has dolby atmos for earphones as well as bluetooth headsets.
6. Android 9 with the samsung one UI makes this one a buttery smooth device

My personal cons:
1.Camera could have been a bit better
2.No case or earphones provided in the box (disappointing)
3. Speaker aoudio a bit low (still clear)

The phone is quite slim and smooth and gives a nice feel to the hands. The rear camera requires a little more of work but still gets the picture clicked in a decent way. The only thing this phone lacks is the absence of a 32MP front camera which would have just made the whole experience great.
Battery backup is really a monster and has no comparison in its cost segment.
Samsung had developed an amloed display so they give the best in class display experience.
Overall the phone is packed with features and is more than what anyone can bargain in the cost.

Likes:
1. Battery life was excellent. With 6000mah battery no heating issue.
2. Less in weight hence handling is very comfortable
3. Rear camera, one of the best experiences for users

Dislikes:
1. Finger print reading could be made better with accessibility of wet finger. ( even little bit of sweat in hand can't able to recognize fingerprint)
2.Front camera was ordinary one. Users will expect better in this segment.

Overall, A recommended mobile for gentle users as me. Also recommend for long time users because of unimaginable battery life.

This is an amazing phone.
At the price of 13999 this phone is too damn worthy.

Good camera, amazing battery,cool colour gradient and so on.
I'm sure that you won't get a better one at this price

Good at this price. Good features. But the real samsung selfie camera clarity is missing. Led flash for selfie camera (front) is need for this phone to be number one.

Overall one can go for this phone who is not so much selfie curious.

If you are looking for a good phone for good display and battery life, this phone will fit you well.
I have gifted this to my parents who watch videos and listen to speech's and other common apps like maps, messengers etc. They are very happy 1) As the phone has good and big display (Amoled screen) 2) and they don't need to charge the phone daily even after using for long duration of time. Just to add the security patch to this phone are coming on time so i too felt happy with this.

Review after using Phone for 1week. I was a Samsung user since s5 but disappointed by this model..

1. Length of charger wire is small.
2.camera was disappointing while using in room light.
3. Design and colour was not as expected.
4. Quite heavier in weight.
5. Chin was little extra.

Overall phone was good but these are some loopholes for being best phone.

Suggest you to try realme phone..

And I  have requested to Amazon for replacement . But they suggested  for factory reset and  I  have done same thing .. but same problem occurred repeatedly.

Again i have contacted Amazon  but they have not agreed for replacement and arranged technician for verification.
Waiting for tech check.

Initially  was sceptical  about buying this phone but with great exchange offer and added festive discounts from Amazon I opted to buy this one
And let me tell you I'm happy that I did what an amazing phone. It has the best display in this segment with monster 6000 mah battery couldn't have imagined the vivid colors presentation  and top notch battery, it's super responsive and feels premium
Takes brilliant  photos even in low light above pic taken from this phone
So at the end would definitely  recommend  to buy this phone

The looks of the handset is definitely awesome. Handy, lightweight, more screen space and a gradient sapphire blue colour. Finger print recognition is good enough, though not as sensitive as the screen in front. Camera is acceptable. Whereas the main thing for which the mobile is taken,the battery life, is something which is worth the price. At 100% you can use it for two days with moderate usage and continuously online. C type supercharger is very convenient for charging this huge battery at a very short time. Overall it's best buy at this price.

Don't waste your money buying this mobile...because1)  it doesn't have gorilla glass protection, 2) it's back cover is not so good material 3) worst camera front and back 4) worst slow motion and super slow motion video clarity... 5) blur images of you zoom in the picture 6) battery is not like 6000mah 7) it takes 3 hrs to charge battery to 100%.8) it gets heat after 2 mins of use...Overall not recommended to buy this product for even for 11,500rs too.. never expected this from Samsung company.....and you people not get the chance to return this product if it got delivered to you...only replacement option is available....so don't ever try to buy this product....

Pearl White is a awesome new color, not a dual tone like other color options but bright and neat. Samsung make one of the wonderful displays and super amoled at this price is truly amazing. Having used LCD so far this super amoled display is mind blowing for content viewing and also very soothing to the eyes. Battery is a monster, 3 days and I don't have to worry about charging. Higher battery with sleek design, some real engineering done to pack beast in a normal body that is lighter. One UI is my favourite now. With launch of M and A series Samsung had informed that it cannot let Redmi and Realme take the lead. Samsung is any day better than Redmi and Realme with good customer service. With latest midrange release Samsung is the overall midrange champion.

Well for me i use phone for photos browsing  and watching movies and samsung is best for me i was comparing  it with redmi note 7 and 8 pro nd found samsung better then them for me the features are awesome taking screen shot swiping up and down the bar with swipe on fingerprint sensor, the vivid mode in display setting everything  is just awesome, according  to me this is landmark phone by samsung in this segment nd i dnt need to mention about 6000 mah battery which is out of the segment i mean its  on the top scree  quality camera quality everything  is fab, people looking for phone  under15k this is the best even it compete with 20k and 25 k phones in many features

Overall the phone is medium not good
Ram is not 4 GB but 3.5 GB actually
Rear camera shows 48 MP but 12 MP actually
When I switched on first time Ram shows 1.4 GB free after two day used Ram shows 900 MB
Camera is very weak point
Samsung cheated us
Phones network connectivity is very weak
Apps takes time to processing
Photo quality is poor
After zooming photos gets worst

Battery is huge and good for normal  usage
Fingerprint is better than m30 and other  mobiles .Handy  compared to redmi note pro
Features are advanced to that of a series
Colour is impressive.  Normal battery usage comes for 3 days for a single charge.
Only thing it's a monstrous piece better than m30 and m40.gaming is quite better even graphics of pubg .
Working processor better than m30
Phone has speed similar a series
This is the phone which made me impressive and happy with the features as big smart phones under the budget of 15,000
Drawbacks the phone doesn't provide headset

Best phone in the price of 11600 (with all the bank offers) by Samsung. The camera quality is very good but not excellent.
I am facing some issue with its fingerprint scanner. Sometime due to sweat or water on the fingers it do not work. This is not the con but other phone like realme 5 pro and realme xt there is no such problem.

Liked the processor, camera, battery, black colour(shaded) display quality and colours are also good....
There is nothing in this device that i would hate about it....
The best sorry bestest smartphone in this range......
Strongly recomended to everyone....
Already bought 2 handsets of same model....
Although the battery is of 6000mah but due to the excessive use....it only lasts for a day only....i was jst checking that for how much time the battery lasts...nd goylt those results as mentioned above.....
The scnd handset has been delivered today itself so i will check the battery span of that too then i will post the review of that too....

There are lot of good features of this phone in this budget.
1: Best thing i liked about this phone is its battery (I use the phone almost 15hrs ) still battery can go on for next day as well.
2 : Camera : Shots are quite clear and zooming is quite good as well.
3 : Speaker sound is average, but still fine.
4 : charging is also quite fast
5: Fingerprint sensor works flawlessly.
6 : I have tried pubg as well no hanging issue, and also doesn't gets hot much.

Overall best phone in this section of under 20K.

Pros:
Very good battery life
Good performance and looks
Screen quality for watching videos is very good
Front camera is good in both day light and low light
Best mobile at cheaper price

Cons
Processing time of camera is slow
Not a gaming mobile
No gorilla glass
Rear Camera is good but doesnot looks like 48megapixel

Bottom line-if you want samsung brand and add free mobile then choose this mobile .
.if you want gaming mobile then go for redmi note 7 pro..
It is best at cheapest +samsung brand...

Battery is good not the best of what 6000 mah should deliver.

Camera is the beast in outdoor conditions. It does take good shotsin indoor with little degradation in quality.

One biggest problem is while you are on call and  if you tilt the phone in a way that it is slight far from mouth, the other person cannot hear. I have not seen this happening with any android phone. The phone should be kept fully touched with your face and mouth near to the phone mic.

Poor network reception.

Very much upset with the built quality. The plastic is very light and fragile. You can feel it going inside like a button in sides with some sound. My phone has got the weak point on bottom left side and my friend's phone got it on the top right side.
Also I can feel lags when compared to my 3yr old oneplus 3.
So far the only thing that I'm satisfied is with the battery.

i was quite skeptical in the beginning on the M30s performance , as i earlier had a similar phone from other company...but this phone has taken me buy surprise ....the battery is very very powerful and indeed it laaaaaaast too long.  the phone give a jazzy look with its dual color combination of light and dark shade.
It is a light weight feature loaded phone with amazing video and photo capture capacity. the functioning of phone is very smooth and it is quite a sturdy phone.  It is certainly a value for money and would recommend for people who are worried about carrying a power bank with with their phone

I was a great fan of samsung and bought all mobiles till s4 however this company is such a big cheater. Whenever they will send any update to software they will purposely kill the performance of phone n it will become useless. I stopped using it n after 4 years with great hesitation i bought this mobile, again exactly the same first update has killed the entire phone, sound, cam speed everything.. Big cheaters stay away.

Amazing phone ...Camera is a delight to work.High quality images are pleasing and competing with my professional camera kit of Nikon D7200.
The next highly satisfying feature is battery.
My heavy usage is well taken care and am enjoying long battery with recharge once in two days.
This mobile us undoubtedly the best in this range of smartphones..

I received the phone on time. But the SIM card slot (SIM tray) is not opening. I tried few times to open it by the procedure using the needle given in the box. But it didn't opened.  So requested replacement. This may be a quality issue with the phone.

Don't fall or buy. The mobile hangs and automatically restarts. This happends after 20-30 days and the return window is only 15 10-15 days...nice logic to sell defective phone. We cannot request for refund or return also...battery is fine, but there is some issue within the mobile that automatically restarts. One time, i was not able to shut off the phone as it got hanged. Hence, went online and tried some tricks to restart the phone. Bad purchase for the first time
 My old asus phone is way better than this one, doesn't hang or restart on its own...dont fall for the battery...

If you need a Samsung phone at this pricepoint, go for it. It has Exynos 9 series processor, equivalent to Snapdragon 660. Personally I liked camera on A50 than this one. Otherwise this is an excellent choice under 15K. Battery life is insane. One UI is also very good but you need to setup properly to get rid of ads. Though A series phones has got better optimised One UI than M series.

Mine is Sapphire blue
Delivered within 24 hours.
Looks awesome.
Battery was 49% when I switched on..and after 2 hours of continuous use it is 42% now.
Camera is awesome.
Sound is loud.
Display is amazing.
Budget phone with some cons
Pros:
1.Looks stunning high end category.
2.Battery is also powerful.
3. Fast charging.

Cons:
1.Camera is not upto mark as it says 48MP it's like 8 Mp
2. Storage &amp; Memory statistics are confusing. Showing 900 mb free though I am not accessing much resources.
3. Earphone slot given at down side which makes difficult to handle phone.

Phone heating
I suddenly noticed that phone is getting overheated when we call or receive calls. Didn't expect this from Samsung. Camera quality is also not upto the mark. I feel oppo f9 pro is far better in terms of battery backup and overheating. It gives very good battery backup and no issues of overheating.

The Samsung Galaxy M30s can be seen as an upgrade over the existing Galaxy M30. It retains its predecessor's good attributes, such as the crisp AMOLED display, and bumps the battery capacity up to 6,000mAh which helps deliver better battery life. The new Exynos 9611 SoC is more powerful and offers similar levels of performance as other popular processors at the same price point in the market.

The cameras on the M30s are one area in which Samsung still needs to put in some work. We often found focusing to be slow, and the camera performance in low light was below average.

Samsung Galaxy M30s.... Without comparing any other mobiles I find this product is impressive with its design and performance. I use 6 + 128 GB and sapphire Blue. Gives the premium look and still not convinced to attach the case :). As kind of user who plays lot of games + listen music + use internet, this product never disappointed my expectations. One another important point to highlight
is camera, really amazing clarity and good options love it. Only minus I observe is on the audio quality and control still it could have better. Usually whenever I have a WhatsApp call and if I get another phone call volume automatically goes down not sure whether it's a bug or design is such a way.

Here is my review after getting M30s
The design surprise me, I thought its gonna be bulky but looks premium.
Set up all the apps and update as well
1. Super amoled full hd is the best display under
2. One UI is top notch
3. Battery is good enought, but expect more from 6000mAh
4. Performance meets expectations
5. Rear camera is good, but not monster
6. Phone automatically heats up while I was sleeping and drains 20 % battery, Dear #SAMSUNG please fix this.
Photo attached is Night mode shot.

Overall experience with M30s is very cool with its premium design.
Applications performance are smooth and very quick to respond.
Fingerprint sensor and face recognition are also quick to respond.
Screen resolution is awesome.
Excellent memory back up.
Speaker and audio quality is very good.
Battery life very much impressed, it withstands for longer period.
Camera is good, would be much better than this.But onething for sure, it's of supreme quality in the good lighting conditions.

It's real monster.

Thank you!

Over all a very good phone in this price ,speciality is that is does not hangs like the Samsung old one's,If you charge the phone once upto 100 percent then if you used it normal it will work upto 2 days, camera is really good like now a days every phone has,best thing is 3.5 mm Jack and good earphones really have a amazing sound.It settings like night mode,Samsung's app lock all other features are really good.It take around 7 days to explore all the settings of phone. I like also flash of phone when there is any notification. And lot more I can't write all.So overall it's the best phone in this range in today's scenario.

Pros:
Best screen,low radiation emission,dolby atmos,light weight,best battery backup,fast charging support,one ui support

Cons:
Front and rear cam dosent work well in artificial lighting.
Fingerprint reader is slow and not upto mark.

Overall a decent phone for the price range,Samsung made a good effort on this device, although I'd recommend 6gb variant rather than 4gb one for long term users:)

My first device of samsung. Never thought of buying samsung. But after research came to conclusion of buying it. Why it is best phone.

Compare to Xiaomi A3 it's a worth buying
Fhd plus super amlod display
A3 as HD plus display
Battery life no one can provide in this price  range
Plus samsung is trusted brand not like China mobile where you get full ads in it
 No privacy all data are leaked in China mobiles.
All other brands use sensor of Samsung.
It's better to buy from Samsung

Value for money mobile

The phone has a beautiful display and the battery easily lasts more than a day on a single charge.

The rear camera is not that great but not bad either , it does the job. The front camera is below average.

Did not experience any lags yet. Not a gamer , so cant comment on the gaming performance.

Go for it if your priority is media consumption. If you want to click great pictures , avoid the m30s.

With the sbi discount and amazon cashback the phone effectively cost me 14k for the 6gb version. For the price , its worth the buy.

1st up .Samsung provides the best screens.
Have okayed same videos simultaneously on various mid range phone n some phones in 20+ range .one thing that stands out is the quality of the screen of m30s. Have used oly MI phones before so after getting this handset I can say now it's only samsung that I will be using.
kudos to samsung for that.
You really have to use your phone continuously to drain out the battery ,it has superb battery life .
All other features are pretty good considering the price range .
any1 out there confused about which phone to buy in mid range .trust me go for m30s .and you won't regret it .the phone is that good.

Battery life is amazing
Camera may not be meet your expectations ..
It's heavyweighted because of its battery power I think..not a sleek phone..don't like the color . ..brightness sensor amazing.. touchscreen is ok..
2.5 star for mobile
5 star for battery performance till now
and 5 star for the price.. because with a brand like Samsung this is the best price phone to buy but you may sacrifice such things but it may feels you happy in many other things... because you've everything in this phone like fingerprint sensor,  bigger screen, triple camera's, super amoled Display and the one a brand SAMSUNG .. phone will makes you happy at last. ..

The Overall Performance is quiet Smooth Because of Exynos Processor But Bit High Disappointed By the Camera and Note If I am Saying Camera Than It Includes Both Front And Back Although the Pictures Taken In Light Is Quiet Acceptable But The Night Pictures Are Very Pathetic And As Far As Front Camera Is concern Than Again it is Just a logo of 16 mp but honestly it has nothing like 16 mp Rest The Phone is Ok Ok type But If you Pay That Much Money You Cant Expect Atleast Poly Carbonated plastic At Back, But Obviously Everyone have their own points So Just Go For It If You Dont Care About Camera and Build Quality And Rest Is all Fine

Overall the phone is perfect. I will not go into the details of the pros.
1. Battery is monster
2. the camera in natural light is amazing.
3. the fingerprint scanner works 8/10 times.
4. There is something wrong with the touch in the notification bar when it comes to game notifications.
5. I Love the screen, but the auto-brightness does not always work properly.
I think most of the problems on the phone are software related and can be fixed with an update. I like this phone absolutely bang for the buck.
I don't game on this phone so I can't say about the gaming performance

First if all display quality is awesome. Canera quality is also good with triple cameras when compared to previous phones. The UI is also super which is helpful to operate the phone for illeterate people. Battery is awesomewhich is giving morethan 2 days for normal usage. Wide a gle camera is brilliant idea for samsung phones. One conc is finger reader response is slow, to be made fast response with competitive toother phones. Finally Phone is showing super performance

I am surprised with the battery backup of this phone and after experiencing  this mobile my eyes never goes to battery % indicator, back camera is also very good in terms of giving real images, front camera is satisfactory in this price and my gaming experience is also very good ,only problem occurs when I try to play pubg game in maximum graphic setting although it was running smoothly but it is producing some heat  at maximum graphic setting but in hd setting and medium frame rate there is no issue at all and about display quality I have no words, amazing display quality giving real experience. I recommend all to experience this budget phone.

The screen quality for the phone is really good.  This goes for all Samsung devices. There's a gaming mode which is useful while playing games. You can use it for 2 days straight with a 100% charge. Night mode in the camera is really effective and you get great shots even with low light.  It's a great looking phone with really good built quality for the price band it comes under. Face recognition is instantaneous and the fingerprint scanner works pretty well as well. Been using it for 2-3 months now and I've had no issues whatsoever. The phone does not weigh too much and the size is also appropriate to use it with one hand. I've had no need to use an external memory card either.

Good fone to buy at this price, only flaws which I have noticed so far is it doesn't have metal body and glass is not scratch proof. On a normal use battery runs for day.
Good thing about this fone is fits in budget offer vivid picture and vedio capturing option's.
It does not heat nor hang up while charging.

It looks and feels awesome in the hand. Has a decent 6gb of RAM and 128gb storage memory. Dual SIM plus expandable memory slot. I added a 128gb samsung evo+ microSD. Has a great processor for a mid range phone. Smooth UI. A 3.5mm headphone jack. Fingerprint reader on the rear side. Gorilla glass protection for the screen. Great quality cameras to capture the best moments. Fast charging over USB type-C. A 6000mAh battery which will last more than a day doing numerous tasks on the device. This phone is near perfect!

I bought this mobile yesterday. Its a fast delivery by amaz(ing)on.About the product,The overall star is 4 because they gave assurance for long lasting battery upto 2 days but its ok for 1 and half days for normal chatting purpose and camera quality is super then coming to fingerprint reader its only for mobile unlocking not for apps etc., and the same time its ask cover ur full finger to access not just like tapping.My only disappointing is they dont give finger print acces to apps.But overall it is a good mobile.

*No screen short for screenshot.
*Does not support Mirrorlink.
* No option for hard resets via buttons only.

Excellent model from Samsung for budget price.  The 6000 MAH battery is very healthy. Performance and display are also very good. camera clarity is also excellent. No bad remarks about the product. The package does not include protection glass and cover. For a price of about 17000/- that also might have been provided. that is the only defect I have to point out.
  But the availability of the product in retail stores at a price lower than the price quoted is to be enquired into. Otherwise what is the benefit of becoming a prime member of Amazon ? I understand that Samsung Galaxy M30s is availabe at a price below 16999 along with screen guard glass and cover.

Features:
48 megapixel triple camera
Long 🔋 6000 mAh
sAmoled Infinity U display, also big enough to watch videos and movies. Dolby Atmos in Headphones and Bluetooth headset.
Last upto 24 hours on heavy internet uses and 2-3 days in normal calls and messages.
Charging takes time upto 2 hours to get 🔋 full as its battery is huge. But main part is Charger(15w fast charger)
4+64 model. Absolutely Monster.
Super processor makes this smartphone cool and real time responsive. Quick app open and load.
No lagging at all till now.

After 6 days uses, I can only say....Just go for it, it's a real Monster in this price.

Overall a good package for this price. Have used it for 3 days now, overall experience is satisfactory.
Pros:
Battery: USP of this phone, truly a jumbo battery. Charged it to 100 percent two days back and its still 35 percent remaining.
Display: Display size and clarity is quite good, touch is quite responsive. However bezel is bigger compared to oppo in the same segment.
Cons:
Camera: Despite 48 MP triple camera setup, the quality is average and doesn't stand in front of competition.
No accessories: There is no earphone, back cover or tempered glass in the box (oppo gives you all). Even the data cable is too short in length.

It got it delivered yesterday but today when I was trying to make calls, it suddenly lost VoLTE for my jio sim and keep flashing the message emergency calls on my jio sim, the usual problem of samsung mobiles, and the battery backup is also poor, it drained 30% battery for 3 hrs usage only i.e. from 59% to 29% and takes a lot of time to charge i.e. today it taken 3 hrs for being fully charged. Is this called fast charging??? My biggest mistake to purchase this mobile. Samsung is the worst mobile manufacturer and it should stop it's service if is unable to provide service as guaranteed.

I'm yet in AWW because of the battery life this handset offers.... Battery life is its strong suit. Apart from the battery the screen is marvellous too. I would say that the camera optimization could have been better and the finger print scanner could have been a lot faster.... The build quality of fabulous too, I liked the weight distribution of the device and props to Samsung for going with a Polycarbonate back and not going with the useless glass back in this price segment... Overall a good purchase and happy with the overall package....

I've now used this phone for 3 days now.. I'm pretty much satisfied with the product. It's a good product for this price.

Battery life is excellent for obvious, camera could've been far better..

Front camera performs very poorly (natural light and artificial alike)
Back camera is Okish!!

Touch is pretty good.

Look wise, rival looks far better than this one.

Overall I like the phone. At this price range, you couldn't ask for more!!

I got it for Rs 9,500!!
(Phone was in offer for Rs 14k.
I exchanged my old Redmi Note 4 : Rs 3445
ICICI debit card offer : Rs 1055)

Pros:
Camera quality is awesome.
Battery life is good.
Overall build quality is good.
Nice and wide screen , good for watching Netflix sometimes if you feel lazy to open the laptop.

Cons :
The switching between the apps is slow.
Overall processing is also slow.

Value for money..
Camera is  exclelent.. normal mode photos are very good than 48mp mode.
Portraits are simply good.
Ultra wide angle is added advantage.
Selfy cam is good enough..
Attached photos are taken from M30s in artificial lighting conditions. (2Portraits, Wide and Ultra wide).
Expandable storage is available with extra slot up to 512GB.
Build quality is good.
Beast 6000MAh battery, easly last 1 and half day with heavy usage.👍
Display is pleasing and vivid. Alwasy On Dislpay is superb👍
Fingerprint reder is fast enough. 👍
You know... "Samsung"  rich UI.. 👌
Over all good.

Me and my dad bought this phone mainly because of the 6000 mah battery and I'm totally impressed!
Mine is 6GB ram and 128gb storage which I got in for just 11,799/- during the Great Indian festival sale which is quite a steal for the features it has!
Probably the best phone in its price range and others too. When I went to a shop to  get the protective glass for the phone, the staff told me how like since 7 days, so many people have only been buying stuff for their M30s and how the phone was sold like hot cakes.
Opal black is so beautiful, definitely better than the other two. Must buy. #GoMonster

Face recognition- 4/5

The product is decent. Battery life is good, with good normal usage runs for more than one and half day(calls, messaging, camera, videos, music). Camera can't b said to be great for a 48 mp camera. Only if we are using the Samsung camera app will the 48mp resolution is available and that 48 mp does not look much as 48 mp resolution either. But the pictures are good, just forget you have a 48mp cam. The Colors and clarity of the display is absolutely wonderful. Fingerprint scanner is also fast enough.
Overall for this price this is quite a steal, considering this big battery has been packed into a phone and still it's not heavy. Overall great phone.

Not only this phone but any Samsung's device is always Great ! And about this M30s firte of all the colour is so wow ! It gives a crazy first impression. Phone never heats up or hangs between any processes. Also it can handle great load of data at a single time at a fast speed. The camera is mesmoring to eyes. The S-amoled display not only has high definition but also a beautiful colour definition and suitable brightness !! Overall I always choose Samsung over other devices ! And this M series is reigning in my whole family !
Great phone ! Great work ! Kudos Samsung !

Only battery backup is good in this phone. Camera is like 8 mp. Poor WiFi connectivity.. If another phone is connected to the WiFi network, this phone will struggle to get connected to the same WiFi. Also 4G connectivity is bad when compared to other phones. Fingerprint sensor is slow when compared to Mi phones. Battery backup is great. Overall not satisfied and sold in olx and within one week and purchased Realme XT which is better in all aspects except battery.

Best  fingerprint reader,  camera quality is just outstanding &amp; the battery capacity is as they showed in the advertisement.Just amazed by its performance.smooth and speedy.Best phone with best price. All necessities are available... Face lock shocks us as it unlocks effortlessly... so many modes in camera ( hyperlapse , slowmotion, super slow motion,  filters with adversed features, night mode, live focus etc...) .

First thing first, bearing a 6000 MaH battery people presume that it will be bulky and heavy, believe me none of these factors is to worry about.

Performance wise there is no lag in device. I play PUBG every now and then, still I have not faced any heating issue.

Camera performance is satisfactory but when we zoom and click then quality drops.

Some people ussually worry about just a 15 watt charger for this huge battery bur friends if u think practically then after a day use there will be 40% to 45% battery left and (the funny part) you just have to charge it for rest of aroung 60% charge. Which can be done in just around 1 hour.

Fingerprint reader is bit slow. Camera quality is awesome. Battery life is very good. I charged the battery 100% yesterday 5 am. Then till 2 pm, used the phone continuous using camera for video recording and pictures. In the evening I watched YouTube videos for long time. Till today morning by 9 am, the battery life was 20% remaining after all the internet surfing, calling, chatting and all.
Screen shot facility is not provided in lock button or in the quick function. I have to press volume button with lock key.
Screen display is the best. Voices are very clear is calling.
Speaker is very louder at full volume.
Overall nice product.

The phone is excellent in terms of touch sensitivity, applications and processing speed. Battery life is excellent and lasts longer compared to many other android phones. The only miss feature of this model is the camera, sometimes the camera just takes much longer time to focus. Otherwise it is a good buy.

Screen: Color are bright. Sensitivity can be improved.
Processor &amp; working: Works fast and no hanging issue.

1.Battery is good.
2.Display is good.
3.Processor is good for every day use.
4.Camera is ok,not as good as it is used to be earlier(of course to maintain the price its acceptable).
5.Build quality is below average(not acceptable as Samsung has a reputation, even Chinese competitors are way better,also effects the look you pass to someone nearby ).
6.Samsung UI is good,i like it because of additional  features definitely a plus point for m30s.
Verdict :- samsung made a good device with good price but it shouldn't compromise on build quality,for short term it will be a best seller,but in long term it will downgrade the reputation of SAMSUNG.

Reviewing after 3 days of usage-
Camera- 4/5 (change its setting to 48mp 3:4 ratio). Inside photo clicking is average
Battery-5/5 battery back up is good
Design- 4/5 plastic body makes this phone light weight
Display-5/5 best in range
OS- new to Samsung so can not rate it but it's smooth
Sound- 4/5 good quality
Touch sensitivity- 5/5. Soft press is enough
Advice- Buy a case and tempered glass for mobile

Battery superb. 2 days for normal use.
Performance very good. Very fast internet and overall performance.
Look amazing. Samoled display as they call it is a very high end look. Not affects eyes at all.
Camera too is very good.
Only problem is it hangs for a few seconds sometimes.

Really it's a great experience of taking photos with my Samsung galaxy m30s
Photo clarity was very good
My samsung galaxy M30S mobile phone security features like finger print reader is very good, erlier my old phone camera quality was poor but now new galaxy m30s is good. Battary life also good which is standby 12 hours
Phone unlock system also good when it forgot
As I already mentioned that battery life of this phone is good

I feel it's very good phone which fits my pocket and fulfill all me requirements.
My priority for phone.
1. Long battery life: once I charge it completely it takes 2 days to drain out.
2. Shock proof and better screen strength :this phone comes with Gorilla glass V3, couldn't ask for more.
3. Memory : with 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM and extendable up to 512GB Externally , what more to ask.
4. It comes with Audio Jack 3.5 and also C-type charger, not like others who doesn't have audio Jack.

Only draw back I felt is that processor is not Snapdragon.

What i only like in this phone is its display... except it nothing is the same that was written on the specification... 48mp camwra works like 16mp.. 6000mah battery works as 3500-4000mah... I regret why I changed my mood from realme note5 pro to this one..

Hope if softwares can improve camera and other performance... I am not fond of gaming so I cant say how it is in ram and graphics...

Using this Phone from a month now,
Its killing smooth, and awesome.

Wide angle and slow motion are wonderful.

Also finger print scanner is super fast, just touch and booom.

One more wonderful thing is one handed mode, where you can minimize the size of your UI in one corner and use it with one hand.

battery is Damn good, no worries for 2 days at least after full charge, that too with fast charging adapter.
I also like the UI, look and feel of phone

5 🌟

Thank you Samsung.

Everything is good except front camera quality
Battery is good
Jio 4g is working nicely
Back camera quality is good
Sound is average
Display quality is awesome
Back panel is made up of average plastic....need back cover and back cover is not available in market...for this price overall is good so 4 star...
Tip... If you are ordering this phone then order back cover or flip cover online too because it's not available in local market for next few days as mobile is new...

I like this product for its 6 GB RAM which I could not find in other phones of same range or even higher.
My residential place is located in such a place where the internet speed is less which can be compensated  to an extent by possessing this set.

I found the speakers of the phone are good.

The selfie camera is giving good photos.

Totally I am fully satisfied with the product.

6000mAh battery! Awesome; despite Samsung phones reliability on life of the phone this time its worth spending on this , excellent screen display,  except the backcover loose fixture makes you little uncomfortable but on this budget it ok, battery life is very long , exceptional finger print reader , camera quality is awesome. I  got this phone on exchange of my previous phone iPhone 6 I observed the difference which is when  i watch continuously YouTube videos on my iPhone 6 it used get heat back side but this phone is awesome it very cool even after persistent usage and you will very satisfied with this phone.

I have bought this 20days back and it started showing the colors. It is auto rebooting without any command. Waste of money and time. Please don't buy this defective product. The only good thing is battery, but if the phone is not working then what is the use of battery.

One can fall in love with Samsung Again😍🥰
I am a miui user and then went to pixel experience but now when i move to ONE UI, it's a whole new experience and the premium feel and the UI feature.
I can say it's a fully budget optimized device.
Game launcher doing it's job really good.
At start i was thinking what if i should buy Realme XT and after using it for like a week i am super impressed. I never thought i will move from MI to Samsung ever but Samsung prove me wrong.
I will suggest my friend to go for Samsung not only because of premiumness also for UI and features.
Thanks Samsung Fam. Will love to see more budget devices like this..!

Perfect phone for me...was using samsung galaxy j5 for 5years almost...wanted a 48megapixels camera phone along with wide angle and portrait..It had everything..If it would had a 32megapixel selfie camera then it would have been full on package but still very decent and satisfying selfies,It has wide selfie option which is good too.Great options in camera -food,panorama,superslow,slow,hyperlapse,portrait,wideangle,nightmode.Can improve night mode more...Love the split screen option it helps in multitasking...overall a great phone..Got the higher storage as I have experience that the storage fills up too soon in samsung.

Be it the color or the shape, my Samsung M30 is a mesmerizing phone. Quality  of the pictures are amazing, justifying the 3 ameras provided. Night mode  option for photographs makes it 'picture perfect'.
Finger print reader has quick response time.
With a long lasting battery it saves the bother of keeping an eye on the charge frequently. However the only lacking is that thebattery drains very fast when apps like tik tok are viewed.
The quick and prompt service and a good discount for the phone has enhanced the overall pleasure and pride of owning a Samsung  M30. I am happy to say it is complete value for the money paid

This phone is having below issues.

1. Network connectivity issues- Sometimes It doesn't connect calls.

2. Further wifi connection speed on this phone is very slow and videos buffer even at 5MBPS speed and at the same time net on my other phone work great.

3. Bluetooth issue-Was not getting voice in earphone during call but worked during videos. Now it's working.

4. Fingerprint  sensor sometimes takes 2-3 takes to activate screen.

5. Screen sometimes stuck for some seconds and it is like screen is less touch sensitive.

This phone is absolutely worth considering price range,
1)Amazing Display with immersive dolby atmos makes its awesome to watch movies &amp; listening music.
2)face unlock and finger print reader is better though it is slow some times.
3)camera is really great at day light and more than average at night ,
Though pictures look awesome, noise is seen &amp; still pixalated.
4)believe it! battery is really great !  2 days on moderate usage and 1 day on heavy usage.
Considering its price range  samsung m30s is worth it.
Samsung m30s a great comeback!

Only plus point in this phone is battery.
1) display is smooth, good.
2) both front camers and rear camera gets 1 start, forget about 48MP you won't even get 10 MP, front is also useless, pictures pixelated and dull.
3) It take 2hr + to charge full battery from 0% to 100%
4) weight is ok ok, not too light nore to heavy
5) fingertouch doesn't respond few times so have to use password.
6) less features then redmi mobile
7) camers do have many features, like ultra slow, slow, night mode, food mode,live focus, pro mode, video and photo mode.

I bought this phone to gift my dad. He is a businessman and have hobby of photography. 2 things which he really need in a phone is good camera quality and high battery life as he attends 50-60 calls in a day and heavy use of internet as well.

He is using the phone from last 3 weeks approx. and he is quite happy with the phone picture quality as he is able to send lot of his product image to his customer sitting in different cities and able to use the phone whole day in a single charge, That's what he needed! Great phone in reasonable price.

Quick Review:
Pros:
1) 6000mah battery is the coolest  feature of this phone.
2) Rear cameras are pretty impressive. But there is just single flash. In night photoshoot you'll  miss dual flash.
3) Design is awesome.
4) Latest Android update.
5) Screen is smooth.
6) RAM, ROM and processor are enough to play heavy games like pubg, call of duty.

Cons:
1) Finishing is not good.
2) Front Camera is so bad even below average. I didn't like it.
3) Heating issue even on call.

This phone is nice one in their segment. Thanks Amazon for one day delivery. This phone has large battery which lasts for two days with my regular using pattern. Camera quality is quite good but its interface is not so user friendly. Somtimes Depth function  of camera shows some lag and not perform very well. I personally  feel its fingerprint  sensor is little  bit slow as compared  to my previous phone moto g5 plus. Here I miss phone locking system through fingerprint sensor. I am not a gamer so I am not commenting  on its gaming performance. I personally  feel Samsung  logo should be bold because sometimes  it looks  like a simple Chinese  phone.

The phone is design with perfection. Over all it's value for money with all basic nedds. However few thing could be improved.
The phone have 6000mah battery with inbuilt option of fast charging and regular charging mode.. even if the phone is in fast charging mode.. it takes almost more than 2.5 hours for charging.. while other compition  brands charging is actually more faster in regular mode.. same can be improved.
With such a good back colour .. Samsung could have provided the transparent back cover for protection as well as the earphone is missing with he pack.
Over all a good device in budget

I am using this from last one month and what i have observed m30s having very nice feature if you compare to other samsung product like samsung 9plus. Its fingerprint reader very fast even face unlocking is very fast. Built quality is best and processor is superb if you comapare to ANY other brand in range of near by 20k.

Camera is also fine but yes video quality is very nice in super steady mode. I bought this only to play pubg in extreme level as no other phone can give you extreme level in range of 20k if you invest more than 22 k than you can get extreme  level otherwise not at the end in this price range the phone is superb.

Battery: 4/5 (6000mah powerhouse takes a bit time to charge but stays for sufficient time)
Camera: 3/5 (though 48mp still lacks details and depth. Good lighting and a lot of functions for serious clickers)
Screen: 4.5/5 (super AMOLED screen is the biggest eye-popper for this phone as screen really feels good to eyes with awesome colours and wide display)
Processor: 3.5/5 (the processor is working just fine but Samsung phones become slow after some time)

Overall: 4/5 (Considering the brand Samsung and 11,500 net price)

Can't ask for more.....just good software updates!

Thanks to Amazon for Amazing deal ;)

In its range its really one of the most wonderful  phones you can pick up. I was looking  for a obile phone which gives an amazing battery  back up and this is  exactly the best one in the midrange budget which is an absolute  beauty.
Samsung should really put less bloatware in its preloaded models however.

The mobile phone was delivered within 24 hours. I am using this mobile for past 4 days,this mobile is perfect in all norms.The battery pack of 6000mAh is really monstrous,I used the mobile for 10 hours after one time of full charge.This mobile have perfect RAM management which is snappy and fast. Coming to the camera,the rear camera with 48MP sensor works good, but it takes too much time for saving the image they must fix this immediately .The colors in outdoor pics are very natural. It fails to capture a good picture in low light mode. The face lock is fast than the fingerprint sensor. Overall it's a good phone in this segment.

The mobile is not heavy though it is provided with 6000mah battery. The display and the sound quality are very good. This is an affordable unit by middle class people. The camera performance has to be improved to give sharper pictures. The sensitivity of the fingerprint reader has to be improved. Samsung brought out a mobile with reasonable performance at reasonable price.

I bought 4/64GB varient and with Amazon cashback and SBI card it cost me Rs.11,500. Really pleased with the product.

Pros:
1.The build quality is good
2. Awesome AMOLED screen.
3. Battery life is superb. Without gaming if you use just for calling, whatsapp, browsing etc.  then can easily last 2 days.

Drawback:
1. Slow software as compared to RedMi Note 4 which I was using earlier.
2. There's a special mode for 48MP camera which clicks great pictures but takes time to save them(2-3 sec). So you need to keep your hands in the same place for a moment even after clicking the photo.

It looks this is the much hyped product on Amazon but in reality it's not up to mark. Brought this few days back and noticed the below issues.
1. Delay in locking the screen upon clicking on Power button.
2. We have to press back button multiple times in few cases.
3. I don't see the benefit of 48 mega pixels. It looks like an ordinary camera.
4. Minor issues around finger print sensor.
On the whole it's not worth for money. Not sure how this got better rating on Amazon. This is not only my review, some of my friends bought it and had the same complaints.

I am a Samsung user from eternity when during diwali sale I thought of upgrading from A 10 M30 s came loaded with features I always wanted to be in one phone...with 48 megapixel camera and such a long battery life were two things got me at first instance.. I am using it for almost three months and nothing bother me...watching movies was never as clear before.. than Samsung for keep on bringing such products for us

I bought the product 2 months ago and found to be among the best users...the phone has got a great camera setup along with best in class processor......the phone comes with tear drop notch displays that help to acces full screen without much intruption of notch.....i have been using the product from last 2 months and never found any kind  of lag or bugs...Samsung has tried its best to give out the best battery life that last  around 2 days on single charge nd providing a USB type C is such budget smartphone is really a great step....

Camera Is decent. Front camera is fabulous but back is Okay in compare to other phones in similar range. It looks classy in my hand and that is the most attractive thing.
(Go for 6Gb instead of 4 Gb. My personal advice )
Fingerprint is not that good just Okay Okay.
I don't like Face recognitio of Samsung because Phone could be unlocked even when your eyes closed.
Overall Its good phone. For a regular use I would say Its very decent phone in decent price. At this time you can Go for A50s or A51 if you have a Budget

Really impressed and happy with samsung galaxy M30s.
 It has really good features and has an amazing camera of 48 megapixel with triple lens.
This phone has all the features at an affordable price plus it provides offers like 1 year screen replacement warranty.
 Also, it fulfills one really important comcern that is,battery life. This phone provides a 6000 mAh battery.
 I've used this phone it can  run upto 2 days without charging.
I love to use samsung phones and this one is the best among all that I've used

M30s ...literally the best budget phone Samsung has ever made.....monstrous battery and superb sAmoled display ....48 mp triple cam with 8mp wide angle and 5mp depth ...front cam 16mp although front cam doesn't provide the best selfies comparing to other 16mp devices it's quite good  ...sleek and weightless design eventhough having 6000maH battery...nice experience...with the phone ...till date ...no problems faced ....but do remember to buy  a quality case and tampered glass  to protect from major damage  .....rated 9/10 due to camera quality  ...overall great device....as like a must buy product

If you are a camera lover, this is not the right choice. Samsung is cheating its customers. Phone has a maximum of 12 MP camera but it is claimed 48MP. I also have a realme 3pro which has far better camera than this phone. Although screen is good and battery is the best one. I given just 3 stars coz samsung disappointed me.......

I got this phone as a surprise gift from my brother.Firstly,the color play on the display and backside of the phone is definitely eyecatching and beautiful.Being a medical student,i always wanted for fast charging and long battery life phones without being too heavy to carry.Samsung galaxy m30s does a great justice to these requirements of mine.Another reason which makes this model my favorite is the excellent  triple camera and the kind of depth it adds to my hobby-photography.And the most affordable price in which it comes is just the cherry on top.Definitely a smartt buyyy and worth the price.

Phone is very good but only set back is that the back door of the phone slightly sounds by holing/pressing the phone both sides.  I replaced the phone due to the same reason but the new piece which I again recieved is also making sound after few days of use. It seems that the design of phone only causing this problem. This not big issue and it is not giving any software and  hardware trouble.  I am very much liking and loving this phone. Economically it's the best phone with more features. Thank you Samsung for giving budgetary phone and love u Amazon for your hassle free supply and worthful exchange offer deals👏👍

I am using first time Samsung's phone, before I used Moto and MI
Camera is not better than MOTO G first generation, So many basic features are missing as compared to MI Note 4. No compass and FM.
Only good thing is battery backup is good.
Charging time is very high.
I am not so happy with this phone.
Think before purchase.
 No sensor for missed call or received a message.
Touch is smooth, No hang till days (used 8 days), speakers are good,
As per features it not more than 10,000

I am writing this review after using 3 months.
Front camera is very good as compare to back camera. Super battery life, once charged you can use easily for 1.5 days. Processor is very fast and no heating or hang. Build quality need some improvement. Mobile comes with gorilla glass3 and but my display got broken after one month when I have both back and front cover. So I think company need to keep on eye on build quality also.

Excellent battery life one the core reasons for buying this phone was to get a good battery life from my phone. Display is good and 128 GB is pretty good for day to day storage task.

Excellent phone. Highly recommended new version of the phone called M31 will be launched soon.

Go for it.. best phone in this price category. I purchased it for 116000 with sbi card discount and 1000 Amazon pay balance discount.. I ll suggest to go with m30s instead of samsung A50.

- I have compared the network strength of Samsung M30s with other Mi phones of the same operator. The results are shocking. I am receiving -105dBm in M30s but Redmi Note 7 pro is giving -75dBm. I am facing frequent switches between 4g,H,etc. May be due to these frequent network switches battery backup is also not as good as it is supposed to be for a 6000mAh battery. I am able to consistently use 4g network using a third party app which provides an option for LTE only but the network reception is still very bad.
- Front camera images are not sharp.
Hoping that Samsung will soon provide an update to solve this problem.

It's been a week I am using M30s... Mobile is very good and very durable battery life and moreover it's takes very less time to charge than most of the other mobiles. I would recommend this phone to everyone.. Worth for money. Camera quality is great, no heating issue. If I have to tell about cons I would say only cons is if you are not having M30s 😋😋😋😋

I am adding to the review I have written before 2 weeks.. Whatever I have mentioned above stays same... Finger print reader and face unlock is damn awesome.. 0% battery when I went for your and it stood for 3 hours and in between I have received 2 calls... Loving using M30s 🤩🤩🤩

Above all, I would like to extend my gratitude and thanks to Samsung to come up with an exclusive game-changer budget phone with all the premium features. Talk about any feature either its Display, Battery, Processor this gives you a spellbound experience. I have been using this phone for the last 10 days and have installed about 201 different apps including games like Real cricket, Asphalt, Real Racing 3 and this phone is really a "Beautiful Beast"  in performance and Presentation. It has got quick and efficient fingerprint reader, awesome battery life and great camera quality.  Glad to possess this Monster.

It is the best Samsung phone to buy around Rs15000. It has an excellent camera , it maintains the skin tone and it has a very good ultra wide angle mode even in video recording. I can create a very stable video using it which is very appreciative. And I also can get Super Slo Mo which is very good.It has a very nice battery. With normal usage I can use it for 3 days easily. Its screen is very good and it has a very nice color. Always on Display is very very good option, I can get notification without opening it. Instead of very huge battery, it is thin and light which is best according to me.

Overall an okay-ish buy. However, being a former Redmi Note 3 user, I feel the haptics and fingerprint reader pale in comparison to Xiaomi phones. And the OS isn't much to ravish about either. Despite being a new phone, it hangs quite a bit and the lock screen notifications have contrast issues. The phone also has heating issues while gaming (Call of Duty, PUBG, etc).
The only pros are the camera and battery life.

In hindsight, I feel the Redmi Note 8 would've been a much better option.

I would like to share a positive response on this Samsung M30s, Kinda using this device for the past 14 days, Sounds good with a good display and a camera of users choice. The night mode is good. Well known that the battery backup is absolutely a good one that lasts for two days on normal usage and one and half days on heavy usage. Samsung had given its best product as usual. A happy review from a happy user. A sample photograph is attached to this, Its a photograph taken in this mobile on a fine evening!  Samsung is considered to be the best in quality, now and then.

Excellent phone I would say. Samsung has nailed it at this cost.
Build quality is very good. Battery life is 1.5 days ( with my use, always on 4g), screen on time is around 8 hours as average.
6 GB RAM surely help on performance. Now come to million dollar question CAMERA... It is good and can click very good images, attaching few here. For a normal user like me who use WhatsApp, FB , some games, internet browsing ...easily the phone to go.

Within the budget 15k this phone standout to be the best . Talking the camera it delivers good photo shots even in the night the shots acceptable.
Battery life standsout to be another major point to discuss, which gives a standby of more than a day .
No lag, no glitch, no flickering has been experienced till now . After using for more than 3 months I am quite satisfied and I should recommend this to you over redmi, realme for quality and experience that it delivers.

Pros of this phone is as i used it for 4/5 months just only the bettery life which generally go for 2 days with moderate usage and charging also fast. Samsung claims it has a 48 MP camera but i dont think so as per the clicks. Body of the phone is not upto the mark in the same budget categoties...as u may find better....
Overally, its not as per my expectations. I know there r positive reviews as well, but consideraing other phones in the same budget category apart from bettery rest of the fratures fall short of expectations.

After using for 3 days, here are my reviews
At this price, this phone is great for those  who wants almost  everything  in a budget  phone
better camera,smooth touchscreen, Samsung UI is great, pubg and GTA runs on maximum settings l, fast charging and longer battery  life optimized for whole day of usage etc.

NOW coming to issues with this phone,
1.Gets a little  heated during hotspots
2.Image quality and depth is little disappointing
3. A little heavy for pocket

This is by far my reviews for M30s. I will update more later.

Super doper phone in this price range, you can find similar feature in other brand but what i like in this phone is
1. SUPER EMOLED display
2. 6000 mah battery
3. Android stock OS
Apart from this camera quality is awesome it gives accurate colors it will not saturated or modified like oppo and vivo.

If you are looking for this phone because of 48 MP camera then forget about it, the camera is disappointing, photo quality is similar to any other 12 MP camera, don't know why brand like samsung is claiming to have high resolution camera when it is not actually giving as par results.

Only positive aspect is the look and feel which seem premium and the battery is good, if you prefer Samsung then I would recommend to go for some other m series phone with much less price such as m10 or m20 from Samsung those will offer similar results as that of m30s

Very very good product. Great battery life, good camera, great screen, fast finger print scanner, good processor. Everything is good about this mobile. Only downside is that the mobile is quite thick due to the massive 6000 MAh battery.

That's what you call a budgeted smart phone satisfying you more than buying any other expensive phone.  Perfect technology advancement, i am using samsung from last 8years but one thing about this phone is its front camera beautifues your picture like MI or vivo but samsung other's camera does not do that. Its picture quality has always been the real, original and clear which for me is a bit negative change.
You should have been stick to the original camera pixels.
But this phone is hell amazing.
In budget
Stunning camera
Display which forces you to watch again and again
All and all you have to buy this product.

The phone does not work as per the specs at all. Apart from battery nothing is good in this phone.
Worst camera .... 2 MP cameras can take better pictures then this.
Phone is slow.

Do not buy the phone looking at the specifications,  they will just trick u into buying the phone.

Instead go for a similar range Mi model. Their cameras are far better.

I had doubt that I got a second hand phone , so i did call to the amazon customer care they also said that these IMEI no are registered to new device (They Lied), Today my M30s working so poorly and i am barely able to use it(almost useless condition now due to some software issues), i confirmed that i wasted my money on a 2nd hand product.

Camera: The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots. Additional zoom-out features for both front and rear camera is nice to have.

Battery: I am really happy with battery backup as it lasts up to approx 2 days. Yes, approx 48 hours with medium usage including WiFi and GPS.

Design, Touch, Look &amp; Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light.

The face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock. The processing speed is good enough for heavy games without much heating effect.

The phone exceeds all my expectations, shifted from galaxy j7, so the expectations weren't high enough, but still best bang for my bucks at 11600, or 14000 even. Don't go for it if your main focus is gaming, get a note 8 pro instead for just 1000 extra. Pros, massive battery, great display, awsome ui. Cons bad Build quality just the back panel though get a cover and u r good to go, Weak processor compared to competition with likes of realme 5 pro, vivo z1x, but good enough to ease its way with day to day usage and some limited gaming time. Don't game too much or you're fingers will feel the heat.

I ordered this phone 03th sep 20119 delivery in the next day, thanks for amazon fast delivery. i am using last one month , The over all phone features are good with in this Price 12,730 in great Indian festival  offer. especially the battery 6000 mAH is best and long lasting for more than 2 days in normal inter net use. The phone display  Super AMOLED AND 90 % Screen radio is good  and the camera 48 MP Picture quality is not up-to the mark compare with  competitor 48 MP phone, but  over all quality is good with this price range and thanks for Samsung reliable quality .

It's a poor product with too much hype. Camera claims to be 48 MP but image quality does not match even 8 MP quality. Plastic back body which gives it a cheap product look more prominent in white color. My regret purchase. Do not fall in love with the specifications given. Regretting big time and moreover Amazon will not exchange the product. Many times these platform acts as a medium to distribute cheap product due to higher profit margins for them. Many phone such as Redmi Note 7 are much better phone at lower price

After 2 days usage I feel it's one of the best budget phone..but charging is very slow..mine take 10% to charge in 30 minutes  don't know what kind of problem is ..
Will update u further  with more details.
***updated...8/10/19
Charging is not as much slow as compared to battery...charging at constant rate apps 21% after reset at every 30 min..
Rest Display is mind blowing...
Performance is also good..
Little bit disappointed that Gorilla Glass is not present but still Samsung has given the care of display by partnering with 1 yr screen replacement policy with akko.

Fast fingerprint sensor
Fast face unlock
Camera quality not up to the mark
Battery life is very good
Super amoled display is perfect
Pubg does not get lag in HD setting with high frame rates
Some YouTubers may misguide by saying that cracking sound from back panel or back panel is very weak ...but but but in real no such problem can be seen
Some other YouTubers say that it can't catch full network..I m using Jio Volte with full network
They are just faking bcoz of the paid promotion of Chinese brands like MI,REALME
Overall-4/5 at this decent price

Best mobile in this price range. Battery is really monstrous. Samsung has worked on hanging issues in recent models I think. Works without even a single glitch. Best buy. sAmoled display is very very good. Display is very attractive. LED consumes very less battery hence battery drains very slowly. Only drawback is, backside is little dull. Hope they start providing gorilla glass on back cover also to avoid scratches.

Over all good smart phone in this rang.
Fingerprints reader work fast but some time it may take 2 or three attempt.
Back camera picture quality awsome but as compair 16 mp fornt camera picture quality with other phone it's slightly behind. Battery life no other phone stands against M30s so much Battery back. But some features are missing like network speed, Compass, massages blocking by keyword, folder hide, and one most thing hiden photos albums (secure photos ) seen in other stetting when change profile pictures it not completly hide... hope gays you work best on this thing and released updted for missing features.

It's a very good mobile and ticks almost all boxes I wanted
1.Battery life looks good and lasts couple of days on a full charge... but I don't watch videos nor play too many games
2.Camera is good but never quite understood why there are 3 of them at the back
3. The touch response is very good and the front look is impressive
Somehings I would also recommend to have are..
1. Notification LEDs for missed call alerts and charging status
2. Little bit longer charging cable

I have been using this phone for 20 days now and its performance is very good.
Very nice mobile with a powerful battery which can easily last for more than 2 days (with internet on),
Fingerprint reader is very fast and unlocks the mobile in less than a second (almost instantaneously),
Camera is very clear with a wide range of options for both still and motion photography.
Face detection also works fine and is a secure way of locking my phone.
Display is as usual very good (full marks on super amoled display).
Lastly I will say it is the best vaue for money in its category and a definite recommendation.

It's a perfect dominator under 20,000. I am using this since almost the month. It's camera has a premium quality and also contain premium features like very high quality night mode shoots. Fingerprint reader is the awesome  and fastest has no lags till date of my usage. One of the unbeatable feature of this is it's Biggest Battery of 6000 mah which last for more than 2 days of normal usage with ease. Samsung amoled display has no comparisons even under the high price smartphones in the country. And lastly you will get a world renowned brand with lots of premium features in just below 20000 which uncompareable and unbeatable.

Well featured and specific and detailed performance . Camera is perfect and battery performance is at point as it lasts for 2 days even on full usage of gaming and video streaming Netflix and YouTube.  The design and colors are sleek and stylish and Samsung has achieved the goal to make the M series affordable and as per expectation compared to other premium phone .Rated accordingly because deserves it . Over all review is that it is monstrous with its performance in every aspects . Go for it .

After a long time, Samsung launched a phone in the range of 13000, which beats its competition hands down.  I got this phone for 12,600. It is the best device in this price range and is way better than other brands like realme, xiaomi, oppo, vivo, honor, lenovo, meizu etc. Its battery is excellent, interface is fluid, screen resolution is fabulous, camera is just great and does not contain bloated crappy software, like xiaomi and other chinese phones do.  On 5th March, Samsung is launching Galaxy M31, which has even better config.

About the phone the battery packup is so damn good that it will work for whole day in a single charge.
Excellent camera 48 mp with macro and micro lens
Super amoled display which enhances your interaction.
Fast charging is also very good
Overall i will 4.4/5 rating to this phone

I think Camera Quality is good at this price range.
Also wide angle camera support is there.
Display is awesome..
Performance is very good.
Battery is also perfoming good.
Always on display takes up too much of battery.
There were no lags while playing Games like COD etc..

Fingerprint scanner is slightly slow some times..
And the phone feels..little bulky on comparing with other budget smartphones..
OVERALL m30s is the best phone at this price range.

The most appreciable thing about this device is it's battery it's generally gives you a backup of almost one and half days on a single charge. Display is also awesome as we already know that's its a super amoled display made by Samsung may be better if it comes with Corning gorilla glass protection. Another good thing about this Samsung device is it's processor Exynos 9611 as it is a processor made by Samsung itself so RAM management and hardware and software optimizations were very good. Go for it if you want a trust of brand along with great specifications in a considerable price segment.

I like Samsung m30s till now and I'm so happy to make the right decision.
Talking about this phone, this comes with great battery life and I charge the phone in morning and it goes throughout the day. The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. The pictures are clear and sharp and the night mode is also very good to click in the dark. I already have 400 plus photos in my gallery. The storage capacity is not a worry either, I've the 64gb variant.

The display is really very good. Everything so bright and clear. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I feel this is the best phone I got.

I can definitely say that this is a overjoyed phone and failed to deliver for what it has been released to market.
1. Display is awesome super amoled display... You can watch videos for a longer time with no pain to eyes.
2. Camera is at its best... Clear and crisp images you can get in the 48MP mode
3. When coming to battery, I can say this is a beast in the industry. Using the social network apps in regular, the full charged battery comes 2 days.
Overall it's an awsum budget phone

M30s is a damn good phone, given its price segment and a premium 'Samsung' tag. The processing, operations all have been excellent uptill now.
Pros:
Battery life is amazing
Speed and processing
Slim given its battery
Looks elite

Cons:
Camera is not very good compared to others in the same segment. Low light performance is dull.(4/5)
The clipboard option available in my Galaxy S6 isn't there on M30s.
The display is not as crisp as that of other Samsung mobiles.(4/5)
Fingerprint reader falters at times.(4.5/5)

As always Samsung has done a phenomenal Job with Display and I love it, its very pleasing to eyes. Camera quality is nice too, great pictures at adequate light conditions and wide angle camera is a cherry on the top. It's very intuitive to use, produces some nice shots. Fingerprint sensor is ultra-fast, no hassles whatsoever. Battery life is superb, 6000mah is massive to get the work done for 2 days easily without charging  it.

Product is good nice and decent quality at this price only should increase the length of adapter and Samsung should provide earphones or back panel cover also .

Camera is fine gives a natural photo not like the edited one in vivo or one plus
Charging is fast charging but takes time to complete charge your device coz of 6000mh battery
Gaming is good no issue with game especially when you turn on your game mode
Display is brilliant
Also guyzz it's Samsung so lasting is guaranteed

Shocking performance. After 10 days only it performance revealed.but return/ exchange closed.Great disappointment especially for me. I am the regular customer in amazon and first time lost money.Not able to speak more than 3mts. Then it will be disconnected automatically. Most of the time voice breakage. Out of 10 calls only 1 r 2 can listen with average audio. Better don't buy this product

Awesome good for travelers ... fingerprint access  are too quick to enter no tension in that while handling it in one hand ,for photo freeks it's a much needed device the picture quality is unbreakable when zoom it n the wide angle aspect is good in covering a whole part of view like an eagle eye and the much hazel  free aspect of m30s is its battery  life its going on and on unstoppable  for full day of access even more helps in travelling finally a product for all in all aspects the plastic finish may sound like bit odd but its handy no problem with that powerful reliable  and cost effective product ...

This phone has an amazing camera with great features that deliver good quality photos. The battery life is much better than some of the other phones I've used so far. Smart view pop up is yet another feature to praise. Playing games with good graphics, no problems. The phone however hangs a bit on using multiple applications. Finger print reader is doing just fine. Overall rating would be 4* and I'd recommend to buy this product anytime. I'd like to give a 0* to Amazon delivery services, it just sucks even with prime membership.

The Phone has a great touchscreen display with a resolution of 1080×2340 pixels which provides u HD quality. Powered with Octa core Processor. 4 GB RAM and faster charging. Expandable Inbuilt storage of 64 GB. 3 high quality rear cameras and a front camera for attractive selfies. A full on bumper package with a nominal prize on this festive occasion. I have bought and having a joyful experience. I am working professional have to work 24×7 need to do face time with many of my clients and with this phone my work is going on smoothly. This is very competent than its other market competitors in such a reasonable price. Buy it soon.

After 3 days of use...
Like:-
1) looking very nice.
2) battery backup is very nice.
3) not hanging problem.
4) internet speed is very faster in low network
  strengt.
5) very faster charging.

Dislike:-
1) camera quality is not good.
  i) camera like 25 mega pixel
  ii)when open 'slow motion' camera in night
  light it's blinking continuesly... you can
  use Slow motion only in sunlight.
2) fingerprint scanner is not good... Sometime
  its doesn't work for 5 to 10 sec.

The phone is getting hanged atleast 2-3 times a day even when I am not using it.... Sometimes camera doesn't work, the app will open but screen will be black. Battery life is very good and camera is good. Not for gaming as it heats up pretty fast but for the rest of the task it's works fine.

I was very clear about  my requirement. I just needed long battery as I don't  like carrying  power  banks or chargers. But everything  else I got are bonus. Storage is good. I'm not into selfie or photos but  camera is decent. Though  learning  how to operate  is a pain. One needs to do so many settings  before starting  the camera. Few apps lag but generally  fast. Videos are not 100% stable. Screen scratches only con

Again you can't  get everything in one single phone. So be clear on requirement. Makes it easy. If you're  looking for long battery then definitely choose  this one

So I been using the new Samsung M30s for 3 days now. The highlight point I want to stress is its FAST.  Everything works crispy and fast . To add to that even the face unlock is very much better responsive and quick than other devices I used .
All other stuffs like camera battery works superb as it's been advertised.  What was a slight disappointment was that there was no knox powered secure folder app in M30s.  Well it's a handy app to keep our files and things secure so I dearly miss it. Other than that I must say a great phone at a great price.

It's been almost a month since I bought this for my aunt. The phone is better than my &gt;45000 rupees Galaxy S8 in many ways.

Clear call quality,
nice cameras,
long battery life,
good display,
no lag during normal usage - all 5 basic expectations are covered.

Will review again after a few more months of use.

Excellent performance with monster battery life. No need to charge the phone earlier than 2.5 days. Camera clearity is good nonetheless resolution could have been better. Clock speed is good compared to other phones in this price range. Screen resolution is higher and touch screen interaction is smooth. So far this is best value for money phone. Couldn't get  phone with higher specifications than this one in this price range. In past i didn't get along with other phones more than 2 years but for this phone i can feel that i will easily use for more than 3 years.

Battery : The best feature of this phone. Just charge it for once and do whatever you want. The monstrous 6000 mAh battery lasts forever.
Gaming : I enjoyed a lag free experience on PUBG Mobile &amp; Asphalt 9.
Camera Quality : Its good essentially it comes with 4K recording which is the best feature I thought is for this camera.
Display: It's a Super Amoled display looks amazing.
Fingerprint Sensor : It's very fast. Just a touch of your finger and your phone is unlocked.

If I were to define this phone in one word it would be - The Best and the Best

Dear Viewers I am written this review after usage f 15 days of this phone.

Pros:
Superb phone with monster battery life.
Display is good.

Cons:
OTG is not supported in this phone.
Camera is not like 48 megapixel.
Charging cable is very short and back cover is also not provided in box.
Back side of phone is simple and plastic not giving rich feel in this price segment.
OS is ok
Finger print sensor is ok not much faster as redmi.

So the conclusion is not looking for battery life. Other things are also important.

First time, Samsung released the best mobile (Samsung Galaxy M 30s) in competitive price. Still there is scope of more advance phone in pocket friendly price. However, I'm very happy with this product and recommend others without any hesitation.

Very quick fingerprint senior it responds instantly. Fantastic trible camera setup can take 4K videos and super steady image stabilization is awesome. Slow motion with FHD and Super slow motion are the gift for the user wich are normally available with higher end and costly mobile. I thank Samsung and the sales partner Amazon for getting this real Monster at the price range of 10999 (Actual price 13999, Bank offer 2000 and Amazon pay back 1000) and I am really happy about this Festival season. No words to talk about Battery life with quick charge in the box its the MonstEST among the rest.

Fingerprint reader responses slow, if i talk about camera it has a lot of noise when i capture a picture, this kind of camera quality is not expected by such a reputated brand, on the other hand its battery life is good, i'll rate it 4 on scale of 5. One more thing i want to add is after using this phone for 3 to 4 months is speed decreases. Please upgrade the online products as customer only trust you for your brand value and if we dont get that its a sort of cheating that a buyer feels, so please be genuine when you promise something while promoting a product

#GoMonster it is truly as it is said 6000mAh battery runs 2 days for single charge on my usage (Watching YouTube, playing PUBG, listening to music and much more..). The camera quality and the wide angle camera are absolutely astonishing and amazing, the pictures are bright and colorful and 6.4 inch SAmoled full HD display gives a wonderful view. Security is also good face unlock works even in dark room and fingerprint reader is a little slow which should be enhanced a little and final part the phone is an absolute marvelous gadget under the rate 17999/- . I recommend you to buy the #M30s aka the Monster phone without any hesitation.

I received this phone after a long wait... i hd ordered on 29th sep'19 and received it on 5th oct'19..
Coming straight to the point.. phone has all the features wat samsung claims to have.. monster battery uu can say.. jus wat i was looking for.. each nd everything is been deliverd by samsung as committed.. only con would be the camera clearity.. though it is claming to have 48mega pixel nd 16megapixel bt it really lacks that edge nd quality.. those who a looking for a good camera phone shall nt recommend the same.. bt overall performance is awsome.. shall rate 8 out of 10..

Using this phone since launch....overall experience is outstanding except camera quality.....at the first sight camera quality looks awsome but when you look at the details and when you zoom in quality starts degrading and looks like someone painted on canvas...but performance wise it is awsome at the price point it offers...😉

For the First time, I purchased a Mobile phone through Amazon. (Samsung Galaxy M30s ( Blue, 6GB RAM, Super AMOLED Display, 128GB Storage, 6000mAH Battery) Everything is fine except a little hollow space at both sides and backside of the handset.

Cameras are and Battery is OK. Fingerprints &amp; face unlock systems are NOT sensitively working comparing to Honor 20i and other handsets.

The overall performance are normally good. I hope it keeps performing well as required.
Thank you

Hi earlier i used to be on board with MI and other chinese brands, and was really looking to get out of that ecosystem but no good options were available in mid low range. But with this Samsung hit the nerve. Key factor will be the Software/features updates and after sales services. Big thumbs up to Samsung for this.

I really appreciate Samsung for making  this device  lightweight  because this device have a massive 6000 mah battery which gives around 2 days battery backup.  And completely charged in 2 hours and 20 minutes which good for 6000 mah battery.
And one ui 1.5 is  fabulous
Camera qwality is great it takes natural images not like other Chinese phone which gives auto edited photos and blurry photos.
Fingerprint is fast but not faster than other phones in this price segment
Device  gets little bit warmer while charging when fan and ac is off but I can't say it has heating problem.
 And night mode works very well.

Overall the phone is handy and amazing in its performance. However, the sound quality and camera performance disappointed me. The built quality of the device is not appreciable as the screen and polycarbonate back cover catches scratches pretty fast. If you want to avoid the scratches, you need to be meticulous in handling. As the device features the 6000mAh battery, the battery life will amaze you. A normal user wouldn't have to worry about charging the phone at least about one and a half days.

1. Front Camera Quality not Good.
1.1. In Video recording session we faced recording issue at the first time. We tried amazon technical support it is taken more than 10 days. very disheartened.
2. Sometime fingerprint not working(It is first read Face recognition then checking fingerprint.
3. Some Apps didn't support (ie: Like). It is closed automatically
4. Video call is good as well whatsapp call.
5. Sometime middle of the call voice fluctuation occur.

I ordered  Samsung  M30S on Sep 29 and I have received  Oct 1st. The camera  clarity  was  very  poor and I thought  this is not  branded  mobile, because  of  this camera and in this mobile need OS optimization, because battery drain very fast.  I have a doubt mobile  have a 48 megapixels camera. In one UI some features are not available like display notification and bixby.please  improve  camera  image  quality and above  mentioned issues via OTA update and then this good mobile for this price range. Otherwise it's not worth for this price.

This mobile gave a lot of time to say outdoors without worrying about charge point. This design was good for me to carry in the pocket and in hand.camera quality was good to capture vivid colorful and wide scene. Battery to 90/100 gives me 24hr to operate. Finger print reader was so quick as a blink of time. Picture quality overall operation and application starting and operation was fast enough.I have came across premium phones such as iPhone one plus they comes with heavy price but this mobile offered me a great benefits and satisfaction when I have less money and want good performer  .Thanks to Samsung you understood me.

The delivery by amazon is very safe and satisfying, the protection of the gadgets is also very cared. I liked the camera performance and I also had tagged  a photo of my pet in this  review. The fingerprint sensor is very nice working and I would like to improve  the brightness in slow motion and super slow motion and I can't  believe  the performance of this device's battery performance with 6000mah battery and it's  fast charging technology with its variant charger I like the product very much and I would suggest my colleagues to buy this product from AMAZON

I am really impressed by it's battery capacity and it's endurance of the battery it really awesome like I have charged 100% and then I started to play PUBG after playing 30 min the charge was 95% I was shocked I taught that it's new phone so It would perform well but till now 😅 it works in the same way and the video stability is very good and we can also shoot good photo and I really don't use finger print sensor because my face unlock is very quick than finger print scanner hence also it unlocks even at no light condition totally a good phone go for it......

The phone has a greater battry feels good in hand not heavy at all for the battry size, the display is greater the it has the true black screen where the colour balck in the display don't emit light. The changing is quick enough. The cameras are okay. good speaker output has Dolby atom so sounds are great on ear phones and external speakers. Medium Heating is seen only on long intance gaming. Over all if you multitask, and mobile is your go to device for work, Streaming and everything else this is the mobile you wanna go for.

Awesome phone at awesome price...Battery is really nice it lasts for two days on normal usage,camera is also nice specially night mode is too good,48mp is also fantastic..No heating issue till now,no hang,lags..Selfie camera is also great with various features,wide angle,slow motion, hyperlapse etc..Everything awesome...And most important the display looks so nice..Only one thing I don't like is back cover but that's not the big issue as we can purchase whichever is suitable..At last what else you want at such a low price and a brand like SAMSUNG.,so don't wait,,just buy one...#Go_Monster

1. Battery life is amazing (6000mah). I am an avid gamer as I play COD, Pubg very intensively. Despite a two or three hour gaming, the battery seem to decrease at an unbelievably slow rate. By the end of my gaming session, the percentage came down from 98 to just 62.
2. No lagging or heating despite heavy gaming (Pubg, COD) with full graphics on and it worked like a charm.
3. Multitasking works life a charm as the processor is able to handle whatever I throw at it.
Dislikes
Pretty much nothing as of now.

Verdict:
Go for it if you are much into performance more than how your phone looks.

Fingerprint  sensor  not working at all.
Battery drain like 4000mh or even less.
When you  buy new phone  its very disappointing to see such problems.
Very  disappointed  by Samsung.....

Also i want to replace this cellphone, but Amazon sucks....
Process is not completing at all ...
Asking  to call customers  care....

I call 3,4 times awaited  for 30 mints , but disconnected my call saying customers representative are busy......

What the hell I'm not customers....
I have done almost 1 to 1.5 lac  shopping through  Amazon  sofar...but such poor response  was not expected

The phone is really good. Battery life is fabulous. Once I charge it, there is no need for charging for 3 days. The speakers are very good, loud and clear. Display is very good. The camera is just amazing. Really crisp pictures in all conditions. Even night time photos are very nice. Definitely go for this product. At this price the amount and quality of specs you are getting is just amazing.

The Samsung Galaxy m30S is one of the best mobile phones you can buy in this price range....I love this product the most.What I like best about this is the camera quality. This is a Samsung phone that gives me the best camera compatibility I've ever used...The truth is, I carry it today like my own baby...The reason for this is the handheld that gives it..The super AMOLED display and other features of this device impress me...The only downside is that there is a slight a small delay in scanning the finger print and face id....Hopefully this will change with the next update....But honestly, I love this project so much.....#Loveusamsungm30s

Delivery  was on time.  This mobile is really a great and full with features. I am a Samsung fan but  I was using MI from last few years because of gang issues in sansung few years back. But now they have improved a lot more and Samsung UI will give you a great experience and features that you have not seen before in any other brands. SAMALOD display is a USP.. I suggest you to experience  it.

Overall awsome phone in this budget, battery life is great, display is outstanding.

Pros -
-seemless performance, no lag on moderate usage and gaming. I don't play heavy games so cannot comment on that.
-battery lasts 1.5 days on average.
-Super amoled display is flagship quality.

Cons
-mediocre camera, there are better cameras in this price range in realme, xiaomi etc
-charging time is very long, only 15 watt charger, it would be better if they had provided 30W charger.

Light weight,

Superb Battery Life as I have to charge it once in 2 days.

Soft Screen touch..

Using this phone since last 7 days, fantastic video quality. Slow motion with normal.

Atmos Sound effect with head phones. Comparison with any 3.5mm jack headphones or ear phones

Picture quality is perfect.

Finger print sensor accepts only 3 finger prints but works well.

Ultimately low budget with good battery life phone.

Been this phone for one a half months and I am really impressed with the battery life. The super amoled display is fantastic, really brings out the colors and the exynos 9611 does the job pretty well. Haven't seen any lag so far but yeah there's been little lags with playing games like asfalt. Seems this phone is not for heavy gaming. A feedback for the fingerprint sensor would have been nice and night mode on the camera could have been better. Hope Samsung comes up with updates for this phone. Overall a good phone media consumption and light gaming in this price.

I just picked up an amazing phone which is Samsung m30s and I'm so happy to make the right decision.
Talking about this phone, this comes with great battery life and I can strem all my favourite songs and play games without worrying that it may go off. The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. My friends take my phone and go on clicking selfies. I already have 400 plus photos in my gallery. The storage capacity is not a worry either, thanks to the 128gb varient.
The display is really very good. Everything so bright and nice. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I'm loving it! :)

I have being using this phone since a week, what I believe before using this phone was it will be same like old Samsung phones but it proved me wrong. The specifications it has ( 6GB + 128 GB, exynos 9611, triple camera set up of 48mp and 6000mah,  that's make it a #Monster), battery performance is exceptionally high, chipset is performing well without any kind of lag while playing games, aspect ratio of screen is speechless its gigantic screen with immense clairty and resolution. Phone gives a feeling of using a flagship phone with mid range segment price. I would suggest just go for it during this festive sale to get extra benefits.

This is having many issues . Build quality is too low which make it no longer usable. Camra quality is very poor . Description of product is so powerful but actually it has no sach quality. Its is only online , so you are not able to know how bad it is actually. Waste of money.

Their App also show that there is a problem in phone but still amazon don't believe us.

Kindly ask the local buyer about the this phone. Its has so many bad reviews and they all are true.

Looks great,  performance weak,
Camara not up to the mark,
 battery -normal 3000/4000 Mah battery is far more better than this.
No indicator for messages/missedcalls /battery charging indicator, every attempt you have to open the phone and check for missed calls/messages/battery charging.
Speaker is good.
In the music player with earphones,  if use pause button in the earphones cable,  song plays in the background in the phone. Player running in the phone but we can't hear the music.  You can not listen from the point where you paused the song.

All about my experience...

With minor use i am able to use it for 2  and half days after charging full battery...if not using much, battery can remain for a week...
Fingerprint sensor is good.
Camera quality is  fine.
As body is made of thin material so it is making tap-tap sound.
Super amoled display is good.
With normal charging-time taken to get full charged is about 2 hours 15 min(when i plugged charger battery was 30% approx).
With fast charging- it takes about 1hr 45 min to get full charged.

Overall it is good, i like it❤
That's all!

M30s is a wonderful phone with more battery life. I am charging it once in 2 days inspite of more usage of browsing. The uniqueness  of Samshng Amoled screen quality is awesome and once we get used to view videos on this mobile, we don't like quality on other brands. Second best feature is the pictures are real. It won't brighten the colors or background  like other mobiles do as I personally don't like edited pics. Opal black color is very decent color with 2 shades on the back.  I personally thought for 2 days whether to go with M30s or RealmeXT. As my preference is on video quality , and screen resolution,  I preferred M30s.

I have bought this mobile in Oct -2019 through Amazon &amp; with in 3 weeks started having serious problem. I was unable to make incoming &amp; outgoing calls many times. There was only dial tone &amp; phone hang up quite frequently. I have to restart every day to make it work properly. When approached customer care they casually said go &amp; contact service center.

Galaxy M30s is a great phone with sevral features it is available at affordable price.
Has type C fast charging,with quality cameras.
The battery backup is amazing i just charge my phone to 100% at it lasts an entire day(24 hours).
Face recognition and fingerprint security also works pretty well.
Its is also great and smooth for gaming and does not lag.
But color is not that impressive and i wish the opal black was all black and not blueish on the left,but It could be coverd by using cases and covers.
Overall its a hit phone.

Battery is really monster
 Screen :- Screen colors are crispy,
smoothness of screen is not up to the mark, while playing games I have to press 2,3 to start the function, same in call option
sound is loud enough
Camera:- day light photos quality is good and the wide moods are also nice but in low light specially in night qualities of photos are to shaky not uptown the mark.
Charging :- Charging is fast enough
Looks :- Big enough,  back is plastic made which is quiet disappointing, little bit heavy,
Fingerprint reader is not that much fast.

It's very difficult to manage this phone. Once if you do factory reset it becomes a useless device. Everytime you enter correct email &amp; password but this device says to login with the one which you registered. I entered same way but failed every time.

WORST PHONE I Have ever seen

I bought it during the sale so got the 128 Gb variant at around 13000+. So for this price i think it is value for money.
Battery life is excellent. With one charge you can easily go around 1.5 days with heavy usage. Charging is pretty fast too.
Camera has all the features you will find in any of the high end phone, quality is good enough for the price.
I have been using it for a month now and did not see it lagging or heating up.
Cons: Fingerprint scanner could have been better.
Overall with the new M series, Samsung is regaining the midrange market that it lost to Xiomi, oppo and its likes.

Wow Samsung never expected such a budet killer from you , every specification is above the price point,
there are some cheap Xiaomi phones with lots of adds and secretly taking the data out from us unknowingly,
Here about Samsung one UI and services are simple efficient and elegant
What should I tell then
1) super Amoled fhd display
2) 6000MAh monster battery
3) 48MP camera
4) Exynos 9611
5) and the price point 11,600Rs
(13999-1399-1000)
Finally that's the killer definition of a budget
Take a bow Samsung for your work on M30s for providing a quality product on the budget.

Samsung galaxy m30s is a flagship mobile. Packed with all the ultra smart features along with super design and build quality. Worth every single penny. All specifications have setup benchmark for its competetors under similar price range.
Fingerprint reader is highly responsive and detects the touch with lightning speeds.
Battery life is amazing. Lasts 2 days for normal use.

Camera quality can still be improved in the next releases. Picture attached is of dew drops on leaves

Fingerprint reader reads slowly... using pattern is better than fingerprint. Front camera is not satisfied. 1st recieived mobile heats 47°F bt i raise complaint customer support person said that the max threshold heat of  SAMSUNG M30s is 48°F so ur mobile working properly.  🤬 Then  I return that product &amp; then receive  another piece of that same product. 2nd received mobile also worst case. 😡😡😡😡😡Power button  placed inside than normal .doesn't working properly.... Charger itself mentioned that fast charging bt its charging slowly.im so disappointed 😒

Definitely worth more than its price. Samsung has gone out of the way in an attempt to make its stand in the market with this mid range mobile phone. Battery is very powerful. Mine is still 53% after full day use yesterday. Camera is wonderful and pictures are much clearer as compared to other phones (checked with office colleagues) with similar configuration. Though RAM is 6 GB but 2.3 gb is used by system. Looks wise it is good with its sleek design and different color variants (mine is sapphire blue).

Overall it is a really good choice to buy without any 2nd thoughts.

I was waiting for at least 1.5mnths, I was ordered bt delivery don't receive, product return to seller, I was unhappy sad bt still waiting, finally, product comes in stock then I ordered. And finally got it, I'm very happy. thank you, Amazon.
Samsung Galaxy M30s Pearl White 6GB/128GB is so pretty and looking so sexy also. Camera quality best ever, screen quality and brightness is matchless, the battery is too much good, I can't describe.

The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots. Additional zoom-out features for both front and rear camera is nice to have. I am really happy with battery backup as it lasts up to approx 2 days. Yes, approx 48 hours with medium usage including WiFi and GPS. The Ram Never Stop you from multitasking. PUBG running smooth with ultra HD mode.
Design, Touch, Look &amp; Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light.

The face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock. The processing speed is good enough for heavy games without much heating effect.

This is absolute Value for money .. as an user who likes the utility and easy usability I would rate this 5*.  5* for Camera, sound quality,  excellent  battery life , RAM.. when I got new phone ,out of 128 GB surprised to see 20 gb already used up..should be android and UI eating up 20 gb.. so 4* for storage .. one feature I see missing or not sure is how to block SMS from named senders sending spam messages  (like vm_abcd or qm-xym which i tried with Google's  help but the m30s block messages settings is allowing only contact numbers to be blocked ). Overall  , it's a value for money

This has become my main workphone, replacing even my laptop for my work. Great processing speed, casual gaming has been smooth. Sound output is also satisfactory. Though I haven't got the opportunity to test out the camera to it's ful potential, but it looks good for now, will try to review with sample photos in the future.

I bought 6/128 GB this week. performance is good but this phone does not give very royal look. specially cheap plastic back cover brings this phone in to Oppo Vivo level. Ear peice is not very good. overall ok product. I always recommend Samsung due to its after sales and services.

Bought this on first day sale. Utterly dissappointed with the camera quality. Redmi 7 pro has 100 times better camera.

Battery life is average. Xiaomi's 4000mah is better than this.

Thought of ditching xiaomi this time and buying samsung. Samsung will never be able to provide what xiomi provides in this price range

Truly said value for money.
I am using this phone since last 20 days This phone is awesome in this price range even a processor is also good. I really love it's battery life  which is almost run 2 days with normal use of internet and games . It's camera quality is very nice. Only an issue of its back panel which is not fitted well in some PCs like from finger print scanner little bumpy so it's like razor sharp edge so I request for replace and Amazon did it.
Overall the performance , battery and camera all these combination is very well in single phone.

Using this product from more than 2 months now and the battery life is really very good ..you can rely on this phone when you go out ..the screen quality is very good as it got the super smiled screen . The Canada quality is definitely amazing both the front and rear camera works amazing , fingerprint reader also works quite accurate ..if you planning to buy a new phone you should definitely go with Samsung company and this phone especially as it's super value for money and you can't get these specs in any other brand .

It's just one of the most interesting phone out in the market.
It's worth for the price we have  paid to receive  and use the mobile.
I have not faced any lag in the phone
It's been almost  2 weeks since  I started  using  this phone and its just amazing
The fingerprint sensor is just like feather touch it dosen't  take too much time to read you biometrics which also includes  the face recognition which is almost  as fast as the iPhone XR
I didn't  expect  the battery life of this phone to be this good but it take a little while longer to charge the phone

From camera is so bad .now a day every company focusing on selfie  cam , but I dnt know why such a big brand like missed out o really dont have any idea..

But entire phone feature depends on front camera.
So this M30s mobile is not upto the mark.

I suggest everyone go for offline models

It's all matter of good feature phone not a cheap rate mobile.
With cheap camera.

Thankyou

Spectacular Mobile Phone with Phenomenal Battery lasting for more than 3 days leaving worries aside along with Tensions of losing connectivity at the right time, Cameras and their captured images have made the memories live with greatest quality unmatched to any, the touch is so sensitive that it open the screen and looks at my fingers for next command, Finger Sensor is the best and rest assured of the faster responsiveness, Bluetooth, Wifi and Sim Signal never faced connectivity issues till date overall each and every penny got its return with this Mind blowing purchase.

In  samsung M30s  settings LIFT TO WAKE  ie., by lifting u can  turn the screen. But its  working to some extent. Earlier i  have Tecno Camon i2 with this more efficiently works.  However u can use double tap.
No Continuous video recording.
The screen is yellowish / mud like so all be like this. So screen is not paper white.

I never knew camera could be so good on a mobile.  Monster battery and lucid UI. It works fast and works for long time. I actually wonder what could people be buying for phones worth 60-70k
I prefer things this way - upgrade every year or year and half while enjoying the coolest features.
Thankyou Samsung

Advantages:
1)Good camera performance ,
 2)long battery life,
 3) immediate fingerprint response
4)this is the best mobile among others compared  with smaller budget.
Disadvantages :
1)Mobile is lagging  sometimes  when memory  was filled.
2)its display will collapse  when it falls due to weight and its sensitive glass.
But phone performance  is good compared  with other mobiles in these budget .

I give 4.9999 stars for it out of 5(iam giving  this ratings based on cost and performance  of all the mobiles )

Camera quality is not good , if it has 48mpl camera it must show , I compared it with Vivo camera Vivo is far better, shows real colors in pictures but not thi Samsung phone.
I want to buy vivo' Rs18k phone but don't see any replacement option on Amazon.
I faced the same replacement issue with Flipkart and I stopped purchasing from there but I think Amazon is doing same thing here like Flipkart.
Amazon at least have option to replace mobile phones 😠😠

Great buy for me. The battery life as expected is long. On normal, non-heavy usage, it lasts a good 2 days. Upon playing games and music, it lasts for full 1 day.
Camera quality is okay. Every shot lacks details upon zooming. Front camera quality is not good. Scene optimizer and best shot are two very good features of the phone.
Face unlock and finger print sensor are fast.
You get 4GB RAM out of 6GB RAM. Rest is used by the device Apps.
Overall it is a good value for money phone. I would definitely recommend it.

I am writing after extensively using it for full 2 days. Battery backup is excellent, it's been full 24 hours and my battery is still 30% left after extensive usage. UI is uber smooth giving lag free experience.  Disappointed with camera though, would suggest poco f1 if camera centric otherwise this is beast and lives upto the mark as per specifications.

Rear camera is above average but not great and the fingerprint scanner takes some time. Front camera is unable to focus and just average. Otherwise it's the best budget smartphone. No lags or heating issues, battery is great and lasts around 3 days for me with no major gaming and using with dark mode and low brightness. I bought it in the great indian sale for Rs.12500 with 1000 amazon pay cashback, so in totality it's great in accordance with it's price range.

Pros:
Battery life
Less heavy instead of holding 6000mah
Brilliant display
Crisp and clear pictures
Smooth OS
UI has been fantastic
Very good stability during video recording in any mode
Super slow Mo is really good
Gaming was also good with the brilliant AMOLED Display

Cons:
Night mode could have been bit more better but still that is too much to expect in this price range...

I have been using this fone for about two weeks now and have the following observations:
Pros:
- Touch is good.
- Picture quality is good.
- Sound quality is Good
Cons:
- Fast charging is a big let down. takes more than four hours to charge fully
- Camera quality is again a big let down and doesn't behave like a 28 MP camera.
- Night photos are awfully bad.
-  Face detection in low light conditions is a big let down again.
So for me a rating of 3/5, suffices for this phone.

It's a real monster I am experiencing  from last two days. Got delivery from Amazon as promised. As always Samsung done a very good job but at this price I was not expecting. Thank you Amzon for providing additional  cashback. One thing I noticed missing that none of accessories provided in box except charger. Samsung could add a simple TPU case in box. I will appreciate  Samsung for not using plastic bag for wrapping the box. We can say it's a ecofriendly  box. Thank you  Samsung and Amazon for  this wonderful  phone.

Its an awesome  product in this price range and it beats its competitors  in this price range by a huge margin in terms of the following things:-
1. Awesome  display
2. Smooth touch
3. Super fast fingerprint sensor
4. Super fast face unlock with different  angle and low light
5. Long lasting battery for the 1.5day heavy usage
6. Great cameras  both front and back with all the features  like slowmotion, steady  mode, lowlightpics, ultra wide angles both in front and back, pro feature , livefocus etc.
7. Gaming supercool and easy and all in th HDR mode.
8. Classy and outstanding  look.

I review any product only after using that product for some time.
After using M30s for more than 2 months
I have 3 words for the deal:
Trust = Samsung
Unbeatable = M30S
Best Service = Amazon
There are many companies who claim that their mobile phones have better camera, better RAM in that range
But in actual their performance decreases day by day, which is not found in Samsung products, it works same as first day.

I wanted a phone with excellent battery life, camera, with configuration of 6GB RAM and 128 GB ROM, within affordable price. Samsung brought the M30S in my range with all requirements which I needed. When compared with other mobiles, Samsung had an advantage of gorgeous look, so I bought this mobile. I clicked the pictures it was amazing. I continuously used the phone and battery drain was less, as compared to previous mobile. It has fast recharger which recharges within few minutes. Loved this phone very much and I recommend others as well.

1. First plus is the 6000mah batter. i charge 100% and leave the phone for 2 days. (mini 2 to 3 hours youtube, 100% 4g active, capturing video of my kid every day. )
2. Good sound, image clarity in day and night.
3. No heat issue, very fast charging and fast.

I am not interested in games so not installed gaming app. People go for it who mainly needs high battery life, camera clarity, fast and reliable.

Really happy to have this phone.

For me , this smartphone is one of the best devices i have often used regarding the battery life .Super Monster. Camera is also super good ,the Super steady mode is awesome . But From Cons side... it does not support 60fps .this has to get updated or improvement.
And i dislike about is that. The screen protection is very bad , though it doesnot comes with gorilla glass . But should be more comfortable than this. I Accidentally dropped( for 1st time)from my bed just about 1 feet and the screen crack. like the picture i have provided. Please Samsung you need to improve more in this issue.

Samsung Galaxy m30s is best of every department.
Camera 5/5
Screen brightness 5/5
Processor  5/5
In this price is best.
Also awesome service by Amazon.
Believe me guys sapphire blue is best, shining and good looking handsome.
My honest opinion.
If my opinion helpful give me likes.

Can't say worth for money bcoz it has so many features which we cant even imagine from Samsung to launch a model at this price. Camera quality is good, the night mode gives clear picture like we shot in sun light and slow mo and hyperlapse also avilable. AMOLED display and smoothness of the screen gives premium look. Long lasting battery.

After using 7 days, phone got stuck at some application like youtube, chrome and blancco and phone is not responding, when it got stoped working Navigation button also not worked and notification pannel is also stopped. Phone overheating so quickly. Don't buy this product. I'm feeling very regret.

Good thing that battery is 6000MAH but it take more than 2 and half hours for full recharge which we can't call as fast charging....looks handset charging module or adapter is not capable of fast recharge.
It should take some learning from one plus regarding what we call as fast charging.

Regarding camera, I am not sure how this is 64MP, camera quality is very bad
It should learn from vivo or oppo on how to deliver good camera.

Good storage and RAM of 6GB but again sometime getting hang even when just exploring mobile applications.

Fingerprint not working sometimes.

Overall this is very bad handset and won't recommend to anyone.

Hey Guys, I was a kinda guy who always had given preference  to other phone companies  rather Samsung but this time I took  chance  and I think I was bad at choice these samsung guys have made really a monster smart phone. In just 17k bucks numerous features are given. The most determental thing that it has 6000mah battery with type C fast Charging and trust me it gets charged 50 charged in 15-20 minutes. Screen look is too good Super Amoled. Coming to the camera I compared its camera with Oneplus 6T and I found it has more clear and defined pictures than a 40k bucks phone.
Searching a phone under 17 thousand buy this.

Phone screen is super and very good display.  Battery is also very good, with one full charge it lasts for whole day. Finger print reader is average and so is the charger. Battery charger is taking at least an hour to charge the 6000 mh battery. Camera is not matching this phone and is nothing more than average.
After all this Samsung Galaxy M30s can be called a good phone at this price and I don't like Chinese phones.

This product has the worst camera quality . This mobile has a 11.7 mega pixel camera but as per specification it sould be 48 mega pixehave never seen such a low quality phone. Heating issue is there the phone gets heated up while talking which is unbearable. Apart from that amazon has a very bad return policy. It took me 2 hour on phone to get the inspection procedure activated to get this phone replace .... I would say aa BIg No to buy priducts from Amazon

Then I contact Samsung service center they said this is online product we take 1st software then Hardware and after that this touch screen problem don't slove then we sorry we won't help you only bicoz this is online product
I request to all of you please don't buy this phone online. Offline is also available on Samsung shop.

The phone is excellent for battery. Very good Camera functioning in the lighten areas but not in the dark modes until you use tha flash light. No hanging issue compared to the old samsung smartphones. Easy multi tasking. Good phone to buy as it gives you a premium phone look and functioning as well. Display has been always a plus point for Samsung phones. Just it lacks is the Secure Folder option which was there in the J series phones in this price segment earlier.

After usage of 3 months I'm happy with this product.
Massive battery, good looking, decent performance, not efficient for gaming, great sAMOLED screen and one UI &amp; night mode is the icing on the cake. Weight distribution is surprisingly great, the best I must say.Thumbs up. Camera is decent and produces natural colour. But Samsung should be quicker for security updates.

👉The best of this mobile is that, Monster battery acts like a beast...if we use normally battery it comes for 2 days
👉Fingerprint and face lock both are acting quickly
👉Camera also looks 👍,for 🤳cam also I raise my 👍up
👉Back case having glassy look finish...I opted Opal black i think it's a new color(peacock shade)looks in different manner and sapphire blue and white are like regular... if anyone want to be unique then go for opal black👍👍
👉There's no slowdown of apps
👉I'm just chilling after getting this Monster mobile with such specifications for 11600/-🤗🤗🤗 because it's looks far reasonable

Pros:
Everything was really good.
No matter how much you use it it can last a day.
The camera was really good and I don't know why all these people complaining about camera quality. It may be their expectations of a triple camera.
I have been using it for a month and didn't had any lag or any other issues.
Display was amazingly superb.
Iam not much of a gamer. Tried pubg and other games. Handles it seamlessly. No heating issues.

Cons:
Turing airplane mode on and off tools some time. Not that much though.

Trust me guys you people don't understand what Samsung has achieved here.
This device proves that why Samsung is a top brand.
Everything about this device is awesome.
My very first device Samsung S3 for which I paid 31k rs back in the day. Now I must say for a price of 13999/- and discount of 1k for SBI easily wins my heart back to Samsung.
Proud of you guys.

Everybody is a gangster untill the true monster arrives . This quote truly matches Samsung.

The all new Samsung Galaxy M30s has a phenomenal performance that I've ever felt and experienced. The screen resolution has a unique quality of displaying the details in a pure grandeur way that it won't be an exaggeration if I say that the display has kind of 3D effect in its nature of reflection before our eyes and this thing has left me fully jaw-dropping at my first encounter. At one point, I am not that much of happy with its battery life though it has a 6000 mah potentiality but I won't say that I am not fully happy. It has to some extent that level of battery backup that it won't let you fully disappoint.

Incredible battery life! You need to charge it only once in four days? WOW! This is the dream I always had, not to bother to look at the charge left in the phone. Now it has come true.  It puts all other competition far behind. With such a huge battery one would expect a huge and heavy phone.. right? Not so.. it is actually slick and elegant. Lovely pictures! What a camera!!! Fingerprint reader is perfect security for such a wonderful piece of art.

Will giving this review after use of 10 days.
1st you can not say this phone has battery Samsung actually fit a transformer on it charge in 2hr and use for next 2day.
2nd screen is so smooth in Touch you can feel like its iphoneX.
3rd while watching 4k video its just awesome.
4th camera is also 2 good specially in low light.
5th games is running like butter its so smooth.
Even phone have 6k battery still you feel phone is very light weight.
Best phone in current market in this price range go for it . . .

I'll keep it short and sweet.

Camera: Good, night mode and wide angle works great. This phone has super slow-mo which is really night.

Display: SAMOLED, no question about it. It is bright and colors are perfect.

Battery: Monster battery with 6000 MAH. Moderate to High usage will last for 2 days, if very heavy usage with games like PUBG, Asphalt, COD, will work for 1 day. Type C with Fast Charging is an added benefit

WiFi and Network: Works perfect

Over All I can give it 4.5/5.

A branded phone one must purchase.

I purchased 6gb,128gb for Rs. 14300. For that price it's the perfect phone. I have also used Galaxy M10 and they have really upgraded everything.
The display (AMOLED is just amazing). Color is good and phone is stylish including the corner curves which are perfectly balanced. Touch is smooth too. Speakers are good although only 1 set on the bottom side.

Android latest version with a good processor.

If if costs you somewhere around 15-16k, do buy it.

The only con i found is:
Camera quality is not upto the expectations as 48MP should be.

I am using this phone for last 1 week battery is awesome, if you are buying it for battery its a perfect option for you but at some point i m pretty disappointed... The output sound quality of earphone is below average, even i am using sony earphone it's not that good.. look wise its not a good choice.. and i am noticing some problem in my headphone jack for last four days... While listening song if the jack moves even a little bit voice gets corrupted that doesn't feel good... I've raised a complain... Hope they will resolve it...

I was looking out for a budget phone since last few months. I checked out a few &amp; realised that I would have to compromise on one thing or another - either battery life or Camera quality or performance or display or storage or something or the other.

Then I came across Samsung Galaxy M30s &amp; to my surprise I didn't have to compromise on anything &amp; got all that I wanted &amp; much more.

It's Awesome Camera quality, Durable Battery life, Powerful Performance, Spectacular Display and Abundant Storage fulfilled all my requirements.

Thanks Samsung for this, all in all, Marvelous Cell phone

Bought 4 + 64 Gb version. The Amazon delivery is fast and arrived on time.
Pros.
The build quality is very good.
The sAMOLD display is stunning  and pleasing to eye.
With medium usage of calls, video and surfing battery is coming for two days. Huge improvement in battery area.  Used On7 Pro with 3000 mah battery at 172 gms. Compared that M30s is having 6000 mah in 182 gms.
Finger print  works fast.
The main camera day light pictures are suburb an has many setting options. Low light option gives improved pictures taken at night. The auto focus works with out lag.
Overall good phone.

Super all rounder performance mobile phone

48 mp camera
Super amoled screen
4gb ram 64gb storage

Also super value for old mobile
At last I got no cost emi of 6 months as well
Super purchase

So below 12000 it costed for me
Value for money
From a trustable and top brand like Samsung

It was a defective piece which I received and there's been no replacement as well despite raising the request on time and the amazon technician checking the device and telling me to replace it. My SIM stops working abruptly and incoming calls don't got through. Only on restarting the phone again SIM starts working. It was perfectly fine in my previous phone. There's been no communication from amazon on the same and still trying to figure out how to gt it replaced.

This is one of the best mid range handset from samsung. This is my first samsung set. Usually I buy mobile after a thorough research and this time I opted for Samsung m30s. Camera quality is extremely good with wide angle, night mode &amp; slo mo option. But what makes it worthier than other brand is it's 6000 mah battery. I work in a financial sector and I need to be connected with wifi &amp; bluetooth headset almost 16 hrs a day. This giant battery gives me 2 and half days back up after a single charge. Can you beleive it? I got more what I had asked for. I am complete happy with this set.

I wanted to buy a smart phone in this Great Indian Festival, but I did not have a plan to buy Samsung phone. I never was interested to buy Samsung. Then I saw Samsung M30s and I fall for it. I couldn't resist myself.
I guess it is the best phone on this price with these many of awesome features.

It's one of it's kind. I mean latest exynos 10nm fabricated processor at this price, it's just ice on the top of cake. Powerful camera, battery. Brilliant screen which gives you the feel of very expensive phones. Gaming mode is brilliant. Camera shows what you can see with real eyes, what I mean is it shows the exact colors of what you capture. There are so many new functionalities that I haven't seen in all the old phones I had. Design also is brilliant. Sensors like face recognition and finger print sensor are really fast. All in all, it's the best you can buy under 15k but still can flaunt it like it's some 30k phone.

Using for 1 week. 1 day charging now changed to once in a 2 days. Camera extra for this price range. All those blue phones for even ordered black. Those are some bluish black colors make diff. If you want something to worry just put fingers between volume n power button to hear/ feel some quality tradeoffs. Otherwise all fine. Happy Happy.

This phone is awesome. I am getting battery life of 3 days approx under normal usage with 4G data running ON eveerytime without power saving mode.
I have never seen this long of battery backup on any smartphone.
After my purchase, I recommended this product to my relatives and we then purchased 3 more phones in family...
It's the best phone...

Till now I have not seen any Con or negative point in this phone as per its price is concerned.

I am happy with the product recieved. Writing review after 5 days of use.
Camera: Really good 48mp primary camera. I liked the wide angle view very much.
Battey: A monstorous battery with fast charging. Battery backup is really good.
  Display is also nice. Recommended for those who read. Able to read with less strain. It may be due to the bigger display.
  I am happy with the fingerprint reader and smart lock.
Overall very happy with the product recieved.

First of all.. Iam telling about its SUPER AMOLED display. Display is FaabulossS.
Before I buying this M30s I have a Redmi Note 7 Pro. But... I need a Samsung's mobile which have sAMOLED. So I choose this. When M30s compared to Note 7 pro, Note 7 pro is better...
But M30s is also a good performer.....
Anyway.... I like this M30s

Design &amp; build quality  -  7/10
Display  -  10/10
Camera  -  7/10
Battery  -  8/10 (performing like 4500 mAh)
Performance  -  8/10
Sound quality  -  9/10
TOTAL  =  8/10

Earlier I was using oneplus6. I gave it someone else bought this m30s after watching plenty of online reviews. Now after using this phone for three days. User experience not at all good. You get annoyed to make simple call. You need to enter multiple buttons to make simple call. Keypad so big that it hides what you typing. Biggest gimmick is its cameras. 48mp camera is like 8mp camera. And front facing camera is like 2013 old micromax mobiles.  I suggest not to buy if you think it's good camera mobile. Go for redmi note7 pro or realmext. Amoled display  and battery backup are the only two things I liked in this mobile.

Samsung galaxy M30 one of the best smartphone in this range and competitor to high end phones too.
Massive battery and almost two days of battery life is really impressive. Tripple rear camera is really impressive which gives shots with great depth and picture quality and colour perception. Front selfie camera is also best in this range. Now coming to the screen 6.4 inch tear drop notch is really impressive, full hd+ display gives good quality videos/ movies experience. Build quality is also good with dual shade colour.
Overall best phone under 20K range :)

Best battery life in recent phones, after purchase I have never run out of battery. Camara quality is also good but night photos are being issue some time. The same way fingerprint sensor sometime irritates you by not working, but at the same time face unlock is very active and you will not face any issue for fingerprint sensor as your phone is already unlocked by face detection. Further we all know about AR emojis, which is a great feature in this range of phones. All other features are good and no any issue while using it.

Pros:
1 elegant design  and classy looks
2 Camera is excellent ❤, triple back camera  result is awesome,  night, pro, slow motion is excellent. Camera captured in details
3. 6000mh battery is last long, 2 days for normal  use.
4. Network reception is good
5.6.4 inch samold awesome display.
6 sound is very good.

Cons:
1. Spammy notifications
2. Full battery charging time ~2hour

Final Verdict:
No such complaint at this price point, Amazon  provide this phone 11600rs with discounted  price. It is better to compitter other phone realme 5 pro and mi a3🙂🙂

The best thing about this phone is 6000mah battery that it comes with. As I'm not a heavy user, for me the battery ends in about 24hours. It is pretty fast as well.
However, there are some downsides as well.
fingerprint reader is so slow that I have to put my finger few times on it to unlock, facereader is not quite accurate and Camera quality is inferior; Pictures taken always seem unreal to me.
I think Camera of this phone is something that Samsung really have to work on.
For me,in mid range this phone is perfect as I don't  want go for Chinese phones.

This phone is brilliant.
Camera is very good. Even the front camera is great. Battery is stellar. 2 days of backup. Fluid experience. No lag. No heating issues. Fast charger included in the box. Camera has almost all the features such as slow motion, super slow motion, hyperlapse, all those modes. Display is 10/10. Speaker quality via the loudspeaker is very loud, yes very loud and clear. Build quality is 8/10. Call and network reception quality is great. Supports 2 band wifi with the latest bluetooth. Go for it, it's the best you can get from samsung. A branded product is 1000 times better than a Chinese product

The phone is very good compared in this price range.

The fingerprint reader is flat on the back so it is sometimes difficult to find and there is a minor lag the phone is unlocked.

Camera quality is very impressive in natural light it requires some work during artificial light.

The battery life is simply superb in this mobile even for a heavy user like me I am getting an one and half day battery life.

The only problem I find in the phone is it doesn't come with a back case.
It's very difficult to find a proper back case and things in online doesn't fit.

This is such a scam.this model is only available in online..I am from UK.. I bought this phone nowhere it has mentioned that it can be used only for Indian sim...I haven't opened the box...I called Amazon..they denied to take this phone back..my advice is that once u buy this you will be stuck with this junk...I had always been a fan of Samsung and had been called as brand ambassador of Samsung by my rally and friends...I never expected something from Samsung like this...n amazon ...I just wasted my 17000...N my 10 days vacation waiting for this.

This all new phone from Samsung is worth the money. I ordered during the sale and it was delivered within 2 days. Amazon always Amazes with lighting speed of delivery. The phone has all high end features comparable to much more expensive handsets..in this category and at this price I think it is going to be a trend setter. Great job done by Samsung to provide a phone with latest technology and features in such a less price segment.

Overall a nice phone. Nice sapphire blue color, which gives rich look to the phone. Battery life is long. However, the back of the phone is made up of plastic, and they have also not provided any body / back cover and the screen guard. The buyer has to pay 500-600 rs to get these installed on phone, which indirectly increases the product price. This could have been avoided by providing the body / back cover and the screen guard in the product box.

Much more improved performance when compared to M30.
Everybody knows this phone is battery beast.
I'm a moderate user so this phone performance is okay for me.

It needs camera improvement. Hope Samsung will fix this issue by giving software update.

Super mobile standard display, long battery back up of one and half day with high usage, camera is super as it gives original colors shades and main point is its weight distribution doesn't feel that you are using 6000mah battery smartphone. I am not that game freak but my friends do play pubg it supports the best without any heat issues , and i didn't  mention any network issue's by both sim work well.
Samsung m30s could have provided security app lock.
If you look for brand and beast smartphone this is the right choice. Go for brand m30s

I used many phone in last few years mostly xiaomi but now i feel Samsung is best due to its software oneui. I had mi note 8 pro which has 64mp camra but at the time of video recording i saw that mi phone does not maintain exposure its become white at more light but in this m30s exposure is well maintained.
Gaming experience is best in both mi and Samsung.
There is no overheating issue.
The best part is its display and battery its just awesome 😘

this has various network and connectivity issues the bandwidth never goes beyond 1-2 mb where the same network in the other phones goes upto 8-10, the wifi reception is poor it doesnt connect when moves to the next room, the Bluetooth intermittently disconnects. highly disappointing phone , since these issues took time to understand the return period was over and i needed to get rid of the phone by selling in cashify and there by loosing 4k in depreciation for a 2 month old phone. avoid this phone if you want peace of mind

Only thing i didnt liked was build quality instead of plastic Samsung should have used some other material. The charger and cable supplied with box looks duplicate, it seems Samsung has compromised with quality while making phone at such low cost, they are competing with Vivo or Oppo or Xiaomi but build quality wise or with quality of supplies Vivo or oppo or Xiaomi are far better. Camera of this device is good. Its good but not as best as most of tech reviews on YouTube are claiming.

I am using this product for more than a week. I find camera quality a bit low compare to other phones. Also I feel there should be software updation giving some features like app lock, music player and video player within the system as I've to install separately.

What I like in this phone is digital wellbeing. It helps the user to control timer on spending overtime in social apps.  Also I feel uniqueness in Samsung mobiles apart from above mentioned drawbacks. Love you Samsung!  Hoping best in future.

One of the best budget smartphone in the market currently. I have already recommended this and the person has purchased this model.

Boy o Boy, what can I say about this piece of tech. I bought it for 11800 with exchange and card offer ( exchanged my lyf phone).
Been using it for about a week now, no issues whatsoever  had to charge twice only.
Picture quality is great. It's a wholesome experience to watch a video.

For this much price one can not hope to get a better phone. For people who need battery  backup this phone is for them. Don't care how camera is or it had infinite features in it.
Considering the part played by phone is daily office routine this phone god sent.

Fingerprint reader is slightly slow. Camera quality is ok, but not excellent. Battery feels like 5000mah, 6000mah is not effective. Very poor battery management.  Battery  charging with 12watts only and after it will become 9Watts, none of the time 15watts comes.

Performance of the phone is very good with 4GB Ram. Customized OS but good to use.
Display is at it's best for this segment phone.
Battery back up is good. But little less than expected as it was a 6000 mah.
Camera is much less than expected.48MP should have much more clarity. Should have more clarity when the pictures are zoomed in.
Few Samsung's own apps are good to use.
If Samsung's malware/privacy protection is also included it would be the best to buy in this segment

A really good device with an excellent battery life.Despite my heavy usage I charge my phone only once in two days and it still goes on.The camera quality is also really good.The 48 megapixels camera really gets the work done.The fingerprint is also way faster than than the Samsung a50s onscreen fingerprint sensor.The gaming in this phone is also pretty smooth.Overall this phone is a must buy under this price range.

I'm using the M30s from past 1 week. The phone is amazing. It fulfills all the promise it made.

Camera both Front and Back- Best pictures.
Battery - 6000 mAh - runs with all the apps (FB/Whatsapp/Office 365 and my work apps) for 2 days straight without the need of charging.
Dolby Atmos with earphones is another feature and the sound is loud and clear (tried with different ringtones and songs).
4GB RAM - no lagging or slowness felt.
FingerPint Reader - the response time is minimum.

As I said its the True Value for Money. Love this one..

Being a super craze for the blue color n shades of blue, is the only reason I  bought this mobile phone. Now I  am totally impressed by the product. This is my first smartphone with Samsung. Loved the super fast charging and wonderful battery life, which is better compared with other brands. One of the best phones which has the option of taking slow motion videos. Exploring new options daily with this phone. Good phone with great features n burger friendly too.

You must be impressed by the specs they shown you. But please don't buy this phone it's  just waste of money. The specs shown are not even close to real world performance. Within a week phone runs likes its a year old.
Conc:-1. Processor is not capable. Snapdragon 660 is better than this exynos 9***
2. My Xiaomi  phone with 4000Mah battery is more efficient than this 6000maH battery.
3. Cameras are not that good.
4.Plastic cover is not included in box.
5. Poor ram mangement.
6. And many more

Pron:- Smoother Nice screen.

Don't let the specs deceive you. This is the weakest phone I ever used. Pls consider protection also into consideration. They also gave me a cracked peice. My phone fell from a knee height on a non rough surface and one crack. 😭😭 So please consider protection. Once it will fall for sure. Also the polycarbonate case was very weak. The top left was already there😒

I have used this phone about 3 days i found it very nice and good. Things i like in this phone is it’s BatteryLife, Camera and performance which is very good at this price of range. Fingerprints is really good and sensitive and face recognition is also pretty good. Now lets talk about which thing i don’t like.
Headphones are not included in the box.
Charging cable is really short that annoying me.
Anyway overall this phone is good for mid range and daily usage. I would recommend this to everyone.

I liked the most about this mobile is it's powerful battery. Once charged you can use it for 36 hours at a stretch in normal life like me. Even after using 36 hours this mobile still left with 20 percent battery. That'samazing for me.(My usuage of mobile includes calling ,receiving numerous calls,sending and reading emails,watching YouTube and spending sometime in social media. )Overall i am satisfied with this mobile &amp;whoever has the same kind of usuage of mobile then I would recommend him/her for this mobile.

Ok mobile.
Sound is not loud while playing music, Dolby Atom sound works only with earphone and not on its speakers.
Camera as said of 48 MPs is not that good,  its ok.
Battery is ok,  does drain fast,  have to charge twice a day to 90% just for calls and videos via earphone.

Can't complain about display,it's amazing and probably the best in this price range,camera quality is neither bad nor very good,it is okay....camera quality at outdoors is quite good...you have to use any other app for better selfies....battery is 6000mah but acts like 4500mah....giving one day backup after moderat use.....talking about gaming,playing asphalt 9 on high graphics quite smoothly,there are some minor lags and frame drops although it's playable comfortably.....so overall phone is good....snot recommending this phone for selfies...

Not good battery  back up according to 6000mAh. I have replace mobile but still 3rd camera is mismatches around circle border. Black space around screen are more than showing  in photos in Amazon advertise. And not working as fast as 4GB ram. But camera result good enough. Display is excellent. And almost good in price.

This mobile has world third class network section..It has also very bad connectivity both wifi and network section.Its 5 ghz connectivity has very poor distance capacity.So I have sold the mobile only 10000.Though it has replacement policy but there is no option for refund.I have ordered another unit but that has also same problem.Don,t buy Samsung m30s.And also don't say about its build quality.

I Purchased Samsung for the first time and I am very happy to buy this product. I am photography enthusiast so camera of this M30s is perfect for me.
Go ahead if you are planning to buy. Best phone in this budget.

Few best thing to highlight.

1. Finger Print is so quick.
2. Outstanding Camera.
3. Very Smooth and user friendly.
4. If you travel this is for you because battery will last for almost 02 days.
5. Last but no the least - Slim and Handy.

I have ordered m40s on 21 Jan 2020.
The display quality is far superior than  redmi realmi phones since super amoled display type.

And if you are not heavy game user then exynos 9611 processor is good one.

And the main reason to buy this phone is 6000 mAh battery power. Since in last used phone I have seen serious battery issues.

Camera is ok not bad

And 6 Gb variant comes to 15000 / RS.
So I think this is value for money smartphone

The galaxy m30s has folling pros and cons

Pros
1. Huge battery life. Even if you play games, and do a binge watch on Netflix for entire day. This will never die for around 2 days.
2. The weight doesnt feel as could have been for a 6000 mah battery phone
3. Good color combo on back panel
4. Awesome oLED screen

Cons
1. Biggest con is the battery charging. It takes minimum 4 hours to fully charge the phone even with fast charging.
2. Camera is good but expected more from a 48 MP. Not as sharp as it should be

Its just awesome phone I bought it for my dad and he loves it better battery life and no lag in the phone the camera is the highlight it takes beautiful shots. Been using from a while and there is no problem of overheating did gaming as well but when playing at ultra high graphics it get hot near the camera. Caution:please note that this is not a glass back so the temperature fits directly on the carbon fiber. Warning: please use a back cover and screen guard.

This phone is just awesome... Used this phone for a while and didn't have to charge for more than one and a half day. SAmoled display gives you amazing feel of the phone and provides you vivid colors. Back camera works great in outdoor conditions and indoor too.. front camera is not upto the expectations .. front camera misses details in indoor conditions... Although its fine , 6000 mah battery and light weighted what more u can get in this amount. I loved it !!

The battery life is excellent, very good for people who do most of their work via phones.
The finger print reader is also nice. The auto brightness adjusting function works good.Great shooting capabilities,Smooth performance,Immersive Super AMOLED display.Night mode isn't that good,Selfie shooter could've been better. Overall, the device leaves a lasting impression as a capable all-round offering that doesn't compromise on essentials.
And overall it's really value for money in it's category of 4gb ram and 64gb inbuilt memory and also it has and super 500+ external gb support. Overall rating 4.9/5

No other company (including Samsung) has ever launched such a feature loaded, high performance, handy, classy looking phone in Indian Market in such an amazing Price.

Unlike my last phone, I had fully charged it  yesterday afternoon and after 24 hrs I am left with 58% battery.

It is lightening fast, swipe is better than other overrated ultra expensive phones, and looks are awesome.

Screen resolution and size is heart throbbing.

Highly recommended to all. It will be the best buy.

I don't like product, I was thinking Samsung will going to be introducing new experiences for customers. Network issue with the mobile many times I have found mobile not able to receive network. Before it I have used vivo in basement I  have full network with voda but with this mobile same sim but network lost many time in a day needs to restart.. lost my money.

Samsung said 6000 Mah batteries, must work two days but works only 24 hours. And charger is not fast enough...

Detailed Review:

Camera: The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots.

Battery: I am really happy with battery backup as it lasts up to approx 2 days. Yes, approx 48 hours with medium usage.

Design, Touch, Look &amp; Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light.

The face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock. The processing speed is good enough for heavy games without much heating effect.

Super amoled display is great. No issue in viewing angles.

Overall build quality is not the best..
Compared to other Chinese phones camera quality is good not the best ..
I love the display quality for this price is best I have seen..
If you need all day long  battery this is the best smartphone in market I'm using since 2 months i never run out of batteries because I'm using GPS along with data without offline
I never noticed heating of hand set while playing pubg are streaming video
But I did noticed while watching tik tok phone is heating so don't use tik tok on this phone

I think  I have written everything what I have noticed in my new Samsung Galaxy M30s

Best midrange Samsung phone.I got the phone in 10,034 INR on diwali sale(10% SBI debit card discount and exchanged an old phone).
Camera quality is awesome,
The battery lasts for about 2 days,
Performance is awesome,
The display is very good I love the display of this phone,
UI is smooth and its nice,
The fingerprint is fast,

One advice from my side to everyone...plz don't forget charger of this phone ever whenever you go out of town for more than 1 day bcoz its very difficult to find Type C charger.

Awesome product.
The main attraction is its  triple rear camera setup. Crisp photos. Backed up with slow mo videos. Selfie camera also seems fine but as usual not comparable to the rear ones.
Amoled screen allows wide viewing angles with beautiful color contrast.
Battery life is good but i did not experience a huge difference owing to its 6000 mah performance. But its bit better than 4000 mah ones as expected.
Did not experience any lag in software issues till now. Call quality is not bad either.
Among the cons, the polycarbonate back makes it evident as a mid range phone.

I am very impressed with this device, the camera quality is amazing as well as it's super steady mode, even if we shoot video while off roading, as a pillion then to its steady mode makes the video extremely smooth and especially the slow motion camera and its quality is on another level, video quality is very sharp and bright. It's super amoled display makes the device more attractive and premium. Its 6000 mah battery life, even if my day starts with 45% battery, I can use it whole day long. Gaming on this phone is the best, without any lag or anything. I love this this phone overall. #gomonster

I have issues in Touchscreen not working some time and his fingerprint touch also not working some time he takes 2-3 time to get unlock

I have also a issues against amazon, They provide cash back offer at the time of purchase but after receiving the product they change their all policies and don’t allow to customer take cash back offer due to some other criteria they wrote after the sale of product. This was so cheap by amazon and I am totally disappointed from amazon service which they are trying to cheat with the customer 😡😡

It's a wow smart phone from Samsung.
I have a doubt about the processor but it's  very good, but can be improved. Display is fantastic.Cameras..you can't get such quality in this price. Battery life is fantastic. Front camera is very very nice. I am satisfied.

Battery is really good. Camera quality is not worth of 48MP. It should be very less than that. When you zoom the pixels are breaking and night mode is worst. Larger screen is good while watching movies. But the weight is bit more than normal, you can't use it in one hand support.

I never expected this from Samsung brand as camera quality of this phone is pathetic..even other brand are far better than this ..so if I say I have 48mp camera so my expectation would be more but after looking to this I would never try for samsung phone.even the battery on single day it's goes off .so only with look of phone i m very happy rest i would say waste of money..so please don't buy this phone better go for other mobile brand

The phone is amazing and live up to its price. Samsung has corrected the only blunder of their phone, that was battery  backup. I am eminent net surfer, ans this battery is just the right one for me.
Camera is pretty good.
Sound quality is also nice.
Body of the phone is sleek, and colour gradation  on back looks amazing.
Battery can go upto two days with moderate internet and video surfing, phone calls.
Processer makes the work more smooth. No lag till date even on using multiple apps.
All in all.. go for it. Amazing phone in smart budget.

This phone is beast in all the terms , battery lasts 2 days of full charge after normal and some heavy gaming too like pubg , the gaming performance of this is too good , no lags in play during pubg at high graphics HDR and ultra , frojt camera is ok ok , but rear camera dynamic range is awesome , best phone to buy in range of under 15k , don't  ever go for redmi or realme let theie specifications attract you , but samsung one UI is farr better than realme and oppo and vivo company's. Display quality is SuperAmoled , and full hd display , so al the informations looks crisp and clear...Go Fo Monster...

✓✓ It does not have EIS but Super Steady mode is impressive. It can record 4K videos, Super Slow-Mo and Hyper lapse,

Unbeatable........ It gives you best battery backup. I do not need to charge my phone for more than 1.5 day s on regular use.
Phone comes with Android +Samsung UI which is good and editable as per personal use. It comes with fast charging USB C port with fast charging adaptor in the box unlike MI A3 where u have to purchase fast charger separately and even battery capacity is less.
The Camera quality is good even in low light with various modes.

As per my experience Samsung M30s is best Smartphone in this category.

Fingerprint reader is good
No words for Camera
7 out of 5 rating
Battery life wont make you feel one should charge his handset, it has an insane 6000mAh supply, back up and dont worry
No phone in this section can beat this. Gamers have a tendency to prefer SD processors, but being an electronics major, I can assure you, you can rely on exynos.
I couldnt find out a single "lacking" from amazon, and all its premiumness boosted long by its 6000mAh belly.
In one sentence, its a premium one in the budget section.

It's an awesome phone. Considering the price you'll get a complete and value for money device. SuperAMOLED screen is gorgeous to look at and it feels premium. Camera takes good pictures but you can get better results in 48MP mode. Front camera is also good. OneUI is refreshed and smoother than the previous generation Samsung's UI.

Its is a best phone i ever used, after 3 days of using i found that it is a best phone in this range.
1.battery is powerfull-2days backup and 12hrs(continuous)backup in heavy use.
2.camera is little average but some camera features are excellent which makes it unique.
3.charging is slow as it have monster 6000mah battery
Network speed,voice call,speaker is just amazing.
Overall if you will buy it you will love it.

Samsung should give an update for this phone to add some gestures(palm screenshot is not good) and new features.

The battery life is exceptional.easily get through 2 days of usage.display is superb,with amoled screen every text, photos,videos looks pretty sharp.perfomance is descent and can be compared to sd660 series.it can easily handle games with average settings.Camera is good but have better options from other vendors for the same price.
Fast charging helps to get a quick boost in case of emergency and for fully charge the device it take more than 2.5 hrs

After using for 3 weeks, I did not found many issues while operating the phone. I have 6 gb and 128gb variant.

The issue I faced is with this phone is the ram management and few with camera post processing which can be sorted out by is updates.

The build quality is not so good and you have to use protections for both back and screen.

But overall features vs. The price is good with the branding of samsung.

Finger print reader is not as promised. It takes 2 to 3 retakes to sense.
Camera of my old infinix phone which is 12 mp captures more crisp &amp; clear images than your 48 mp camera. Focusing is not good at all.
Battery is 6000 Mah but works as 4000 Mah. My infinix battery which is 4350 Mah gives more backup than your 6000mah. Not as promised.
Gets over heated very fast on top side which is not good sign for a samsung brand. My infinix phone does not heat even after heavy tasking.

This is a product for specially budget customers.The camera is fantabulous. All its features are awesome, super slow mo,stability videos ..Dedicated memory card slot makes 32 GB variant also great..Icing on the cake is the screen..OLED is just the ideal next gen screen for all..If u are gifting ur parents its just exact as I did..

Phone looks very sleek. Screen display is much better than the equivalent models of other brands. Camera quality is excellent. I am wary of using fingerprint reader so don't know about it but touchscreen commands are very easy to navigate. Battery life is good. It charges fast and does not get heated up. With 128GB internal storage and 6GB Ram I feel super rich for storage and operation. In addition you can enhance it with SD card too. With dual sim you can use two different sims in this phone without worrying about enough memory for all the apps. Good value for money!

I'm not a tech savvy guy but when I heard about Samsung Galaxy M30s from a friend, I was very fascinated seeing the phone. I really liked the phone's looks and the colour (Sapphire Blue😍) and made up my mind to get it in the sale. I booked my phone at 4am and I was damn happy about it. All thanks to Amazon for delivering the phone in 2days, and I was awestruck after unpacking the phone.
Honestly, the phone was much more fantastic than I expected and it was worth my money. The battery life is super awesome and the 6.4inch screen makes my Netflix time much enjoyable. Thank You Samsung and Amazon 😊

Good display, superb camera quality, new Samsung one ui is also nice and much faster. More impressive with the batttery part. If you charge 100% it works for 2 days. So i need not have to charge on daily basis and need have to worry while travelling a long distance. This handset is really match with its tag line "GoMonster"
This is the first time i have bought Samsung handset, its really good and fully satisfied with all the features present in the handset. This is the best product in this budget as compare to other products present in the market with all the features.

The build of the phone is very pathetic... I mean afterall the back is plastic... But u can hear sounds of plastic bending when pressed... There UI is bit laggy and dull ...... The fingerprint sensor is the worst...and u can only store upto 3 fingerprints...... everything else is fine.....

The overall experience of this product is pathetic compared to what they potray while selling, all the claims are falsified.

The Monster phone they say:

The camera sucks. You can buy any other phone for same budget and still get superb camera quality.

Processor: i was running Pubg And COD and device gave up, the launch time to play screen for Pubg is 2.5 minutes. The game on this device lags a lot, a lot..

Battery: Sure thing, this is monster and nothing else.

Conclusion: Not WORTH

Pros:-
Voice quality is great
Display is awesome , touch is good
Cons:- camera is not upto mark and it just shows 48 MP but quality is not with that standard, Note 7 pro has better camera quality
Its response time is little high and after 20 days buying phone gets hang sometimes.

At first I gave it a 5 star, but things got worse. Second day itself phone restarted all of a sudden. Then when I tried playing pubg it kept restarting 5 mins after every game. Things are getting worse, now it restarts few seconds after the game starts. It sometimes restarts even when I'm using YouTube. Amazon allows only 10 days returns. I realized it today, after 20 days. Delivered on Oct 6th. No idea what to do now. I don't know if anyone else is having this issue, but I definitely wouldn't recommend buying this phone. It's my first Samsung and I regret it.

5- clean and cleaar speaker n calling both.

Corn-

build quality
Face unlock in low light
No case inside box n no earphone

The battery life is obviously absolutely amazing and charges pretty fast too. I love the display... Classic Samsung. The gesture switch between recent apps is also great. There are mainly two downsides to this phone in the time I've used it.
1. The Pro mode of the camera. You cannot set shutter time which makes long exposure photograpby(which I personally love) really really pain to me.
2. There is a bit of plasticy feel to the device. But that doesn't really matter because you'll anyway end up using it with a cover and glass guard.

It's the complete package ! With the 6000 mAh battery and 4 gb ram ,I can run ultra graphic games on this phone without any worries about battery. And more over the camera makes me look stunning in every click , And the fun part is it can charge itself super quickly with the fast cable charging option and the blu light filter protect my eyes all day.... the list goes on ! I never knew a phone could do all this at such a low cost. Using it for months now and there ain't a problem. If you wanna get a new phone .... go for the m30s.

1) best battery, i do get almost 2 days with it and it is not so heavy
2) good camera u can shoot in super slow motion, also u can shoot in super steady  mode, 60fps video recording is lagging but considering  price it is more than that
3) awesome  fhd plus super amoled  display( i purchased  mainly  because  of this)
4) i dont play much games i didn't got any problems with the processor  till now
This review  is enough  to buy this phone under price range

First time using Samsung brand mobile and writing this review.
Looks wise I liked opal black color , amoled screen for watching high resolution videos,
48mp camera using which I clicked some pictures which're cool as I expected ... also internal memory 128gb resolved my issues of copying data frequently to my laptop and finally with massive 6000mah battery which is more for my usage..

Have to check more options in camera and have to test the battery by playing games

Hope soon Samsung rollout android 10 update to this go monster

Such an amazing phone with a long battery life. I had an battery life of 15hrs with a lot of heavy usage.the camera quality is great. I love its speed i did not face anny issues. I charged in a decent speed. Its display is one of the best . The one ui is simply the best. The build quality is ok .there is no heating issues.the call quality is great. Even with a single speaker the sound quality is amazing and loud it doesnot have any distortion.the biometrics are fast. Overall an amazing phone with a large battery in this price segment will recommend to buy this phone.

Pros:- Good design.
  Good battery life.
  Sound and display quality is good.
  No issues with signal strength.
  No Overheating.
  Front camera quality is fine.
Cons:-  Rear Camera quality is not upto the mark.
  Night mode camera quality is not good, it's better to
  use normal camera with or without flash, rather than
  using night mode.
In an overview it's a good mobile for performance and battery.
And for the people who are more interested in taking photos, it will not satisfy you people.

Camara, battery backup and other performance is good but when I am mirroring it with my smart tv, it is showing error in exact  20 second that week connection. With my other phone Redmi Note 5 Pro, I smoothly connect my smart tv. Means there is a technical fault in this phone.
2nd thing is when we connect it with charger, in charging mode, there is no indicator after 10 second whether it is charging or not. You have to unlock the phone every time to check it charging status.
Third fingerprint sensor is not connected with camara so u can not use it to take selfie like in other mobiles .

This is an excellent product launched by samsung....it is highlighted in all aspects..
Camera is awesome with various options and effects along with its great 48 megapixel triple rear camera
Touch is awesome...its super amoled dislay makes the feel to the next level
Battery is the key feature
Performance is very satisfying in aspects of gaming multi tasking and much more
Various other interesting features are-smart app pop ups,night mode,always on display,dolby atmos for great sound experience, smart view and much more..
This is the best smartphone i ever used

1. 6000 Mah battery drain out quickly..
poor performance.
2. Earphone slot placed at the bottom which is difficult to carry when you plugging and play.
3. Mobile got heat up while play games and continuous usage.
4. Display also not good if you are watching low quality videos for data saving compare to others.
5. Touch performances are very slow in some cases.
6. Over expectations in camera?
very poor 16MP selfie. Picture comes worst than 5MP.

Sumsung M30s 128gb

M30s doesn't last like it has 6000 mAh battery, it feels like 4000 mAh battery! And it takes around 2&amp;half hours to charge! If you are buying it for 6000 mAh battery just don't. Camera is better in outdoors but indoors it struggles. And lol on those people who laugh on Oppo, Vivo &amp; other Chinese phones, at least they give price to performance, Compared to them M30s is around 10k phone, I am planning to exchange it for realme 5s or 5 Pro or Note 8 pro. And Never plan to buy Samsung again. We are paying only for Samsung name!!

The finger print reader in this device is very very slow than the other devices in that price range
Not only this problem the face unlock is too delay than the finger ptint scanner, those problem are most affect my daily usess. The battery backup is very nice it gave charge upto 3 or more days while  battery saving mode. It comes with super amoled display it so attractive to me nd thr rear camera was so cute but the front camera not interested me overall this phone is best in this price range especially the battery life

Excellent choice for people who are addictive to phone because it is 6000 mAh and it is a monster.
* Camera is good
* Best battery in the market
* Display is marvellous
* Touch is good
* Processor is not as good as opposed and realme

One major and more important thing is it is not Chinese. So I bought this with pride (though it is not Indian but not Chinese)

Cheers

Considering the price and the features offered here, Galaxy M30s is one of the best phones on the market. As a user the most important features for me are the battery and the display. My previous phone was a redmi note 4, it was a good phone but I didn't like the display, the colors were bland. I went for M30s as it comes with a big battery and an AMOLED display. It was perfect for me. I have been using the phone extensively for past 3 weeks now and dont have any complaints  whatsoever.  If you want one go for it!

Things which samsung has intentionally  removed to differentiate  ffrom their higher variant

1) No secure folder feature. You cant individually lock an app
2) No vibrations feedback for keyboard.
3) Cheap build, makes sound on pressing back cover
4) Removed so many One UI feature just because this phone is cheap.

I mean come on. Hardware de diya but sorftware nahi.

Screen and battery is USP of this device , camera is okayish

Expecting One UI features in future updates.

Samsung m30s is all in one. The camera quality is too good to be ignored. It's one of the best best property of M30s. BATTERY is what is said about it the monster battery. One time charged and uh dont have to worry about battery draining for one whole day. The fingerprint reader is also good. It's been 2 months since I bought it,and it still works as if bought yesterday because people generally have an opinion that online products are not upto their expectations or the reliability is low. Samsung m30s is definitely a beautiful product with monster battery, and a high resolution camera with the security features.

Overall a product worth for how much u spent. Best part is the 6000mh battery back up allows u do watevr u want for atleast 20hours nonstop, otherwise it can give u upto 30 hrs backup.
Now the camera quality is poor, its not at all a rear 48megapxl which samsung claims, and better not to tlk about front camera,bettr not to use it😂
Other than that design is good, performance is much bettr,no lagging issues till now, new added features like pop up window multi split screen &amp; much more to have under 15k.
Apart from camera this phone have all the positive reasons to buy.

Worst phone ever.
Good things:-
Good battery back up.
Finger print, face unlocking is faster.
Camera is ok level. It's not good while zooming time.
Its work excellent at the time of new.
Display quality out of the level.

Bad things:-
After two month it get hanging..
While google photos open and opening the  mail attachment.
am facing some network issues.
Every day two times I restart my mobile for getting internet.
It's not price worthy.

I am using mobile since 2005, started with nokia, sony, lenovo, mi.. for the first time i am using Samsung mobile....i love it....professionally i am a doctor....can't afford switch off (m30s u can rely on battery fast charging and huge 6), no network problem (had with mi), you can't beat display, Samsung operating system smooth, no security issue, i don't use camra much but whenever i used its upto my expectations.  In single sentence i recommend Samsung to every professional person.

One of my best buys this year. M 30 S from Samsung boasts a pocketful of features in the budget segment. The main attraction for me was the mammoth sized 6000 MAh battery, but none of the other features are by any means a disappointment. The 48 Megapixel camera is pretty decent, especially the super slow and hyperlapse features perfectly captured the Diwali celebrations.AMOLED display, Dolby Atmos are indeed cherry on top.
The overall vibe of the phone is that of a solid budget segment phone with a smattering of features that tries to capture the essence of the note series.

I like
1. Aesthetics
2. Easy Use
Dislike
1. Facing  difficulty because  1 to 0 number is in one row. Provision  may be  given that it must be in other columns  like  in previous  Linova K10 Model.
2. Camera is 48 Megapixel but when  we compare Red Me Model  with same Megapixel,  camera  quality is inferior. It must be improved.
3. For increasing customer  deligtness,  a free phone cover  may be provided. You may include  the  cost but when  company  say it is free with  phone, customer  gets attracted and there by  increasing  of sales in this cut throat  competition.

This is one of the terrific phone from samsung. Gigantic battery life as 6000 mah  is a huge battery and it works for my father for almost 5-6 days with frequent calls in a day. Camera quality is awesome, even night images are of very good quality. Rest all the functions are as usaul. One of the differentiator is the speed of the phone. Major games are working without any lag.
All in all its a wonderful creation from samsung in this price range. Very happy to use it.

Samsung has fooled the customers ...camera quality is worse , it's very worse as compared to the basic mobile .... even battery needs to charge after 6 hours... what it was claim to be of 48 megapixels and 6000 may battery is all false commitments... can samsung replace this mobile ...I had spend 17k for a poor quality mobile

Made in India. Excellent value for money. Fast, good-looking, lovely display, superb photos, started using it 3 days ago and only today has it reached recharge level - that's a mammoth battery.
Seems silly now to have bought more expensive phones in the recent past when this M30s delivers all I need at an economical price. Recommended.

This is big thumbs up for people who r on the move. Screen is huge and nice to work on infinity display. Pics from triple camera are an eye candy. Experience using the phone has been very smooth till now, used it for a week. Attached a unboxing video. The only thing missing is the metal body. But the polycarbonate also gives a good feel. I think worth much more than the price, specially since I got in a good deal on amazon :)

Samsung phones are very good.After buying Samsung's phone, it seems that it was a great deal.The best thing about Samsung was that I like its display which is very very and very good.#value for money. #super amoled.
The best thing for Samsung Care is its radiation level is very low which is good for our health.
But there is a big problem in my phone which is about battery backup.
I do not know whether it is software problem or hardware.
The M30s is a good phone, but if it has the option of a secure folder, then it is even more fun.
good job Samsung
thank you

Very good. I have found a little problem with my mobile sim tray. I am using two sims in sim tray. Sometimes, both the net works are missing and shows there is no sim. I pushed sim tray with thumb. Then, signal came. May be there is tray. It happend two three occasions. But my Airtel sim not working.Getting very low signal and some times losing signal and talk becomes one way. I have to find out actual reason for this. I will have to write to Samsung also.

1) Battery life is good but not excellent. For me with moderate use it stays up to 24hrs.
2) Camera quality is much better and especially low light photography is much better than my old MI-A1
3) Processor speed is not impressive. Response time is not good, my old MI-A1 was way more faster.

Overall it is a good buy, unless you are planning for gaming.

Internet speed is not good, same network for same place in two different phones(m30 and redmi note 5 pro) the later one performance is outstanding upto 4 mbps but this phone hardly goes beyond 200 kbps. Camera will make you happy though and battery life goes well(not useing more due to bad download speed) fingerprint takes upto 3 memorable  captures though the redmi got 5. Display is good enough. You should try realme or redmi's recent note 8 pro. This phone is also not that user friendly though it does the work, only 2 things to praise is battery and camera.

I really disappoint this phone

Purchased this phone for battery feature but it drains fast.. doesn't look like 6000mah. Camera performance is ok. Always on feature was surprise. Adaptive Brightness is malfunctioning. Sometimes when you pick up the phone from pocket you find that the brightness is very low that even can't see anything. I expected from Samsung device that it would have work nearby the features promoted on paper but it is way more far in reality. In this competitive market it is important to maintain your brand value.

Every time Samsung launches a new device it Amazes me with it's price and feature. But this one really surprised me. A way too much faster comparing mid range phones and gaming experience is really cool with its game booster . You gonna love its camera with ultrawide and depth sensor . Super slomo is good but i am missing night mode. And the battery life really #monster. Its takes around one and half hour to fully charge with its 15w fast charger and you can seamlessly go with it all day long once you fully charged.

The phone is an allrounder. You can game on it . You CAN Shoot slowmo . Click great pictures. Watch movies on the super amoled display with ease with the monster 6000mah battery for the whole day. Fun fact - You can play PUBG on HDR ULTRA ON THIS PHONE for atleast 5 hours with a bit of heating which is fine But to give all this samsung compromised a bit with the build quality but thats not a problem since its still pretty good . Overall its a great phone in this price segment. GREAT JOB SAMSUNG !

Just loving it.
I bought 6GB and 128gb variant
Has a nice screen display which gives a good feel when using.
Battery is really awesome..it doesn't drain at all..hats off to Samsung for this incredible battery.
Just little disappointment with front Camera.
Over all it's a tough competitor to many phones.
All this features at 17k .that too from Samsung brand is what inspiring to buy.
Best thing is, my colleagues after looking at my phone..they were so impressed with the features and I booked two other phones for my colleagues from my Amazon .

THIS IS BETTER FOR THEM WHO WANT TO HAVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE OF CAMERA AND BATTERY IN NORMAL COST OF SMARTPHONE ..
IT WILL BE A BEATABLE CELL PHONE TO OTHERS IN SAME COST ..
The fingerprint reader works with a good way
And the back camera also give you satisfaction but the front camera is cheap in work .....
Battery is working 2 days in normal mode ...
You can watch 5 to 6 movies continue with internet ....
The cell phone has thick body  that makes it some unbearable ...

Recieved in 2days.. thanks to amazon
Sound quality is fine
Battery life is decent,  can last for 24hrs in medium power saving mode after hours of gaming,youtubing etc.
Display is AWESOME!!
Build quality seems low
Camera feels like pixelerated while shooting indoors
Outdoor videography in broad day light is tremendous and the stabilization of video make feels like using a camcorder
Photo quality is good enough until you zoom in too much
Gaming runs without glitch thanks to the 9611 processor
Expecting much more in updates
Overall nice product in this price range

With it's 6000 mah battery m30s is an awesome purchase, in hand experience is really good and feels lightweight compared to the massive battery it has.
Camera quality is really good and looks natural, ultra wide is love 😍
Gaming experience on M30s is amazing and smooth, we can play heavy games easily without any lag. Game Booster is very helpful while gaming as we can block all the notifications and popups.
M30s comes with every feature a person needs on his device(big battery, good performance, great camera, awesome design) with such attractive price.

Awesome product at this price...
Things I loved:
1. Battery stupendous.. being a heavy user still give me 24 hours backup.
2.Finger print and face detection unlock works like charm.
3. Ample storage.. works smooth
4.Camera good specs. Not tried it yet.. not a picture person
5. After sales service better then Chinese makes.. Manufactured in India it says.. thumbs up

Downside- takes time to get charged,
Not waterproof,  but with this price range I can make my peace with it...

The screen cracked somehow and I did not even drop it once, does not seem to have gorilla glass. Luckily bought the insurance alongside mobile purchase.

Camera is not good for 48 Mpx!!
Battery back is just ok for 6000 MAmp!
Too fragile, plastic build very flimsy.
 Processing speed is very average,

Not worth the price! Too overrated.  Not happy with the purchase, should have gone with Motorola

The mobile has been amazing every since I received it on Monday. I have charged only twice since Monday and its battery does justify its Monster tag even though I have been using it for resource consuming apps such as Fifa, Pokemon and others.

The camera is impressive and captures many details. Enjoying the slow motion and super slow motion, these are very cinematic.

It's well built, not heavy to carry and with cool gradient colors, this device does grab the eye balls.

I recommend this mobile, it is a true seal for this price and Samsung has hit the right spot.

I have been waiting for a midrange phone like this and I grabbed it when it was released for sale. I just loved this switch from my previous Motorola phone to Samsung Galaxy M30s. This phone is simply superb for its price. I liked its overall performance, great picture quality, beautiful selfie pics, the user friendliness of the interface and of course the sensitivity of its fingerprint sensor. All in all a very satisfied user of the M30s!

Didn't expect such an excellent product from Samsung, kuddos! Anyways they didn't provide a proprietary 15v charger, no back protective case, and, a scratch guard ain't gonna put a hole in company's bank account

About m30s
1. absolutely stunning samoled display
2. mega battery only if you're being provided with a 15v charger which seller doesn't
3. Okayish performance, nanosecond lag on software on daily basis use sometime
4. Alright it's a great phone under 15k, so smile a little and have fun y'all

This is the best phone available in this price segment. I always liked the "M" series smartphones from samsung but always kinda avoided them because of the under powered processors and well, this phone takes care of it.
Pros:
Quite affordable
Crazy battery life
Samsung Amoled panel
One of the best performing processors you can get in this price range

Cons:
Average camera quality(This is more towards software optimisation and the same can be solved with future software updates)
Does not feel as premium in hand because of it's plastic back

Great  package as a whole, just head phones missing.
1) Battery lasts for 2-3 days with normal use with all time mobile data on.
2) Best call quality.
3) UHD recording very good even in low light.
4) Face unlock very fast.
5) Slow motion and ultra slow motion need good light conditions, start blinking in night shooting, that's a issue I observed till now.
6) Photo quality is not as expected from 48MP camera, even not comparable to other 48 MP camera phones.

Phone is quite good with a good battery life and many features out of which many I'm yet to figure out. Build quality is definitely not best and it could have been better than what it currently is. Camera is good that supports slow motion shooting and other modes but the night mode is definitely something that needs to be worked upon. It only supports 2500 iso max as far as I know where as a year old phones like Nokia support around 9000 iso.

Have recommended  &amp; got to purchase for other two of my friend.....a full charge is giving almost 30 hrs back up with usage of bluetooth/wifi/medium brightness/few hrs of gaming/video theme on/5 hrs of video playback n so on.....one year screen replacement makes it secure and  +Samsung after sales service is more reliable than anyone else in android category of phone.

Nice ergonomics Samsung Team.
Thanks,

The only reason why i bought this was for Camera &amp; Battery. Both are pathetic, worst than a mediocre mobile. While it says 'fast charging', it takes ages to charge &amp; im forced to carry my charger along everyday to office coz it charges slow &amp; reaches just 30-40% in 2 hours. The picture quality is that of a 15 MP camera. Moment i zoom the picture after clicking, it becomes grainy which is not the case with a good camera. I choose to ignore the heating issues. Even after i got my phone exchanged, both camera &amp; battery failed to impress me. A big NO to low graded Samsung phone again.

Samsung galaxy m30s... It just changed my lookaway for the samsung smart phones... Before this i was having oppo reno... Which i would say was the most worst phone i had ever had... But with this phone... First i dont have to worry to charge it again and again... It gives a great battery life... Second is the camera... Wow its really awesome... I mean... '480mp' awesome... After i got this phone and used it... I really got it for my family members too... Right now i have 3 samsung galaxy m30s mobile at my home... I would really prefer this phone for everyone...

Front camera is good I am satisfied.
Back camera 48 mega pixels is really creating and fooling  people...
Bought it for camera, 48+8+5 is just on paper, picture quality is just 8MP, even a 2500 phone clicks better than this...front camera is super

Back camera  is 48 megapixel but Hardware it only in the Hardware range not software level...
Samsung should improve back camera as per 48 megapixel in software level

Other than all ok

If you calculate the 9V with 1.67A as shown on the adapter, the result is 15W. Simple Google search. Do not get misled by other reviews.
So far, there are no complaints regarding the phone.
Battery backup is great. Haven't charged since I got it yesterday morning and it came with 57% charge and I've been using mobile data and it is at 21% as of now.
I know the camera is not good enough but I still bought it because it's not a concern for me.
The only complaint is that the charger/USB cable is short and looks like a cheap cable.
Still, a great phone for what I've paid.

This phone have many good features.
Battery backup  is good easily cover 1 day and half.
Charging to 100% its take 2:30 hours
Monster battery but no so weight
Camera is supper but when u zoom its become pixelated.
Super slow motion is only for 8 sec but you can take long video at slow motion mode.
Background blur is average but good..
Fingerprint reader  working good.
Overall this phone is best in this price.
And samsung is also a trusted brand .
I love samsung..

Nice product. the phone is not bulky even it contain 600 mah massive battery. this is the main plus point in this price point. the second advantage is the processor. Samsung has used the most advanced processor i this price range which can handle multiple complex situations except heavy games.

Battery backup is amazing in a full charge i can use the phone the entire day without even touching the charger again..
Camera is Good but not good as compared to Samsung A50S cause the video stabilization is better in A50S and it also supports Bixby. Low light photos and videos are also not that sharp . Phone don't heat much while playing heavy games like pubg and cod . Sometimes the finger prints doesn't react but the face recognition works fine.. the screen ratio and the colours are crisp..

I love samsung ph. I was really exciting to have it. I wanted to pre order it. But there is no option. So i brought it on the day of launch. Samsung never fewls me down with this ph. It really has the monster battery. But slightly slow in charge. But i love the features and camera. Fingure rint is amazing. Camera makes me proffesional photographer

Ok I really didn't expect this from this phone to be honest. I wanted a phone with an SAMOLED screen for a long time. So when a phone that came as a package of great battery backup and awesome camera quality arrived I waited no more. I usually game for hours so having a 6000mah battery really helps. And also Dolby Atmos adds a new realm to sound quality given that you have good headphones. And for gaming I felt no lag on games like PUBG and Mobile Legends though some micro stutters on Asphalt and Call of Duty Mobile. Other than that it's a gem. The new Exynos processor is awesome.

Giving a review after using the mobile for a week. Battery backup and sound quality is excellent. This phone has 48 MP, but, pic quality is as good as 5 MP camera phone which is worst part. The body is made of polycarbonate which prone to damage mobile even if it falls down from 2-3 feet. Samsung should have provided headphone, if they don't provide case and scratch guard.
When I requested Amazon to replace mobile, they have just been passing time without giving any proper reason.

It is an amazing phone to be honest. Battery battery battery!!!!! By profession I'm an architect, sometimes i need to be on site for hours and hours. M30s battery saves me all the time. I use the the mobile all day and yet I have plenty charge left in the evening.
But the camera is not that great. It is not worth 48MP.
But still I recommend this product considering all other specs.

All my friends say that samsung will be great at the beginning but gets dull in performance after one year. So I can't give my opinion on it yet for this phone. But surely it is a monster.

Reviewing it after 10 days usage.

Let me honestly confess that I fell for outstandingly great battery life, 6+128 GB combination,  good camera, finger print reader, bundled GPU and overall reliability of Samsung.

Having bought through Amazon sale, availed discounts from SBI card and returned old phone, I  feel happy that I have made right decision.

Thanks Samsung for launching such an fabulous product and thanks Amazon for providing us the marketplace and convenience to buy....

In comparison to other phones in this price range ....battery and camera are highlighted....battery is good, long lasting and gets5/5....but camera being 48mp it's not at all to the mark 1/5,very dissapointed . There is no difference between a 16mp Cam and this one...... U can buy this phone only for long battery, rest of features are same in comparison ....

Battery is the key that's why I have  choosen this phone.as the name says battery is such monster like I am using a 100% charged phone and it not even half drain till 10 pm. Camera quality is superb as compare to price offered and super amoled screen makes the touch and user experience very much super. 15300 yes 15300 .Aur kya chahiye. I was using note 8 previously .Shifting from flagship phone to this is not a bad choice.fingerprint works similar as that of other flagship segment. Such a nice choice to have 6+128 because 6gb ram gives faster response and phone doesn't hangs up

As it's on Amazon sale. I got this with awesome price range.
4 days after use :
Hulk size battery = 2 days without charging with full use.
Speed and performance  is awesome.
Multiple camera mode with 42 megapixels. Photo qualities are best.
This is my 1st Samsung  product and it's best. Worth of price.
Go for it

The fingerprint readee is quite fast for the phones budget. Camera quality is also decent when compared with other phones in this budget and no doubt about it the battery life on the device allows for a full 24 hr usage when full charge.
However, the phone is quite slow when compared to other phones, the proccessor is incapable of running multiple tasks and it takes a while to change windows. It starts lagging the minute you connect it to any other device like your car or you smartwatch. A better processor would have made it a better phone for the budget.

Camera quality is ok. No heating issues observed,

Fingerprint reader is amazing. We can add 4 finger prints. Camera quality and clarity also super. It was 48 MP . Both front and rear camera clarity good.Battery life also amazing. Once we fully charged it , we can use and videos and you tube without fear for  a whole day . Totally a best product at a very  best low cost phone. I am suggesting this phone to all my relatives.

It's an awesome phone, this is second M30 in my home, first one 8 months ago M30 and now M30S, great improvements from M30 to M30S. This phone beats all the iPhones we have at home including the iPhone 11. Trust me I have been using iPhone for over 10 years, I still use, but the M30 is no different from iPhone in all aspects, in certain aspects M30 is better than iPhone 11

I have used this mob from 3 days ,battery life is awesome and I also play Cod mob 3 hrs continues  ,i played at high graphics and it's just amazing, there is very low heating after playing 3hrs i thank amazon for delivery in 1 day.
Display is slightly curved and colors are amazing.
Some about camera both the camera's are awesome,  night shot got some extra light otherwise it is also good.
There is nothing to about battery life..

After couple months of usage, still an amazing performance. Great stats for the price as compared to other brands. Fingerprint sensor satisfactorily responsive, camera quality is great for daylight pictures. The greatest thing for me is however the battery life. Without power saving and sync on, the charge lasted throughout the day even with more than 4-5 hours of usage.
Small heating issue due to background apps but that can be resolved by limiting the number of apps that can run in backend.

It’s a nice phone and a nice phone only. Even though it has a 3 camera setup with a 48MP lens it doesn’t have the software to support it . The image processing is terrible . A lot of noise in the image even when taken in best lit environment. The caller app seems to have a bug which freezes from time to time after ending a call. The battery backup is great of course . Thanks to the behemoth of a battery. The screen is amazing.

Fingerprint reader is working good, it doesn't work if your finger is wet or dirty. Which is a good thing.
Camera performance is average. Front camera is not that good as compared to other samsung devices. We expect more as we all know samsung mobile can provide better than this, as some people do purchase samsung phone for their good camera quality. Night mode gives you a image full of grains which can't be considered as a good one.
Battery life is superb. As it last for a day undoubtedly with 3-4 hours of gaming, watching movies, browsing etc.

The screen is not as it should be, Its accidentally dropped withing 1 feet hight and screen shattered like its drop from 10th floor. Too bad quality of screen. It should be hard.

Camera quality is not as its need to be 48mp camera, click same quality as Samsung 16mp camera. So not good camera at All.
For Slomo...its just 720 frame so grain will come on videos in any lights.
Super Slomo, it will shoot only 5-10 second shot and you never know what action you have shot....so bad time quality.

over all not bad for just regular use..nothing special in it

I liked almost everything about the phone. The only problem I had with the phone was its camera. The pro mode of the camera isn't what I expected. The ISO reduction doesn't work properly. I tried to take a pic of a light bulb, focusing on the filament, but it didn't work as I expected. Also no option to set the aperture or shutter speed. It would have been cool if these functions were also included. I am still experimenting with the phone overall. Will update review after 6 months.

Super standby phone for longer battery standby, excellent triple camera for capturing images in HDR mode, wide angle, splendid performance, and exciting features by samsung, it's a pure samsung-google collaborated OS, awesome performance by samsung exynos processor, 15W fast charge with type C charger, Super Amoled display, totally mesmerizing phone with great features at this budget.
Body was made of plastic, not that much graphical design, night mode was little upset, except these everything was superb.

LIKE
Ultra smooth and super display
Yet to test the camera fully but so far so good
DISLIKE
Messaging app. Could not even mark a message as spam or block it. Had to install a third party app.
Always on display seems a gimmick. No true value.
Notification methods could be improved.

This mobile has some heating issues,  when you use youtube or facebook within 15 minutes its temperature increases very much than normal. It is not expected from a phone of such price range. Another problem i am facing is that mobile hotspot aumatically turns off after sometime (within 1 hour of turning it on).

Reviewing after 3 days of use.
PROS: 1. Camera is awesome. Both the front and the rear cameras give great images. Decent enough in low light too.
2. Battery life is great. Lasts entire day easily with some gaming too.
3. Fingerprint reader is fast enough.
4. Display is amazing. It's a delight to the eyes.
5. Phone is lightweight and the Opal Black colour gives it a really premium look.

Cons:
Nothing as such to mention yet.

The fingerprint reader is s bit slow, battery life is superb, but charging is not that fast .
Perfrmomanc is ok, not as per the hardware given, it doesn't feel like 6gb .
The best part is the display and works like a charm in outdoor conditions under the sun. Auto brightness works well certainly improved from previous generation Samsung phones in the same price range.
Outer build is average.
Overall its a good phone as per price you won't be disappointed nither it will wow you at any front.

After 5 months I am giving this review mobile is worst, horrible experience suddenly the mobile is struck down, the display showing only Samsung until battery down, I tried to switch off but mobile not switched off, when the battery is getting down auto switched off. After switch off I switch on the mobile then it the display is showing only Samsung, I tried so many times it has not working. In the present lock down situation the mobile servicing shops also not working.

The camera quality is not good. I would say it is Average. I compared with Redmi Note 8 and the latter was twice better. Also it takes ab awful 5 seconds to save the pic when captured with 48MP.
If you use the mobile phone without back cover, the back panel will catch scratches within a day or two.
I would not recommend this phone.

Pros

Good camera at this price range. Tried many options and most  of it are reasonably  good

Display is top notch. More than worth the price

Cons
Battery is ok. Not to the extent  of they promote. Comes for 20 hours for me with good use of calls and net. Don't  play games though
Feels slightly  heavy.
Graphic user interface  is not as good as xioami. Needs a lot of improvement

One can go for it. In any case, none of the android  devices last longer  than 2- 3 years

Sharing this feedback after 15 days of usage.
Camera quality is good( not excellent) , fingure print sensor you have to struggle a bit by moving your fingure.
Most importantly battery part, its ofcourse not meeting expectations of 6000 MAH battery . I can't believe that this monster battery is not able to survive more than one day with very minimal usage of phone..I used few phone having 4000 mah and they survived for 2 days.

First of let me tell you i am very old user of samsung products i had bought A series  few months back .. and now this is my first M series.. Before buying everything we should think about 1000 time whether this will good or not.. but after buying this.. i fall in love with the all new  m series weather it's sAmoled infinity screen or its battery  life.. this is the first time i haven't regretted to purchase this phone.. camera quality can be do much better but it's ok in this price this is the best one i can purchase.. anyone who is thinking to buy  don't think just go and purchase..

Awesome phone with fast fingerprint reader and camera quality is also good. Very impressed by the battery life. No matter what I do with the phone whole day still 50% charge is there at the end of the day. I literally watched video whole day still had above 40% charge is impressive, and the price range is also perfect because I personally feel that spending on phone more than this is useless. This phone definitely prove that point now. Plus side its Samsung very old and reliable company. Just hoping that I will get the good after sale service also.

I don't think this phone atleast provides u the scope to complain about anything...if u have purchased it for rs 11600...it's simply awesome...And regarding the camera...it's not bad at all...it may seem to fall little behind...just a little....only when compared with the sony IMX586...which becomes a mere con compared to the no. of pros like battery,display and UI...Overall I can say that it's the best phone I can get in this budget segment...Good work samsung...

The battery is a beast. Good front &amp; back camera. Processor also fine. Plastic back cover is a big turn off. Looks smart &amp; not heavyweight. Affordable with all basic features at a pocket friendly price range. Additional 1K cashback recieved from Amazon even before the headset arrived which is definitely impressive. Good exchange value for my old phone &amp; if required easy no cost EMI options also available on most of your credit cards which is definitely helpful. Overall good experience &amp; most importantly it's a branded product.

It's after 2 months I m writing this review
Actual review can be said now major USP of this product was its Monster Battery And it stand well with it I get Battery Backup hoto 2 days
Fingerprint Reader is good enough But sometimes twice pr thrice the finger should be adjusted to get recognized
Camera quality is good enough the only thing I didn't liked was when the picture is captured at 48MP it take few sec to get saved thats the only thing
Overall it's A Good Product to Buy

Pros : Everybody knows about the m30s who are actively searching for the new phone

Cons : after using this phone,

1. Upper 25% body heats up - u cannot able to talk for more than 15 mins directly thru phone or calling speaker...

2. Slightly Calling Speaker echo problem due
To gap b/w the back and the body.

This issue has not reported in any of the vedio as major concerns are on performance  and camera quality.

Cons of Amazon : once u buy there is no option to replace and return directly as we used to have before in Amazon app.

Fingerprint sensor on back is super fast and accurate as well as.
Samsung Galaxy M30s will house a powerful triple rear camera system with 48-megapixel primary sensor,
 The Galaxy M30s is its mammoth 6,000mAh battery that aims to deliver a two-day battery life. The M30s is the only phone in India right now to offer this large a battery.
Display and processor performance is feel very very better

Good battery backup with best in class sAMOLED display with proper visibility under direct sun light. Easy to handle with good camera and samsung UI.

Worth buying for people who consider smartphone with good battery backup, camera and display. Not for intensive gamers.

Moderate usage gave me average 48 hours battery backup. Like the dual sim 4G with seperate micro SD card support.

This is the phone I was looking for. From a long long time. My office 68 km from my home, that's why I travel every day by train approximately 4 to 6 hour. That's why I was looking  for a phone  with long battery life and Samsung fulfilled my all need by launching  this beautiful  phone Samsung  M30 S. Not only battery but also the feature of phone are out standing like camera,build quality. Display everything is just perfect. I ordered black which is looking stunning with blue shed. I have received my phone delivery in just 2 day without any shipping charges thanks Amazon  and Samsung.

Fingerprint sensor not amazing.
16 more front camera - not good, softens your face, edges are not sharp. Face looks girly.
Back camera- nothing great. As usual. Takes 2.5 to 3 hours to charge fully. 6000maH battery takes so much time to get charged. You have be without phone for this amount of time and Who will b without phone for this much time?? Body of the phone is poly carbonate and the shape is also not good. color doesn't look good. Looks are like old generation.
Pros:
s Amoled display
Buy xiomi redmi phones..they are better than this phone.

This phone was purchased for my father. So the primary requirement was battery life and stable software with minimum glitches.
The phone has not disappointed so far.
Fingerprint reader is not the fastest but does the job.
Camera is fast. Again Redmi Note 8 pro ia better.
Battery Life is the best. Superb back-up. 2.5 days with moderate usage.
Screen Quality is damn good. Samsung's S-AMOLED is always so crisp.
Basic functions are served. I am happy with the purchase.

It's a good phone with good battery
life
However the front camera has left lot to be desired  when compared with Real me XT or even MI A3 in the mid budget segment.
Interface is not so helpful too.
Icons in display and overall feel in the hand with plastic back cover doesn't  provide premium or decent look.
Much better option to go now will be Redmi Note 8 pro

This is a Mobile which is valuable for a consumer who's having standard budget.
There is no mobile to replace it with this because of its 6000 mAH battery life and the camera clarity.
The variable of 128 GB is damn super.
The main thing about the camera is the clarity and the Super slow motion feature added to the Mobile.
There is no other phone which is providing this much features and brand quality at this affordable budget range. The screen of Amoled is very sexy and gives the best picture experience.

Screen and battery backup are awesome performance is too good no lagging speaker works well ,look varies from person to person but but but charging gave me headache
... about camera 16 mp my foot its about 8to 12 mp and what can i say about 48 mp camera .... samsung please dont ,this is too much ... you will lose your all time customers .. please provide 25mp and be genuine about it . If you are looking for battery backup this is great but there comes charging i dont know what they are talking about 15W ,do i have to purchase it exclusively i dont know and for camera think twice.

In short :- THE BEST PHONE IN 15K CATEGORY.
Samsung is killing the other brands by releasing this beast. I got this device for 12k(6g 128 variant).
The camera is good compare to other competitors but little bit is improvement is required which they will do by providing software update. The steady video mode is a class apart. Gaming is the best no lags in pubg in high settings and pinch of frame drops in her mode and COD works really well.
The 6000mah battery lasts 1.5 days for me . Overall this phone is a beast and would really recommend this over other competitors

In this heavy competition world, especially in mobiles..  Samsung has proved once again it is the best among competitors. I was flabbergasted!!! Looking at the phone display and the smoothness of touch screen. I loved the way Samsung designed the phone with a monster battery !! And anyone can hold it without pain cause it doesn't weigh too much...!!! In case of camera, I got the best pictures with keen details. But performance is not upto the mark, it stucks and bit slow in response.
Overall.. ok phone

The main plus is display it's awesome other than that the battery is draining moderately gaming is fine no heating issues till now MY overall rating 3.8/5
Battery:3.9/5
Display:5/5
Speed:3.7/5
One UI: LOL (I PURCHASED A 6 GB RAM VARIANT IT OPERATES LIKE 3 OR 4 GB VARIANT  ONE UI SUCKS AS ALWAYS NO IMPROVEMENT NO WHERE NEAR OXYGEN OS)
CAMERA:3.4/5(REAR CAMERA) 2.5/5(FRONT CAMERA)
HAVE TO SEE HOW MANY DAYS I HAVE TO SURVIVE WITH THIS DEVICE

The phone already hangs like a two year old mobile. Not sure if it will work even for a year. Processing speed is worst and makes me feel that RAM could be 1 GB. Bad buy . Would not recommend this phone to anyone.

Samsung m30s is a very good phone. It has super amoled display and 6000 mah battery which is very wonderful.It has many new features. But camera section is somewhat weak as compare to other chinese phones. Camera also has many features which other companies not provide in this price range. Camera captures good images but when you zoom in the picture. It lacks details and sharpness as compared to other phones in this price range. And also in low light condition camera suffers. If Samsung provides update for camera then this phone will be the best phone in this price range

Good things in M30S:
1. Good display
2.Battery backup upto 1.5 days atmost
3. Face recognition very fast
4.Camera good one(not the best, but slow and super
slow motion is very best)
5.Fast Charging atmost 2.15hrs (from 0 to 100)

Disappointment in M30S:

1.No Knox security, Securefolder And Samsung Mall
(Which are unique Samsung apps)
2.NFC not available and also no Samsung Pay
3.No SBike mode
4.Plastic back case is little disappointing
5.No backcase with the box

Pathetic camera.
Pictures snapped appear distorted and grainy likewise a picture looses pixles when zoomed in.
Forget a megapixel camera, It feels like the pics are snapped from a VGA camera phone  as nokia 6610.

Best mobile in 10k to15k.

The performance of this mobile is terrific, PUBG graphics supports HDR  with no lags.
The battery life is good , it comes for 3 days backup with 2g standby and 2 days for 4g standby.
Camera is excellent in daylight and also in night with night mode.
Best mid range Smartphone with Super Amoled Display and it is so crystal clear with vivid mode. U can test display clarity with 4k or 8k videos in youtube.
Little heavy because of 6000mah battery.
Best competitive to Note 8 pro , Realme 5 pro and Vivo Z1 pro.

It's been 1 month using this phone so here I am with the best review u have ever read.
I am a YouTuber so I am decisive when it comes to gadgets.. so here is my review ..
Camera quality :- I rate it as 4 star it is good in a daylight but when it comes to take a picture in dark light its not upto the mark .
Battery life :- it's quite good u can use for 1 day after charge it once
Looks :- 4 star ... U will receive a very good look under this price
So at last u can go for it good quality phone in the reasonable price
Good deal under this price.

This phone is the best i could get in this price range. If you get a Samsung phone in this price, why would you go for a chinese brand. Buy this phone without thinking twice. Best battery life compared to any phone in market, best display to watch movies in hd, camera is also good and performance wise also very good with no lags. This phone will redefine that brand matters more due to quality it provides than just specifications which are offered by chinese phones. The fact of the matter is you get all good features in this phone at the same price with Samsung brand.

Product is not getting charged by the charger provided. Charging point of the handset is loose and defective. Tried to replace the item but not succeeded. Amazon helpdesk said that they would physically verify the set by their technician and then they decide the next course of action. Got the delivery after 10 days and thereafter so much pain. Being a prime member, get frustrated much.

Monster battery as advertised. Battery life is so good that i can easily get through a full day with one full charge. I am using wifi all the time, watching movies, listening songs using camera once a while and some audio calling too. Still the battery will run easily for a day and the surprise is it will not die completely even after full day of usage. Ram management is also good. Fingerprint sensor is not so fast or great  as expected but still good though. Camera is also wonderful even in the night with low light. Overall this is a terrific purchase.

The phone looks premium, display and battery is one thing that beats other mobile like a pro. I have Samsung s8. I bought this mobile for playing call of duty and pubg and both runs super smooth on d mobile. With the monster battery I don't have to keep it plugged in while playing

Its been 4 months that i have bought this phone however i regret now buying it. I also did a 2nd mistake of ordering the same for my cousin as well. Seems to be a good product and must say battery backup is good too.. But its been several times that the phone camera is not opening need to switch it off and then try and same goes on more than twice only after it opens. Phone shuts down automatically while in use happened this several time again. Wonder if only m facing this or what els dont kno. Would not recommend others buying and facing the same problem as i am facing.

Used the phone for a couple of days.

Pros
*Battery life-Has massive 6000mah battery with amoled screen. So it is really good in terms of battery optimization
*Good ram management
*Less bloatwares but can be uninstalled.
*Excellent display
*Played PUBG for 1hr,no lag no hiccups.
*Camera is really good under sufficient light condition only.

*I wanted a metallic body but the body of M30S is good.

Go for it before offers and stocks run out.

I like battery most as it give me 2 days of battery backup with heavy usage with fast charging it took only 2 hour to charge this monster....no heat up problem till today while playing games or charging the phone or watching web series etc..instead of having 6000mah monster battery this phone is very light comparative to other phones...camera quality is superb and among all I like most super slow and slow motion mode of video recording....overall many other features like smart view,always on display Dolby atmos loved the most....I would like to rate this phone 5 star.

Normally what i look in a phone is fast processor, good camera and long lasting battery. Samsung has delivered all these things in this phone at a great price plus you also get some 10% cashback on select cards.

I am using this phone since one month now and am very happy with picture quality it delivers and the battery backup it provides. The battery easily lasts for 2 full days with reasonable use and will last for one to one and half days with extensive use.

No issues faced till now. Great product by Samsung at very good price.

The mobile is not as claimed in a much hifi way. Without any gaming app ., the battery drains much faster which is not expected from 6000mah battery. I was earlier using honor 8x and the current speed of this much is almost or less than honor8x which is a 4gb ram. Only an average phone only. Delivery from Amazon is also lethargic - ordered on 28th September but delivery was done on 3rd October and that too after a unpleasant and fierce persuasion. In total a bit of disappointment only

Back to Samsung after every long time. But still it's lagging in user friendly customizations.

 I expected minimum 40hr battery back up With 6000mAh, but its not. hardly I'm getting 30hr backup.
Camera also ok ok.. not a great
Don't thing good processor doesn't change! Again its Samsung. "Started hanging " in 50days

Only thing is display! Happy only for it

Mobile is Superb.  Battery life is there for 4 days.  Camera quality is also fine.  Finger print reader, face detection option is nice.  Really using a Superb phone after a long time.  After a long time i have come back to Samsung family.  Before I was a user of Samsung Galaxy S3.  After that I was using phones of different companies.  Now back to Samsung.  Really Love it.

Fingerprint rarely creates an issue.....but works good and effiecient. Camera is the best feature of this phone. 48 MP sensor works real good.....depth sensor sometimes acts wierd but otherwise its good. Scene optimizer increases the saturation level to the best possible texture.With the huge monsterous battery we can use the phone for 2 days with mild usage.With Exynos 9611 as the processor graphic quality in high end games like PUBG and Asphalt 9 works really well. I would suggest it as one of the best phones if u have a budget of nearly Rs.15000

Awesome smartphone!!!! Samsung has launched this monster which is a beast in everything. sAMOLED Display looks just great, Monster Battery life which easily lasts 1 and half day. The performance is terrific and huge games are smooth like butter. In this price range, 48 MP Triple Camera setup gives the best of the photos which even competes with high end devices. Ultra wide is truly wide in true sense. Selfies are good and smooth. Samsung has worked a lot in this one and the price is just the 6th star. Best thing I have bought in recent years.

The first thing I liked about this phone is it's stunning SuperAmoled display which is very sharp and clear. Next thing I like is it's battery life which easily lasts for one and half day for my usage. Samsung's OneUI is lag free and has very cool features. The rear camera is doing well in outdoor and in good lighting conditions but gives a little noisy pictures at night. The front camera does a really quite good job. Smart unlock feature is really handy  and fingerprint is very responsive. The cost of the mobile is reasonable.Samsung mobile at 14k I think it's worth it.

All the feature available for a user with the best pricetag, and Samsung brand.

Honestly telling battery and display 1080p is really good, but the camera is really average, 48 mp is just a word it's as 12 mp only, and many people tell it heats up during charging and games but my phone never got hot at all truly telling there is no heating issue guys, face unlock is fast even during complete dark but finger print is not up to mark, takes longer than MI phone, The software is really good with many features than MI, over all for normal use it's good battery stays for two days average usage.

Good phone with few defects. Proxy sensor doesn't work properly. During the calls when you try to check for msgs and keep the phone down the screen still remains black instead up showing the details on screen. Also immediately  after the call when u need to end the call, the functionality is too slow and takes time to end calls. Also On the key pad few alphabets doesn't work properly

It will be good if Samsung can come up with update for this and resolve this issue

This is really an awesome product at good price.One who really want to luv nature the same way as it is without any filter then this is the best phone with good camera.And the AR emoji is one of the best feature which u will luv it a lot.To handle it is very weightless.it also sense our fingerprint without any trouble.And the top feature of this mobile is 6000mah battery,we can say this as a major plus for the user....Over all I can say it as a Samsung M30s is like a showstopper of 2019🤟🏻

I have been using the phone for the past one week now. It's been a great experience overall. The 6000 mh battery has sorted all the worry of needing a charger in all day. The battery easily lasts a day, even on extensive usage. On normal use it should last two. The Samsung UI is a good experience too, I got adjust very easily for the previous Pure Google experience that I had. The phone does comes with some apps preinstalled that can be uninstall as pwr uers needs.
The camera has a long list of features and is up to the mark. The fingerprint reader is really snappy.

This is my first samsung brand phone. I struggled  initially  but samsung remote access service  is really good. I called them gave access  and they resolved my questions  very fast. Good thing is battery.  I find speaker volume low but when u use headphone  sound is very clear.
Overall  value for money.

I dont think there is a need for a detailed review..as of now...because there are plenty...
After using it for a month..i jst feel tht samsung had made its brand name back to markets.
The battery and amoled display side is the best factor
A bit slow on finger print reader....
Processor is not that slow or anythng
Camera is also on a betr side...
Added slow motion and hyperlapse...and yehh 4k recording....from its predecessor
Overal...a 4.5 on 5
Not suggested for a hard core gamer

Overall performance of the mobile is just above average. When it comes to rate the individual specs, fingerprint sensor can be improved on as one has to take extra effort to unlock the mobile with fingerprint. Though camera is highly rated, the images captured are not up to the mark when compared with it's competitors. Same goes with battery life as well, though it's said that it's got a mighty battery it would last not more than a day for someone who doesn't use mobile Soo frequently for gaming or streaming videos

The SAMSUNG GALAXY M30s is excellent device really SAMSUNG done a good job.
It's best thing is it's big and powerful battery that gives long battery life to phone and the processor is very smooth that never lags your phone and even you play heavy game on this device it handles and rest part of the phone that its Camera, Memory,RAM are also very good.
I personally experienced all this which i have written and the main thing is that it fits in your budget.
Allover the phone is excellent .I recommend to all who wants the small budget with big surprise.
THANK YOU

Within 20days of purchase there was issue in charging the phone. Service centre guys told that pba board needs to be changed as it is defective. I contacted samsung customer care to change my set but the response is very poor. Didn't expect such a unprofessional behavior from Samsung. Don't know what to do further.

Hello guyys
I will recommend to buy this phone because it has premium design and feel as well as there are no performance issues as well as no lag in gaming but camera is not upto specifications provided and it is like 16mp camera with bassels.
Camera is not up to mark.

1. 50gb free storage
2. 6000mah battery but ends in 1.5 days
3. Samoled display is good
4. Sound quality is low and no changes when dolby atmos feature is enabled.
It feels like dolby atmos doesn't works.

Its such an amazing phone at the price point that Samsung is offering. Good to see their competitive pricing like that of the redmis and realones. Better to go for a Samsung product rather than brands because its a great phone and Samsung has great customer service and care centres. My phone fell down and I had damaged my display. It was fixed within a few hours. Had it been some other brand, they would have taken 5-7 days or even more to get me my phone. Overall a 5 star experience using the product as well as an amazing customer service experience

AMOLED screen is awesome
fingerprint sensor works very smoothly
No heating issues so far .
Superslow and hyperlapse camera feature is awesome.
Sound quality is good
Cons :

Samsung Galaxy 30s is really worth for money. With lower price we can get multiple options like high Camara quality 64mp, 6000mah battery and other highly useful regular options presented in this mobile.
I'm enjoying with the mobile options.
Moreover, with my feedback my two more friends were also purchased in Dussehra offier as well. I will refer to this mobile who were going purchase at this price.
Thanks to Samsung and Amazon to bring it to customers.

Excellent phone at a reasonable price. Both front and back Camera quality is Excellent. Battery is a real monster as it comes for 1 and a half day when you charge 100% with moderate usage. Touch and feel of the mobile is good. At this price it is the best in the market. It could have been better if the night mode works while using a theme also. Overall an excellent phone at this price.

Just a quick advice from my side, I am not sure if you have read other positive or negative reviews  but listen to me no one in this world is going to give you this kind of beast #M30S....
All others complaining for camera, battery etc are totally noobs and don't know how to use this creature.
All other saying mi,realme etc. don't know the taste of super amoled , Samsung flagship and the guarantee that it will run till 3-4 yrs easily.
Don't listen to these noobs ,I say just buy it.
Loving it totally...

I have just bought this phone and packaging was not good as external polythene was old, phone box was torn at edges,bill invoice was torn.then also I didn't return it I kept this phone.
About phone:-
Worst front and rear both cameras, it's not 16mp front it's like 5 mp.
48 mp has not more pixels when we zoom in photos are not clear it's like 8 mp camera.
My previous phone Redmi 4 has better camera quality and battery life than this.
Mostly disappointed on camera and battery life and packaging.

Actually first time I buyed Samsung product , but samsung fooled/cheated me😐 ,,,,the only best thing in this phone is display, camera👎 (very worst at low light) ,battery not as expected👎,,atlast i decided , never ever I will buy samsung products, REDMI, NOTE 7 PRO is faaaaar better then this, actually  initially I ordered that only due to phone pe and axis
card offer  i got it for 10k but by looking the features of this M30s I cancelled that phone even ready to pay more amt than redmi,, really I did a big mis5

M30s is an amaazing mobile phone which has best OS. Personally i love the OS and body material. 6000 mAh battery runs for a long day with continuous use. The camera features are best. It contains slow motion and super slow motion effects. Pubg can be played in high graphics. But there is a frame rate problem in HDR graphics in pubg game. Some features are best like unnecessary apps can be zipped, duplicate files can be deleted automatically and device care which can optimize device. So all over it is very good device.

I am writing this review after 2 weeks of using Samsung M30s.

Mobile is excellent in terms of battery, aesthetics, camera and other features but one problem i faced is network issue. I encountered same issue after getting replacement as well.

Signal strength is always more than -90dBm sometimes cross -100 as well which is very weak. If you can able to call or receive calls , what the point of using mobile even if it has other better features?

Fingerprint reader quality is awesome camera quality is also very good amoled screen is awesome but when it comes on the battery side i would say its back up is pretty good for songs and video player meanwhile mobile data on will drain the battery very fast.

First thing in this mobile,phone display it is amazing because of super amoled.

Battery is 6000mah but it can only last for 21hrs if u see videos for at least 5 to 6hrs.
Otherwise if ur using only for phone calls,browsing and WhatsApp then it can last for 30hrs.

Finger print unlock is very good for this price.

Camera: coming to camera it is good for outdoor photos but when u take in indoor it is not so good,but I'm ok with it because of this price u can't expect like iPhone clarity.

So overall i give rating for this phone 4.3/5

Front camera is very poor like a 2 MP camera.
(16 MP is only in pen and paper. All images taken with front camera look horrible like those clicked on a 2 MP camera)

This is without any doubt the best phone in this price range. I have never been a samsung fan but this phone is really nice. I am writing this review after one month of usage.
Battery lasts for 2 days if you are using it all the time even longer if you use it less.
Front camera is amazing, back camera is average (not bad though). Front camera is better than the back one.
Touch and sensors are really nice.

First of all,received before scheduled delivery date so thanks for speedy delivery.
Looks: very smooth look.
Camera: best than any other brands in this price range.
Performance: 6 GB RAM makes it run like knife on butter.
Fingerprint sensors are very smooth.
Battery: One of the best features which we require in today's mobile, fast charging and long battery life makes it perfect.
5/5 stars for Samsung.

Although the mobile is quite good according to the price but the specifications are not justified very accurately. 48 mp camera is not that good if one is interested in photography. The selfie camera also needs so much of optimizations to work properly. But if camera is not the main point of this smartphone for you and you are not that much heavy user or gamer then this the perfect phone for you. The sAmoled display and 6000 mah battery are the best part of this mobile.

Using this Phone from a month now,
Its killing smooth, and awesome.

Wide angle and slow motion are wonderful.

Also finger print scanner is super fast, just touch and booom.

One more wonderful thing is one handed mode, where you can minimize the size of your UI in one corner and use it with one hand.

battery is Damn good, no worries for 2 days at least after full charge, that too with fast charging adapter.
I also like the UI, look and feel of phone

5 🌟

Thank you Samsung.

I received this samsung M30s very next day to my hand. I have been using past 6 days this mobile.  Display is very unique amazing on this price segment which gives premium view. About "camera quality" is cool 48 megapixel worthy to take shots in day time and slow motion was great one. For me casual  use "battery life" comes 2 day left by 15% still. Performance is best I ever seen. Samsung UI still best. "Fingerprint reader" faster than other mobile.  Best mobile in this price segment o would say. #SamsungM30sBestMobile2019 #HonestReview

This is the secondary device I had bought to supplement Samsung Galaxy S10 plus....after 1 day of use, I am really shocked to find the quality of the device.Display is comparative to my S10plus....tremendous battery life...camera is very good for a phone below 15 thousand....Hats off to Samsung to provide the this phone for life time for a user like me who always believe in changing of phone with in 6 months....
Don't think twice....buy it ,you will not repent. This is my guarantee.

In terms of performance M30S is just amazing. It is equipped with best camera in its prise range. Amoled display is just superb and it's unbeatable.
Colour combinations is mesmerising.
In terms of value for money it's overwhelming.
It's modes are amazing and it's very different in compare to the same price range.
The only down side is it's battery management system. Although it has 6k battery it lasts for 2 days for normal uses. It takes a lot of time to charge.

Rest is a master piece.

Fingerprint is fast but sometimes it doesn't work properly but face unlock is very fast. Just one look and phone is unlocked. So complaints about camera i would just say it's amazing with all flagship camera features and modes and it's quality. Battery life is just awesome a simgle charge is enough to use through a day with lots of gaming and all. I just loved it. Awesome in this price segment. Choose Samsung instead of choosing all those those chinese brands like mi and oppo and vivo. M30s proves why it is a brand.

Awesome super amoled display
Monster battery
Decent rear cameras.
Decent performance
Decent power packed SOC (chipset)

The big problem is bad performance by front facing camera and rear cams not good enough in low light.
Also no compass sensor a big minus for using maps.
Auto brightness is not good showing very bright but not bad.

Good alternative for Chinese counter parts.

Over all decent budget power-packed phone by Samsung and also great for music lovers and multimedia. After using my rating is 4/5.

1.Display:sAmoled display is excellent and gives a best feeling while viewing the screen which is cool to eyes.
2.Camera:Both front and rear camera are good,capturing the candid pictures.
3.Battery:As the flagship name itself says it's a monster and so it is,which is lasting for 2 days.
4.Design and Build quality is amazing although the battery is 6000 mAh the mobile feels light in hand.
5. Altogether an excellent product and a terrific product.Worth every Penny!!! 😀

M30s is by far the best mid range available across all the manufactures right now. Samsung has unrivaled built quality and reliability. Camera and display are abobe the competition. I have bought two hansets for my family members.

1. Beast Battery ( 6000mAh) which easily lasts for around 2 days.
2. Spectacular and Superior Display ( Super Amoled ) 1080p !!!
3. Creative Cameras with various unique options ( SuperSteady + SuperSlowMo )
4. Simple and Reliable One UI ( Fast &amp; Smooth ).
5. A trusted brand and a product manufactured in our own country ( # Make in India ).
Thank you for reading.

The call speaker right above the front camera is very small and is like a small hole and can be easily blocked by dust or any such small particals resulting in blockage of sound in a call. Apart from that the phone's worked pretty well. Dolby Atmos is a feature that I really like. The camera doesn't seem like 48pixels initially but once you zoom in you can see the clarity and details unpixelated. So, I have no complaints against the camera. 6000 mAh offers a long usage and lasts easily for a day or two. I guess you can say you get the value for money if not more.

I'm very disappointed by Amazon this time. I've used this phone for just 2 months, and it suddenly became unresponsive. The touch is not working and due to which the phone can't be unlocked. Its become completely unresponsive and I can't hard reset the phone also. Due to the lockdown I can't even visit a service centre. Its really disappointing that a Samsung product becomes unresponsive in just 2 months. I need a proper solution for this.

Best phone in this range fast and snappy
Camera is subtle you don't have an option to switch to 48mp cam it's by default
Performance is best at this range doesn't lags even when u play PUBG 👀great ram management
In hand feels a bit heavy due to battery may be doesn't feel premium bcoz of its plastic back but can be compromised regarding the price point of view
Go for it if u want a better battery life, moderate gaming and routine usage
Go for redmi note 8pro if want camera too
Best of luck

As far as my phone is concern, which I bought 30 days back from Amazon, Outer frame is bit loose, making noise whenever pressed. Front camera quality is not up to the mark as everyone is telling. Rear Camera is OK.
Front Camera is not at all upto the mark!!! Wonderul Battery life. Wonderful SuperAmoled Display. AND THE CHALLENGE IS TO FIND SUITABLE TEMPERED GLASS AND BACK COVER WHICH ARE COMPATIBLE WITH EACH OTHER. CHANGED 3 TEMPERED GLASSES ALREADY. BACK COVER AND TEMPERED GLASS OVERLAP, TEMPERED GLASS IS COMING OUT EVERYTIME. HOPE AMAZON WILL SUGGEST FOR COMPATIBLETEMPERED GLASS

Fingerprint  reader and face detector is very fast and it will open within fraction  of mili seconds for camera quality I will give u also 5 rating  because some best photos I have clicked in M30s I couldn't  expect  better than this like Dslr camera and battery  life is amazing when I purchased and fully charged at night after 1 whole day working on my new mobile playing games and also surfing  net but battery  still remains upto 65 % and on next day I have charged at 7 PM but at that time also battery remains 15% I give ☆☆☆☆☆

I was using Samsung J7Pro. Switched to another Samsung Product after 2 years and am more than happy with this one. I have an extensive usage and am surprised to have such an awesome and unbelievable battery life.
Camera exceeds all expectations.

Could not ask for a better product at this price. Another master piece from Samsung.

Camera is decent, selfie is not good. Processor is good for general use but GPU is weak hence gaming is not much better. Battery life and display quality is awesome. Build quality is not good, plastic back feels very thin on pressing.

Hello Samsung management,  if you are reading  this review please note that I am a loyal user of Samsung  from 10 years back &amp; truly amazed with this product. But sir the following  mentioned  points  need to be upgraded at your next update essentially.
1. Battery stability  not like 6000 mah, hardly 1 day it can be used &amp; requires  improvement through update.
2.  Face unlock &amp; fingerprint  scanner  need to be improved.
3. Front camera updates requires 16 MP not so good as per the specs.
Kindly ensure  the same at Samsung  next software  update.

Bought its 4/64 varient in the last week of September, 2019. Performance is quite satisfactory. Design is impressive.
Charging once is sufficient for the whole day usage while surfing on net and watching videos.
Camera results are fine.
Smooth in operating multi functions at one time.
Grip, weight, looks are good.
Some disappointment is there for fingerprint sensors. It could be more sensitive.
But over all a good product value for money. Getting the desired results.
Thanks to Amazon for it's on time delivery.

Camera :
Camera quality is awesome although night mode is quit obscure.
Slow motion, super slow motion and hyperlapse features in camera augmented the  video variations  which makes it an interesting mobile among the similar Price range mobiles

Battery durability more than 24 hrs when continuosly used to snap photos and videos. M30s has indeed
 made my life easy in my recent goa trip.
Many other user friendly features

The plastic body feels very cheap,it makes clicking sound if you press the side panel of the phone..I have complained to Amazon and they sent technician to inspect..he said the sound is there but it doesn't affect anything..but why should I live with a phone which makes such sound like a fake mobile phone For kids..very disappointed with the built quality

I am using this phone since 1st Oct. In this price range, there are many companies who provide more efficient feature. Actually I prefer brand value. I brought this product due to Samsung and long battery life as per promo. In this price range, at that point of time, that was my choice. Authentic user may try this. It is user friendly but I expect more in respect of camera quality and in case of samsung it's a 4000 maH not 6000 maH. Conclusive statement will be posted after at least 3months use. But, SAMSUNG is Mr. Dependable for me.

M30s is a satisfied purchase. There are no headphones included in the box. The material is all plastic, not cheap though. Cameras are average.
What's really impressive though are the screen, battery and performance. For 15k, it's quite a reasonable buy.

My rating 4.5 stars
Go for it.

Writing this review after a month's usage
1.Battery : Really awesome and we'll deserved performance.
2.Camera : Not so great but decent enough.  Need some improvement.
3.Performance : Plays pubg in medium settings smoothly without any lag and lags a bit in higher settings
Remaining all the features are awesome and I am very much satisfied with the phone overall performance and other features
In this price range I can say this is the best compared to mi and realme

Got back to Samsung after a loooooong time and realised how much I missed from my favorite brand.  The M30s is real value for money.  Transfer of data from old phone was smooth and effortless with the new Smart Switch, I was migrating from Mi to Samsung and had no issues.  The battery life is amazing, lasts full two days as claimed , such a relief from searching for powerbank by the end of the day !!  The Camera is good and easy to use, switching from one mode to another is just a swish away.  Overall a fantastic product and nice to be back to my comfort zone.  M30s rocks

i am using from last two month and my experience is very bad. i was wanted to just quit chini brand but i think there is no option in this price.
thnx.

Samsung Galaxy M30s is very good phone at a competitive price. I have been using this phone extensively for the past one week and I am thoroughly impressed. It offered me exceptional battery backup with a crisp looking display and a camera setup to match and at times outdo the chinese competitors.
Highlights-
•Excellent 2 day battery life
•Quality camera setup with very good color reproduction and details
•Super amoled display
•Competent processor
•Good build quality
•Lightweight despite the humongous battery
•Samsung brand value

Power saving mode actually great and it shows real estimates with three different option of power saving mode. Switching of network for use of mobile internet is made almost instantantaneous. Super camera quality and you get sharp images and you can focus more on objects. You get stable Video.

For the 48 hours the battery gave me ... my eyes feel fresh and i have a smile on my face bacuase of the samoled display. Thank u samsung for it.

In 13000 rupees it is a miraculous phone. No heating issue no camera issue. UI is smooth as butter. Hence it is a perfect phone which everyone ahould have in thier hands.

It's battery backup is very amazing. It supports my highly pixilated games outstandingly. It's fingerprint sensor and face recognition sensor is very smooth and fast.Camera quality and speaker is also excellent. Supports videos greatly. It have regular updates in every 1 to 2  months. Charger is also working good. SAmoled is display is also same as when I purchased it. I have no problem with this Samsung Galaxy M30s. It is worth of money. I suggest everyone to buy this. Hope it helps.

After one month  usage,  its an ok product  for 11500  i bought  it after  offerings, a little  heavy because of the  6000mah battery,its good in camera quality and battery life, that i gets two days complete backup on an above average  usage. Sounds quality is good with headphones but in speaker mode its not that much and while calling its ear and mouth  speaker  are not up to the  mark,  some  time the mobile is getting  hot while charging and using internet. Overall  an averge product

I was never expecting that  a mid range Samsung  phone  can be this  good. Starting  with its look, quite attractive, surely gonna  impress  you. Coming to features, i must say it is a great competitor  to oppo, vivo, Xiaomi and all in this range. Camera is quite satisfying. Battery back up is not as good as 6000 mah suggests, but it is good enough and lasts  more than one day. In this phone what i like the most is split screen feature, smart view feature and many more which i was not expecting in Samsung phone. Overall, i will say a great phone in its range. Go for it.

Good for every generation of people. face lock works perfectly along with finger scaner.

I was looking for a new smartphone in affordable budget, this phone is perfect for a price range of approx 15000. The specs are top notch,
Battery-Monstor battery 6000mah..Works for 1.5 to 2days.
Display-Amazing Super AMOLED display.Gorilla glass 3 protection.
Camera-Back camera captures Quality pics but with front camera pics are little over smooth.
Build - The colors are really fresh.But it has palstic back .
Performance of the phone is really good as I have 6gb 128 gb..Exynos 9611..
Overall it is the best phone at this price fom Samsung.

Phone is not value for money, or is more than value for money,
Pros:
1. Battery. Yes battery is best, goes through the Day without charging, sometimes more with medium usage.
2. Camera: first impression of camera is good.
3. Display: as always Samsung phones are best in terms of display.
4. Performance: great, unlike previous models it don't lag.
Cons:
1: after new update some apps are causing trouble, maybe with their upcoming update problem might be resolved.
2. Can't think of anything other.

Overall, a great phone. But after a few days of using, below are my observations
1) I am facing Bluetooth connectivity issues with my wireless headphone even after trying various options. Yet to try screen casting
2) Screen stories sometimes dont reflect the changes to preferences on topics made.
3) Keyboard swipe doesn't work in own.
4) Heats up after 1 or 2 hours of you tubing
5) no good wallpapers. Needs to be downloaded
But, the phone is a best choice in the price range. No regrets so far.

The phone is awesome, the issue is with Security Patch Level updates.  If you would want to use for corporate e-mail, then this phone is not updated with latest SPL, and may not support for corporate e-mail.  I had the same issue with Samsung A9 Pro, and its again with M30s.  I really disappointed as its not serving my basic need. Can anyone haveany suggestions please?

This phone is value for money and I am not sue why people are buying IPhone, One Plus etc. It has a 48 MPxl back camera and 16 Mpxl front camera. Camera quality is pretty good. The biggest plus of the phone is the 6000 mAh battery which makes the phone run longer without frequent charging. I could easily switch my apps and data from my old galaxy S8. To sweeten the deal I got RS 1000 cash-back and 10% instant discount with SBI debit card so in total reduce Rs 2700 from Rs 16,999. I couldn't ask for more.

Phone is good .But i feel strain in eyes while watching videos or just by using it. Never felt it in my moto g4 plus.Not a fan of 6.4inch screens would better prefer a 5.5 screen screen. As 6.4 is just stretching the video frames. Also i couldn't find encrypt phone option in this phone.There is strong protection option . But i don't think so its equivalent to "encrypt phone" as its just a check which can be switched on or off. Where as "encrypt phone" option of stock android. Encrypts all the files on phone takes roughly an hour and is irreversible.

Pleased to write review, worth buying the phone as it contains all the features that you need at a reasonable price. It was gift to my wife and she is absolutely delighted. Using this phone for almost for a month now, no issues at all. Superb battery life, almost 3 days for a charge with average use. Light weight and sleek model. Well done Samsung For the product and Amazon for the prompt delivery.

GREAT product! Simply superb at this price point.

If you're in search of a phone around 13k mark and don't want to go for a chinese brand, there's no better phone at this price point. The battery is amazing, charges fast enough, you get an OLED screen which can be used for "always on" feature, 64GB storage, decent camera, no heating wirh regular usage (I'm not a gamer, but used AR features), feels solid even though it is made out of plastic. A great phone overall

Pros:
&gt; Awesome battery life....lasts for 2 days after decent amount of use
&gt; Display is wonderful with a very pleasant experience while watching videos/movies
&gt; Rear camera works fine in outdoor sunlight conditions
&gt; Speed is upto the mark as no lag observed

Cons:
&gt; Battery charging takes almost three hours to get fully charged
&gt; Heating issue observed while using front camera during video calls
&gt; Camera quality is poor in low light conditions
&gt; Edges could have been of better build quality

Samsung M30S main camera 48 MP takes good quality photos in day light, but night photos are not good. Also when taking 48 MP photos takes 1.5 seconds to save it after clicking. 48 MP photos quality is like 32 MP in day light and 24 MP in night light.

Super Slow motion video can be recorded for few seconds only but it can record continues Slow motion video. Video quality in night is not good.

Other things are good as per price.

Camera quality is good but it doesn't perform that well in low light conditions.
There are some notifications issues like I don't get a ping sometimes when a message or something new is there. And when I play some songs on ganna music app it always have a notification sound whenever a new song is played or resume from paused condition.
When I play PUBG or COD after playing for 30-40 min game becomes unresponsive then I just had to restart and it work absolutely fine for hours.
But overall it's a good phone in this price range

SAMSUNG Galaxy M30s the monster battery of 6000 mAh is awesome for STUDENTS.
but

I don't think the TRIPLE CAMERA is much useful as it is showing.

The Quality of Rear Camera of 48 MP
doesn't seem 3 TIMES better than the Front Camera of 16 MP (16*3=48)

The Rear Camera is not popping out like other brands so it provides BALANCE and EASY TO KEEP.

OVERALL, there are SOME POSITIVE &amp; SOME NEGATIVE things about this mobile
HOWEVER at the prize of Rs. 13999 with the TRUST of SAMSUNG this mobile is a MUST BUY option.

If you are buying it for camera quality. Please do not buy. I am regretting and there is no return policy too. Hugely diasappointed.
Please do not mention that it has 48 mega pixel rear and front 16 mp when it clearly does not have any of them. Deceived.

What is use of buying a 6GB phone if you unbox it and found 3.6GB RAM is busy in handling Samsung application which you can't uninstall life time. Basically you are buying a 2GB slow phone which may work fine for few days and then same will happen, unnecessary updates and slowing down you phone. Also 18 GB is pre occupied with ROM. What is the use to pay such a high price. Camera is average. Touch and feel in no longer like a premium phone. Suggest you all to look for another options in this 17k range.

The absolute main highlight of the Galaxy M30s is its battery. The primary sensor equips a 48-megapixel sensor and an f/2.0 aperture. This camera captures images in 12-megapixel resolution and if you do want to click and image in the 48MP resolution you have to manually select the 48-megapixel mode from the aspect ratio option.
cameras and processor that the handset gives good competition to rivals. A good buy.

Display died in 5 months . Getting blank screen. Samsung service center accepted my phone for repair after proper inspection and later gave excuse that they didn't inspect properly and that mother board was damaged due to water spill.  Service center asked for 8500 for repairs. I am sure water was never spilled on the phone. I would never recommend any one to buy Samsung phones as you will never get service support during warranty

#GoMonster with its battery life ..it lasts very good.
Camera is average at this price.
Its little hard too find fingerprint sensor at back but it works faster.
 Problem about battery is that Samsung m30s use front camera for adaptive brightness,face unlock &amp; as motion sensor so "CameraLight" app can eat 15-20% battery itself.(it may be vary depending on usage).

To get this solve i personally stopped using face unlock,motion sensor (phone automatically lights up when you pick) &amp; adaptive brightness....No battery usage from "CameraLight" app.

Speed and performance of mobile looks good so far, battery stands good. Camera have some good features like changing background for portrait pictures, but photo clarity and focus is not as expected, it's is the place where M30S has to improve lot. I will camera as 2/5 &amp; other features as 4/5.

fingerprint reader is ok, camera is good on daylight with 48 mp camera only, video recording is ok.. facing to much heating problem while using camera in low network area.. battery backup is not looks 6000 mah, only a little better than my earlier samsung phone "Galaxy On Max"  Amazon replacement policy is very bad.. their application deny all problem and gives only result " phone is normal" and deny replacement.

not facing heatung issue is normal network area...

I was using samsing J7 previously and then thought to try a different brand this time. However, Samsung M30S caught my attention and again i got Samsung and am really satisfied... love ds phone.

Camera: back and front cameras are awesome.  The focus and image quality  is very good

Screen quality  is very good

The battery is able to stand for 2 days with regular  usage

This is high end mobile. It is very surprising that Samsung sold it for very low price.

Amazing phone with top notch features in budget pricing. Battery life is beyond imagination. Camera is surprisingly good for this price range. Samsung SAMOLED Display is fantastic as always. Looks premium in the hand. The feel and experience of One UI is amazing. Feels at par with the top flagship Galaxy S10. The phone weight is a little on the higher side, but can't complain given the battery capacity. Glass body could have been icing on the cake. Nevertheless, the phone is a bang for your buck. Way ahead of competition, would recommend without any second thoughts.

Thank you SAMSUNG, for providing such a fantastic mobile with this price. As per my last many years experience in using mobile phones I found this phone awesome.
I can say surely this mobile is value of Money. Even SAMSUNG is also a great brand there is no doubt in this.
If I'll say something about dislike than in everything there will be some dislike things but if I'm getting satisfied with this product than I think no need to share the dislike things which are minor and less however if I'm getting better response with using it.

Sad movement 😔

Its been 4 days using the this samsung mobile 30 s. I would say the reason i bought this phone was the battery back up and samsung gave what it promised the battery last for almost two days charging . 48 mp camera is good though i have not taken much of selfies to know the front camera . The amoled display makes the phone look more classy and good to use. Not a very light phone but not too heavy . I think its the best phone that i got in ghis budget agter all discounts at 12k .  6000mah + 3 camers+6'4 screen +amoled display and more.
Worth buying in this budget .

Monster battery helps in busy life avoiding need of carrying power bank. The fingerprint is also quick responsive. I did like the new OneUI, refined for better experience complemented with sAmoled U display.

Complete package and Amazon assurance.

The screen of the phone is the most amazing thing. The 6000mAh battery gives you the freedom from power banks. The amazing thing about the phone is its not at all heavy even though it has such a massive 6000mAh battery. The camera as 3 lenses: the wide lens is soo amazing. The pictures taken from all 3 lenses are really of good quality and clarity.

The only shortcoming is the camera doesnt have inbuilt shutter speed control.
Overall I loved the phone. Its really great that samsung can provide all amazing features and such a great phone in just 14k.

Purchased on 28th.. Got it on 30th...sold on Olx on 1st

Exceptional device considering the price range.. But if you are a selfie maniac like me, consider another option.. Coz selfie 16mp shooter is not up to the mark compared to other mid rangers.

Also some of the built in feature like edge lighting, side bars etc
It's seems to be a trimmed version of one UI

Otherwise..,
Back camera ✔️
Screen ✔️
Sapphire Blue back glossy ✔️
Speaker volume✔️
App closing opening in 6GB ✔️

I think this is the best from the samsung in this price segment.Battery is giant and easily last for 1.5 to 2 days.One ui is optimised and lag free phone is fast and functons smoothely.Camera is pretty nice thanks to the triple camera and some useful features like super slow motion etc.front camera is nice as well.
It doesnt feel heavy despite its giant battery so nice work from samsung.I was confused early to buy it but i think i made a good choice.Thank you

i tried the following but still the problem existing, it will not be overcome unless there is OTA update, highly disappointed, no value for money.

1-Reset network setting.
2-Go to Safe mode and check the issue persist because it may be due to some other APP's running in the background (usually third party apps)
3- Factory data reset.
4-Finally take the device to the Samsung service center.

Decent phone, worth the money, does the job pretty well.
Redmi and other Chinese brands can expect a fierce competition from Samsung through this model in this range.
Battery easily lasts for two days with moderate usage and that's what Samsung prioritized in this product.
Works smoothly without much lags, decent display and performance.
The main noticeable drawback would be the camera. Photos lack clarity and do not look 48 MP at all.
No complaints though, can't expect an all perfect model at this price point.

Best ever phone from Samsung, fingerprint reader is really smart and right on the money, cameras are elegant too, everyone who see this phone want to check its cameras first..and battery life is good 3 days and nights with full use, another awesome jewel from Samsung...

Pros: *Good camera quality and battery life for the given price
*one of the best mobile in this price range..

Cons: never use this mobile without a screen guard (although no one prefers using naked mobile, but I used and broke the screen 😕 although it fell just from pocket to floor when I sat on floor😡. Thank god I got a free insurance while buying 🙃), the screen is too sensitive to break .
 But no need to worry if you put the proper screen guard.

Overall It's one of the best mobile for this price range

Best value for the money paid. Very nice mobile phone. Batterlife is very good and it consumes only 7% percent of battery when used for one hour continuously.  Camera is good. All the inbuilt features are excellent. Memory is huge . I have to mention the sound where you don't need any speaker.  It is excellent. Screen saver is very nice with different pictures which don't repeat at all.

While inserting simcard First read the booklet properly and do . Then it's easy or else it is difficult to find.

It's an amazing mobile handset driven by Samsung. I have used so many earlier brands earlier but this handset is uncomparable to what I had been using earlier. Its specifications, speed, battery, storage, finger print touch and the feel is amazing. All that I can say I get a "Wow " feeling when I using this handset. A big thank you to Samsung team and Amazon for their wonderful services. I have recommended to my friend circle and they too have purchased in altogether 5 handsets. Would wind up with a big thank note💯💯💥

Everything is best about this mobile ! Especially display is great. After using this display you will find display of every other mobile dull, such is a best display of this mobile.
Camera quality of selfie, i didn't like.. It's so so..i use POCO F1 camera with Google camera, this is best camera i ever seen (poco). That may be reason i didn't find camera of M30s not so good.

1) Battery life is good enough
2) fast charging is also good
3) camera is ok in natural light but not up to mark in artificial light (we can say camera is not very good)
4) face scanner is ok
5) finger print reader is very bad. Whenever use after a long time when phone remains idle it does not work.
6) display is very good but auto brightness adjustment is not good
7) feel on hand is very good
8) not very heavy while including such a big battery

Samsung launch very attractive mobile in this price range, blue light filter, Dolby atoms, don't disturbe, night mode, ultra data saving etc are very useful, battery charging fast &amp; long life, processor is also good, screen &amp; color is superb, 64gb internal storage is also fine but only camera little bit lack. Overall this mobile is far better in this price range than other Chinese models i.e. Mi, Xyomi, oppo,vive,realms, Redmi etc.
Thanks

Recommended settings:
Change display mode to Vivid.
Set beauty mode and all skin releted setting to 0, it will improve front camera quality.

Pros :

2. Amazing battery backup
3. Great Cameras for outdoor clicks
4. Buttery smooth one UI
5. Does not feel heavier with 6000mAh battery
6. Looks amazing
7. Dedicated slot for micro sd

Cons:
1. Small charging cabel
2. No headphone, back cover provided in box
3. Front camera for indoor lighting could have been better

Fingerprint is slow to respond compared to my 2 year older mobile
Camera quality is normal compared to today standard
Battery  life is good

Phone is very heavy . Don't buy if you are not interested  in carrying  a big phone
They provided only 5v adapter and they are cheating  by saying 15v adapter
Better to avoid this phone I couldn't  return due to bad return policy for phones

The camera is pathetic..selfie camera takes 1 min to open...wen switched to wide angle on selfie it always says camera failed. I don't understand why when it doesn't work have given that feature.
Phone reboots automatically whenever doing any banking transactions. I have not seen such a pathetic n non standard phone. I thought the reviews are worth seeing but seems that has been manipulated..I am sorry but it is wat I feel now after using this phone.

Samsung galaxy M30s has the best battery life compared to all the other phones which I  used previously,  camera is working good for me as I have the fetish to click pictures of different different things everyday and different options for differentkind of picture makes me feel like a professional, This phone is in budget and  has full display screen. I like the feature of face detection and how it works so smoothly.
I love this phone and I would like to rate it as the best one till now.
Thank You

The sapphire blue variant looks amazing. Overall build quality is amazing. Performance wise it's pretty decent and can play a variety of games at high settings. 6000mah is just an overkill and there's an option to enable night mode (black theme) which I'm really fond of. I'm not really fond of clicking pictures but the camera has various features and click options and the quality looks superb. I'm really glad that Samsung launched such an amazing phone at this range so why even bother looking at other brands like honor,redmi etc.

The phone is very nice especially the battery life and the display.

The display quality is very good and offers an immersive experience when watching movies or playing games .

And when enjoying your favourite movie your phone battery dies that's a very disappointing thing but on the Samsung m30s that won't happen because of its massive 6000mah battery .

This phone is truly a monster and offers a monstrous user experience hand down.

Used it for last 10-12 days.. Battery life is great. It lasts for two to two and half day. Samsung sAMOLED display is the best, colors looks pretty amazing. Both fingureprint and face unlock is fast. Samsung UI is the thing which is why I alwats bought samsung phones and in the OneUI is no exception.. it it easy and user friendly UI. The only con is camera which is not that much great and feels like 13 megapixel camera. When you zoom the picture it starts to pixelet. But the other features are great like super steady video, slow mo and super slow mo.

"Really resembling the name Monster"
1.48 mp rear camera + 8mp wide &amp; 5mp depth  actually gives best lively crispy result in its class.
2. Finger print sensor work in a flash speed and great result in comparison to rebel Chinese mobiles.
3. Battery life result is actually amazing, it didn't die for two days and charging is also in fast manner. In fact a real companion to everyone in busy daily life.
Thanks to Samsung to introduce such an enriched budget fone to reach common man through Amazone, i feel really great and proud deal in my life.

Actually,  I thought these many features at this cost is impossible in Samsung models. But after buying,  I changed my mind. This is excellent mobile I bought. One month back I also bought Samsung A30. But features are far from it. Camera is superb and battery life is as expected,  it too long to recharge again. I am waiting , when will discharge.  Overall mobile is fantastic. I received it on 17 OCT. Delivery is very much fast. If you are looking for battery,  camera and performance  blindly opt for M30s.

The phone is smooth, great battery and good SAmoled screen for such a competitive  price. Got this one for a pretty good deal at Amazon, and was delivered on time. Wouldn't recommend for heavy users though but for people who wants to listen to music, stream videos...this guy will stand up for ya.. cheers to Samsung and Amazon for a good product.

Pros
1. Super Amoled display
2. 14 hrs of battery
3. One UI

Cons
1. Camera ( although I don't mind about camera and gaming)
2. Gaming is bit dull ( great at medium graphics)

If u are a student it is must buy in this price segment. I brought this phone because of I bored of my old device (MI). If u are using MI phones for the first time.. U can prefer REDMI NOTE 8( If u are fine with LCD SCREENS).

A few minor software updates could work wonders on the device. The response isnt that great. Camera can be improvised. Coping a number from contact is a hassle. With the tap or long press pops the option to copy but you would never be able to tap on it. And would have to simply read n type. Coping otp from notification bar even isnt there. MI user interface felt better than this to me. Had more expectations from Samsung. Overall the battery lasts me a day at ease. And gets me going on the way at relief.

Got this mobile with great offer from Amazon. Its been 2 week using this phone here are few points:
Pros:
* Great battery backup.
* if you put your phone on flight mode at night it will hardly discharge 1% of battery.
* No hang so far.
* video play quality is really good. full screen mode is nice.

Cons:
The only con I faced is that they don't provide back cover and in only 2week I can see some scratch on body. since its a new pone its not easy to find good back cover so early.

As usual the phone is excellent.
But two faults I found:
1.  display of the net speed status is not built.
2. catching of tower signal very poor. If you connect mobile net signal strenth is comedown to two lines. if you can use for call full singnal line will appear.

Overall phone is ok

I have a horrible experience with this phone. I ordered the phone in January in india. I did not use it for couple of months as my other phone was still working fine. In March when I tried to use it, the phone kept restarting on it own every few minutes. I tired few steps mentioned in the Samsung community websites. To my surprise it went from bad to worse. The phone switched off on its own and won't turn on. I realised I made big mistake by buying a samsung product.  Won't recommend this phone to anyone.

This phone is absolutely amazing in all aspects. Giving this review after 2 months of usage.  Battery performance is really superb, solidly battery lasting for minimum 2days even after Games, Video calls etc..,  Till now I haven't seen any lagging in performance.  I purchased this phone after  lots of comparisons and reviews..  For this budget this phone is 100% worth...

Amazon delivered this as committed in a safe way, thanks to Amazon team for their excellent service and support as always....

Phone is good as per specification,  but I am using since 10days and feel there is network connectivity issue in the handset , not getting proper call and voice even at same location and same network performing well .  Most of time  low network .

Samsung tech team should have to review may be issue in software or in operating system .

Everything is good. Best part is the color of charger that is black, it looks super cool, was getting bored of seeing only white charger of samsung. Camera quality is awesome. With 6000mAH battery one can enjoy full day without taking tension about charging again and again. Touch is also good. Many new features have been added by samsung under motion and gesture. This is the best phone available at present in the market with this price tag that too with samsung brand. Only drawback is weight of phone which is Slightly heavy, other than that there are no issues.

Never buy a Samsung Mobile phone
This is the second time I have faced this issue.
Oppo Vivo products are better than Samsung these days.
Its just 3rd day I had to sell this phone for a loss of 5000
Camera useless
Display usless
No inbuilt finger print scanner

Like: 1.  Camera-never been so satisfied with camera in a phone.  2.  Screen- Samoled is the best for viewing photos and videos 3.  Battery-2 days for normal usage on a full charge and 1 day for a very heavy usage.  Good call quality  and very good sound output quality via headphones.  Watched Amazon prime fhd video without any lags n crystal clear picture.  Am not a gamer so no comment on that.
Dislike: finger print scanner could have been better.
Dunno y the reviewers are throwing such negativity.  Btw r they really qualified to review?  Just asking.

It's a good mobile. But the camera quality is not good enough during night. Fingerprint  sensor is not also good enough. It takes 1 or 2 seconds to sence your finger. Battery life is very good. I used to charge it once in 3 days. For any normal use you would not have to worry about the battery. Over all it's a good phone. It looks very nice if you consider the looking. And a good news, in April samsung is going to give this model One UI 2 upgrade with android 10 update. That's impressive. Thank you.

This phone is a battery beast, no matter how much you use it refuses to die. The processor is also brilliantly power efficient. Fingerprint sensor is good. Camera quality is decent enough as per this price range. It doesn't disappoint in any respect. We need such competitive products from samsung. Excellent

Extraordinory phone.
Pros :
No heating issues
Long battery life (for 2 days)
6GB RAM (good performer )
128 GB internal storage.
Cons : Feels little weight in your hand if you use it for long time (say continuously for half n hour ) But still its just 188 grams which is very less for a 6000 mAh battery.
Overall I give 5 out of 5 rating for phone and 4.5/5 for weight of the phone

After see others comment and star mark,I thought a good deal, but by performance it's not up to mark. The battery gives hardly 10hour performance  with internet access with providing hotspot to laptop.
The camera quality is average though 48mp ,images are not so high contrast, only the colour is natural.
I requested  Amazon for return, but with a software verification,  it shows OK,  no need to return.

Phone body :- 4/5
Battery life is too good. Samsung has done full justification  with 6000mah battery. AMD it usually  lasts longer than 1/1.5  days with continuous  use.
Camera quality is nice. The selling point of camera is it's  wide lens. The quality of picture clicked by wide lens is extremely  nice.
The in built speaker is good
Finger print reader works perfectly fine.. as a matter of fact the face recognition  is quite fast keeping in mind the range of the phone.
Overall  if you have a budget under 15000 this is what you want.

Worst mobile so far in my life since 2003.. worst battery life.. fastest in discharging slowest in charging.. it takes 3 mins to charge 1% and just few hours in discharged, my previous MI was very fast in charging and 24 hrs usage in one full charge... I purchased as I heard battery is good... Some celebrity challenges and all but biggest disappointment...

The phone has
1.An amazing battery life, it can easy last one and a half day of heavy usage
2.The super amoled screen makes the viewing experience soooooo much better
3. Gaming experience is pretty good
4.Being an iPhone user since 2012 I must say this phone as a whole different experience than other you have felt for a phone

Phone has some lag, sometimes will not be able to hear anything during call.need to restart phone and works fine. Build quality is ok weightless being 6000mah battery it's very light. Camera is great. Apart from camera I don't like anything in this phone.

The product is great.. everything is so damn good. 48 mp triple Camera.. samsung scored it beautifully..  6000 battery , slow to charge but awesome battery performance.. what else could you ask for than a screen replacement on breakage for a year.. overall feel is classy..
2issues..
Was using a lighter phone before so this was bit bulkier one.(due to breast battery maybe)
Secondly take 500 more and give headphones at least..  and should have given sim tray opening pin..only charger in the box.

Just to mention face unlock works awesome

I loved this camera quality, it was super duper good camera quality which i ever seen in my life, amazing experience with M30S...
Video quality also very good, for gaming also this phone very good, Pubg lover should buy this phone, bcz good battery backup line, I'm also Pubg lover that's why I told, I'm thinking i should buy one more M30S for my friend shahid at Bangalore..
I really appreciate Amazon for giving me Debit Card EMI (HDFC Bank).. Definitely I'll refer my friend nd clouges to buy this phone on Amazon.

Thanks Amazon

I've never actually been disappointed from Samsung products they are absolutely the best
This phone can run all your favouraite games as highest settings PUBG runs at HDR with High framerates
COD MOBILE also runs on best settings
And you can play for hours and hours due to the 6000mah battery
I charge my phone once every 2 days still with about 18-20% battery left
The 48 MP triple camera setup takes nice portrait Images me and my friends hand too much fun with it
It's a steal at this price

Writing this review after 6+ months of regular use of this mobile.
Performance - am not into much of a gaming but it didn't hand while switching through apps. Didn't hang even once.
Battery - After charging full it lasted up to 40-44 hrs.(I have been using internet, whatsapp, youtube extensively).
Camera - Excellent results in daylight and at illuminated places even in the night. Only in low light, it is good.

Overall I have a satisfactory experience.

Battery is excellent, no doubt in that, display is very good and overall performance is also good. Even the games are working smoothly as I have got bad reviews about gaming in this phone but till now I didn't get any problems,  asphalt 8, pubg is working very well with good graphics.

The only thing that I did not like is the
camera, it's not up to the mark as I expected. Back camera is good, front is Ok. Overall phone is good and value for money in this range.

I am a sansung lover andI bough this phone 3 weeks back. The main reason behind choosing this mobile is its battery. Till now my experience is not as good as I expected. Battery is not like 6000, it is just like other normal battery. camera is not very good. It has same problem which already exists in typical samsung mobiles.

Fantastic performance,  no heat after playing PubG, excellent look.... actually sexy!!!
But, I am not happy with Camera, it's better when it's outside and good whether (lighting), I am not getting good photos with 48mp Cam ( may be you should release guidance to use 48 mp Cam!)
Overall it's fantastic Mobile.

Good phone with awesome FHD display feels good.
Face and finger sensor unlock is fast feel satisfied.

Concerns....
### Unwanted ads and pictures on screen saver but I don't know how to get rid of this...really irretrating!!!!
#Battery getting heated in normal use which is looks disappointing!!!!! Battery life is average not so good as expected 6000mAh!!!!!
#Sim tray and other buttons are little shaking and not great fit on side..!!!!

Amazon Delivery : amazing, prime delivery in 20hrs
Display : sAmoled feels great to use even the touch sensitive is amazing
Battery : Best bet, 1 full day of regular use consumes at max only 50% of the 6000mAh battery
Camera : not as expected for 48mp, but good quality images in outdoor lighting, nightmode feature is also good
Biometric : fingerprint scanner and face recognition performs well
Performance : haven't faced any serious lags or heating issues yet.

Overall : got it for 11,500, sapphire blue. Best deal, go for it.

The Camera Quality  Of M30s Is Too Good ..
Battry Quality And Display  Clarity Is Awesome. No Device Can Gives You The Display And Camera And Gaming Performance  At The Price Range...
It Also Gives You The Fast Charging ...
And A Monster 6000mAh Battery.

Awesome  Phone From Samsung....
You will never think of buying another company's Smart Phone after buying Samsung Smartphone.

It's Really True....
I'm giving you some camera samples..

The phone performance is really good. Its fast, touch screen is very responsive. The camera quality is average and not upto the mark of 48 MP. The battery performance is disappointing. Being a 6000 MAH battery with moderate usage the battery is draining fast which should not be the case.
The screen size is too large and a bit difficult to fit in pocket. Samsung can optimize the screen size to may be 5.5 inches. The phone is quite heavy which is one more drawback for carrying.

Good phone in 14000, wonderful display .
Some problems is
1_ singles problems am using bsnl and jio both are am facing call breaks, voice not hear and mostly calls not connect.
2_ Dolby , there is no difference in using Dolby off and on
3_ battery drains,  6000mah battery comes only one full day 😝
4- fingerprint sensor is good
5_ camera  is perfect
 I didn't face any problem in camera.  Compare to others. Beauty is poor.
Picture  color super, portrait is good.

*Its built quality is very poor. Even the back plastic panel having a pop sound even you hold yours phone.
*Camera is not good.

Yeah this is a complete package i would say yhe the design is awsome and i really like the shapppire blue colour specially❤️❤️.

The processsor does a good job but not recommended for heavy games like pubg.

The fingerprint reader is fast enough to manage your daily lock - unlock process.

The camera is good☺️ but i thought of more details in the picture

The battery is a monster really......!!!.
Lasts more than 2 days easily.

This a awsome product in this price by Samsung.

One of the best phones in mid range.
So many cool features that i can't even write in details.
Camera quality is far better than previous m30 and fingerprint is damn faster than earlier.
The only lack is face recognition yeah it's working but not that quick but Yess this mobile phone gonna rock in Market with it's super impactable performance.
Thank you Amazon for delivering this on time.
Thank you.
If u r looking for awesome and cool Phone in mid range then m30s is best .

Look is very nice. Display is good. Camera is also good. But the battery backup is not up to customer expectation and assurance given by samsung. Some times it is getting hang. Any how it is worth value at this price of Rs.16999.(excluding offers).

Finger print reader is normally fast. Battery life is amazing due to 6000 mah battery but still Super Amoled display and exynos processor consumes a lot of battery. Camera quality is good but not as mentioned. It is 48mp triple camera but still photo fades at zooming. Color combination of sapphire blue is amazing and user interface of Samsung is always best. Pubg runs on high graphics without lagging which is great. Dolby atmos makes sound great while using headphone. Hoped for more gesture. Overall it have it's own pros and cons but still best in budget.

Im die hard Fan of Samsung brand. Im using samsung from last 13 years. Starting with Note2 to M30s.

Form screen quality to display with consideration of price, its market leader.

Screen quality Super amoled screen provides atpar experience in comparision to any other phone including iPHONE.

Camera sound storange  all are thebest.

Specially battery worked for me 2.5 day with contineouse sync and data active condition.

Sound is too god.

Phone is good, Batrry is typical as it shows 100% full in very less time it will drain faster up to 60 % , Samsung need to work more on it main camera if Samsung 12 mp camera can give best images then why don't 48 mp.all ither things are also not much good.
Please work on camera i am feeling like cheated both front and rear cameras are worst just because of ram and battery this mobile is not win the race this is just too much samsung did this time fake cameras fake advertisements and so many things are there i recommend if any one wants to buy this then please don't. In less price other better options are available in market.

The 48 Mp camera is good but not the best. The point mentioning worth is the Battery. It's a Beast when it comes to Battery life. The phone easily navigates between apps and no lag is reported.  The fingerprint scanner is ok. The display is classic at this price point.

I have been using this phone last one month. I should say this is the best phone on this price range!

1.Samsung's Super Amoled display is stunning on this phone, movie watching and videos are top notch!
2.Since I don't play games, this exynos 9611 is working great in day to day usage!
3.Samsung One UI is my favourite!
4.After using Samsung Galaxy 7562 and Samsung Galaxy J7(2015) for the past 7 years I can see a big difference and been having super experience through is M30s
-----
5.0 out of 5 stars

The Samsung galaxy m30s is a good phone that comes with 6000mAh monster battery and Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9611 processor..
It feels good in hand...
What i liked the most is its superAMOLED screen which feels like real.it supports 1080p.

If you are looking for a good phone, not much for gaming ,
For office use,for parents,and daily use.. etc  ..
Then it will not dissapoint you ...

It was my first samsung device and im having awesome experience with it.
Display is very nice with vibrant colors and saturation.
Speed is awesome and there is no such lags or hanging issues.
Battery is more than enough with heavy usage itself.
Only a major disappointment is with cameras both front and rear it is not that great but for this price segment this mobile is just
 a MONSTER.

Awesome phone in the budget of just 13999, finally samsung brought the best phone in this range, the fingerprint reader has a new and excellent feature to scroll ove to open notification bar, the camera quality is super awesome,  the night camera is stable, the Amoled display is wowwwwww.. and the best part is the battery, it has a massive battery of 6000MAH that actually lasts for 2 days. Overall best phone experience by now, its really handy and the look is damn good. Hats off samsung in love with this phone. #lovesamsungm30s

I don't like writing reviews but still m writing,. This might be helpful for the new buyers.
1.if u r camera lover then this phone is not for you
2. I saw many videos in which it is showing
great battery backup but the phone I've received is not giving battery backup as 6000mah should give
For every 5 to 6 minutes  of usage there is 1% drop in charging. If calculate it will give u a backup of around 7 hour which generally given by 35000 or 4000 Maher battered
3. Figureprint lock is also not upto the mark

I have been using this product from last 10 days and I bought tis phone only for its 6000Mh battery power. But to my utter disbelief and shock its battery life is the worst. Please don't buy tis phone if you are  looking for a better battery life. I wish I could have instead gone for a diff phone on same price. Apart from battery all others features are a plus for tis price. Complete dissatisfaction on battery front. The moment I switch on the internet my battery is reduced.

The phone is a monster when talking about it's beautiful display and a behemoth battery.
The phone performs well on day to day usage and even when put through a low to medium  gaming.
The only thing that's not up to the mark are the cameras. They work well with ample lighting but in low light the cameras fail to produce a decent photo.
As they say you have the cake and eat it too.
If you don't mind the camera then the phone is a perfect option and a great value at it's selling price.

I bought this phone and got delivered to me on Sunday 27 Oct. During first few calls I felt that mic is not working properly so I tested it via various GSM carriers and called multiple numbers. At last I came to conclusion that I should file a return of product but Amazon.in refused and redirected me to customer care and as usual after 2-3 attempts somebody had time to hear our problem but with no solution, she initiated to connect with senior and that never happened.

I suggest not to buy any expensive electronic item and return policy is really pathetic with equally poor customer care.

Used for 12 days m30s 6gb ram 128gb
Pros : Good battery life 1.5days minimum( usage playing pubg 5-6 hrs and long calls ,GPS on  and chatting)
Camera quality is good when pics taken outside.
Touch and processing is smooth.(15-20 apps open)
Cons: finger print doesn't recognize properly when there is moisture/ sticky fingers
Mobile width is more compared to others so takes time to get used to it
Without running any apps system eats 2.3 gb of ram out of 6
Overall it's a better product  compared to others at price 15k

The built in quality  is very good and the battery also . But as all samsung device should have some issues.  This is also not exception. Few of my games and apps like WhatsApp keep crashing  and automatically getting force close. But I used redmi and others never face those irritating issues.  Informed support team and they suggested to do factory reset. Like I don't have other job and keep doing reset and reset up everyday.

I gifted Samsung Galaxy m30s to my daughter on her Birthday.
The pictures clicked through this phone are very vivid not just in daylight but in the dark too. It's a great experience to use this phone especially because of it's long lasting battery life.
The previous phone had storage issues but with Samsung Galaxy m30s there's plenty of storage capacity. Be it sound quality, good battery, amazing wide angle and camera depth, fast processor definitely Samsung Galaxy m30s is worth every penny.

You will get an update and your phone will stop turning on, doesn't matter even if you factory reset it. So, don't rely on Samsung and seek other brands. I visited the service center, the guy there couldn't figure out the problem, then he blamed a minor dent on one of the corners and said that the warranty is rejected because of that. Samsung has pathetic customer service. Bought in October and dead by April. I am going to try redmi next, as I still have redmi 2 in working conditions after 7-8 years.

In a matter of just 3days, I have become fond of my Samsung M30S in terms of its various aspects like Battery Life, which goes on &amp; on every after rigorous use. It is very light in weight even though its heavy in Mhz. Its 48Megapixel Camera with predefined Effects is amazing &amp; can help u click a pic like a professional. I have ordered for the Sapphire Blue colour after seeing it on YouTube videos &amp; after getting in hand, it looks awesome, quite stylish &amp; different. Its resolution is excellent &amp; the best as compared to any other phone in this price range.

Phone is good ..A complete package for all things.
battery runs 2 days at normal usage,but while gaming it uses more ,battery not optimized for gaming...
..camera is also fine ..display is awesome..touch is good.

But there is problem in Samsung's processor i think that,it usually disconnect from wifi..

Camera is the worst part of this device. In artificial light it work as a 2mp camera. When I uploaded a video from this device to youtube you will be amazed that youtube algorithm took this video as 360p.
It is that bad.

Performance in day to day work is ok. But for gaming it's a biggggggg noooooo nooooo.. heats too much
You can buy much better phone at this price.

Battery is excellent.

P.s. do not listen to online reviews they are fake.
Out of 10 video only 1 or 2 telling you the complete truth.

This is my first android phone after using iPhone for a half decade. Waited so long to get phone after the announcement. And finally ordered this phone in rush not even considering bank offers in the sale started moment.

All I would say is.. this phone changed my -ve perception on 'samsung' brand all together. It's a only greatest smartphone in &lt;20k range in 2019. So far I almost bought 5 pieces of samsung m30s for my friends and family.

Thanks Samsung and amazing Amazon!!!

It is the best Samsung Galaxy phone under Rs-20,000, great battery life.
Pros-
Super amoled display- best in segment
6000 super monster battery- best in segment
Dolby atmos- immersive sound
Night mode- a Samsung unique feature
Cons-
Body design- Samsung m30s has lacked in this field polycarbonate  back is good but as compared to  glass body, it appears to be old fashioned
Camera- camera is very good but it should have more detailing

The most important  if you zoom your image it will blur so camera freak avoid this phone
Samsung may provide a back cover as most of phone are coming with it.
Overall phone is average.

BATTERY- 5/5
Display - 4.5/5
Performance - 4.5/5
Speed - 5/5
Gaming experience- 4/5

Great phone but lags sometimes. Camera quality is not the greatest in this range, but it is good. Battery life is awesome as I have many background apps running and it still holds for much longer time and fast charging is also cool. Other features are more or less equivalent to phones in same price band.

This is my first samsung phone.
I have been using this phone for more than 2 months. I am sharing my personal  experience.
Worst phone in terms of GPS Navigation, current location is updating very late.
If you are Camera person, then you can take this phone to use click snaps. Otherwise you can't rely on this phone for navigation.
Some will say that current location is Google maps issue, but same thing is working fine on other vendor device.

Not good as I expected from Samsung.
During call audio quality is not good both normal and speaker option, mobile gets hang and most important draw back is 4G signal quality while using internet. Eg. At my residence if I use my old redmi 4 mobile phone for 4G internet via airtel connection it's work with good speeds but on Samsung m30s  unable to connect or get the 4G speeds. It means this phone is dump for me when I try to use on my resedeance. Rating 2 star because of battery and display.

If anyone knows any solution please help me. I am not able to contact samsung customer care. I sujjest the people who need internet plz dont buy.

True to the tagline, the phone is really a monster. A power packed phone in an unbelievable price. The best thing about the phone is no doubt the battery but the camera is equally great. A true 48MP pro camera to capture breathtaking photos. A very useful powerful feature is the scrolling notification panel with fingerprint reader. I have been using it for almost a month now and loving it. Watching Netflix has become more amazing with the M30s display. I would definitely recommend this phone for everyone who wants to buy a budget best phone.

It's a real Monster in packet size, having a Monstrous Battery, Monstrous Display, Monstrous Memory option, Monstrous capable processor.... And most importantly its having lowest radiation (SAR) phone among it's competitors... That means Monstrous safety.... Great going Samsu.....😘 More over I have ordered 3 M30s from Amazon for my family members.. And everybody is having superb feedback.

Camera quality decent. Battery lasting as expected. Finger print sensor quality could be more better.
We may have to remove some unnecessary preloaded apps to improve phone performance, by doing this I have saved my ram occupancy by 1 GB.
Look is great however front camera flash not available. Only one speaker with stereo effect and the phone only supports Dolby digital sound in headsets. I have noticed a little heating problem. Display quality is good being super amo led employed in this phone. Gorilla glass could be provided at this price.

I have always been a bit skeptical towards Samsung products, but the specs and the pricing of this phone made me try it, and to my surprise, the phone has not disappointed (yet). The camera is amazing, food mode, AR emoji, night mode, everything. My most favourite feature of this phone though would be it's humongous battery, I went through an entire day of continuous camera use, Bluetooth earphones and watch and half day using WiFi for 1080p videos, and the battery barely passed the halfway mark by the end of the day. So far, not bad.

Loving the display quality. Highlights: 1.Has blue light filter options (useful when using at night especially) 2. Selfie mode has palm detection. After the front camera detects your face, show your palm and the camera clicks after countdown. 3. Brightness adjusts automatically. Overall the phone is classy.

Very very very beautiful and excellence smart phone of Samsung Galaxy m30s. It's fingerprint work fastly and it's camera quality of 48MP is awesome click. Camera quality is good as compared to M30. And battery life is so good like that a power bank. 6000mah battery output is very good. And sapphire blue color also awesome color.
Front camera should be increase but it's also good in this price.
Price is good for that feature provided.
Fingerprint reader very sensitive to read fingers line.

The main quality of this phone is its battery. If you are a hardcore mobile user for normal usage, this phone is the best. Portrait mode is excellent,  but normal camera during night is a bit disappointing ( can be fixed by an update  ) . Overall looks are awesome. Comfortable in hand. Can cause heating problems if you are a heavy gamer ( wouldn't recommend for hard core gamers ). Otherwise performance wise it's quite good. Overall a superb phone in the mid-range category. 😄

The delivery done by Amazon is amazingly fast. I ordered it on 28th September 2019 (before the official launch) and get on the same day.
The Camera quality is very good. Also the camera features are fabulous.
AMOLED screen of this mobile is much much beautiful than other mobiles.
The battery of 6000mah is the strength of this mobile.
But
The Mobile I got, I think it is damage or something, I don't know.
But overall I think the Mobile's performance is quite good.

In the advertisement it is said as Monster.yes it is a real monster as for the battery is considered. This is my sixth phone for me for the past ten years. I am very much satisfied with this monster. The selfie capture by
 waving hand is super and the camera quality is much more satisfactory.The audio and video  qualify is very much eqeul to very costly phones . The slow motion capture is excellent.. Overall this phones performance is much more then expectation and worth for the money.

Awesome phone by Samsung and far better than rival MI, Vivo and Oppo phones!
Selfie camera quality is really awesome and battery life is also awesome, Rear camera is also awesome and it gives beat shots in night as well.
Touch seems like a butter on the fingers, Best buy under that range,

Screen and battery is up to the mark.No any other phone compare it.Back camera is super but I am very very disappointed with its front camera. It is very poor. I am using Samsung a9 pro 2016 with 8 mp camera and I am surprised because it is more better then this Samsung M30s front 16 mp camera.Really it is very poor. I am very disappointed first time with Samsung.i want to request to solve this in next update.

Phone is decently good in battery life, finishing. Finger sensor and looks but not good in camera quality. low light image is too poor and not provide any different mode in camera, my samsung m10 camera and m30s camera looks similar....  as compare to my samsung S4 image quality of m30s is very much lacking and pixel distorted during zooming in image.... i didnt expect from samsung that deliver this type of quality in competetion

- Stunning Super Amoled Display
- Brilliant smooth rendering
- Dolby Atmos support for headsets.
- High frequency octa core processory.
- All of these at an extra affordable price point!!

Cons:
- Charging rate could be made a little more faster.
- More colour options would have been great.
- Unless you buy a case, this would elude from your hands quite easily.

Samsung thumps back in style!!

In love with this Samsung phone. Monster Battery is the most highlighting  factor. Camera not upto the mark as it boasts to be. Performance is good. The absence of gorilla glass is a thing to be worried with regard to its display. Overall good phone in this budget.

If there any redmi users dont buy this mobile,u will get greatly disappointed. Only good things about m30s is the display look and video taking quality..It doesn't show any sign of 6000 mah battery and 4 gm ram...really wasted on these parameters..The network is getting changed from 4g to 2g frequently even in town areas.Doesnt feel like 48 mp camera..they are just fooling costomers..finally the processor of Samsung m30s is utter slow.for a normal user can by this..otherwise u decide

The product is worth the price its offering. From an I-Phone user XS-Max 256GB (lost few months back) to a Samsung User, it is out of the box mobile phone. I can buy 4 Samsung phones at the price of one I-Phone. Features of Samsung phone is excellent. Speed, Short cut Keys, Camera, Battery life is just excellent, Transfer of files, USB Tethering for internet, Hot Spot for internet over WIFI, its a bunch of positive features for this master piece for Samsung. M30s is impressive and am sure future upgrade will definitely be a Samsung. Keep it up.

Phone is excellent and value for money as it is from Samsung brand much much better than any Chinese brand . Some are complaining about its built quality I tell you frankly there is no such type of issue with this phone, the only drawback of it is camera quality and I hope Samsung will solve this issue by its software update . Battery back is also more than good but not excellent and this can also be rectified by software update from Samsung  . Display is crisp and best , sound is awesome . You can choose this product without any 2nd thought.

I'm loving my new phone. Samsung Galaxy M30S is gorgeous in looks. I've ordered the white one. Battery life is amazing. Charges fast and lasts longer. If I charge it to 70%  in morning and watch web series all day I dont need to charge it until next morning. It has a great display, good camera quality and amazing sound quality with earphones on. Though I feel the speaker could have been a bit louder, but it can be ignored when you get all the other features at it's best!

It is an excellent mobile,  compact and versatile. Beautifully designed and sturdy. Its camera quality is above  par. Have used many mobiles, but this mobile camera quality  is excellent.  As also the battery with long life, one doesn't have to worry  about getting caught with low battery charge.  The  fingerprint reader works excellent.  Must say Samsung has improved  its products  with continued  R&amp;D which takes it far ahead of its competitors.  Wish Samsung God speed.

3. Touch is working fine.
4. "Fingerprint Reader" is perfect.
5. "Camera quality" is okay when compared to A30/M30.

It is one of the best battery backup phone not only in this segment but also higher price range segment.
It have exynos9611 processor which is very good to use comparatively from712 and other processor.
It have flash on front camera through amoled screen.
Back camera have 48 megapixel ,wide angle camera and night mode also does well.
Samsung super amoled screen is awesome. Really great visual experience.
It nailed in its segment ,so don't hesitate  to buy this gold

Samsung Galaxy M30s has tons of features worth mentioning. Firstly, the battery is 6000 mAh, which means that the battery lasts an entire day or maybe more. Secondly, it's camera is really clear and the RAM usage is also appreciable in that around 1 GB remains free even after installing 10-12 apps. The display to screen ratio is great, with awesome clarity. I am using the 4GB version and would recommend this phone to anyone looking to buy one with a budget below 15k.

I've been using The Samsung Galaxy M30S for about a week now and all I can say is that it is definitely worth considering if your looking for a new affordable device with a fantastic camera, humongous battery and great storage space!!
The only downfall to this great handset is that, samsung has not included a cover and screen guard in the box which, according to me are absolute immediate requirements.
Otherwise, this phone is worth every penny spent!!

PROS:
Nice phone , with superb features like All time on display,  supersteady  video combined with wide angle camera gives movie like video quality &amp; still photos too. Camera AI is amazing, Amoled display is very crisp and bright.
Night mode in camera is good and useful at times, so is slowmotion and super slowmotion. Dolby Atmos sound for earphones.
SOME CONS:
Plastic back body and no back silicone case provided in box, makes the phone slippery in hand at times..need to cautious.

Excellent. , user interference, look, hand grip, ui performance, battery life over all superb. Front camer little bit disappointing. Except i love this one.... Actually since 2014 i am using xiaomi branded smartphones &amp; still have 8 different models.... Before mi launched in india  i was the fan of samsung... Many reasons let me out from samsung after 10 years i decided to buy samsung M30s reading off all relevant information about phone. Finally i am right. in choosing the best phone in under 15k sigment i really won. My choice is extreem...

Right off the block, battery life is awesome. You can stream at least 4-5 hours of video and still leave room for talktime at the end of the day. Ease of use like any Android smartphone. A little heavy to carry but obviously because of huge battery. Camera would be 4/5 as its really not 48 MP but more like 32. From a Samsung I expected more. Overall a great phone in 13k bracket to be used for 3 yrs. Screen replacement warranty from Amazon is great and you need not worry @ that

Very poor camera...really 48mp...expected more, but it not upto good mark
Why Samsung mentioned 48mp publicly on specs...12mp also people can accept it right.

Suggestion: is there any chance develop update for improving camera performance..it's really big help for all Samsung Galaxy M30S customers

For normal usage with 4g on for full day( morning 8am to 8pm) 30% battery gets consumed. I use to do mormal surfing, social media, emails etc. Screen quality is superb, sometimes I do feel that screen doesnt respond at one touch. Charging time is almost 2 hour 30 min . To charge 50 % it takes one hour. Processor is good enough to do normal day to day task. Summary phone is good in this budget. If you have more than 15k go for realme xt.

Awesome, really worth. Its camera quality was nice and the superslow motion was just amazing. It has good battery. It would have been better if they had included earphone with the set. The fingerprint reader is quick so we can open it fast. But sometimes the other person cannot hear what is being said in call, so I am assuming the mike is not very good. Phone is a little bit heavier than what is comfortable.

Frankly speaking I was thinking a lot before purchasing this product. I dont have good impression on samsung android. But somehow managed and procured.

Really a awesome product. Excellent battery, looks great. Camera is perfect with flash and without flash it's just good. Many options are available like always on display, auto collage of photos, etc..

Really a awesome mobile to buy and I have recommended to my friends too..

Wonderful mobile with outstanding display, very good battery life, fast processor, clear sound, nice looks, easy to hold and that too on very reasonable price and Samsung tag. I have been using this phone since one week and haven't faced any problem till date. I would highly recommend this phone. Touch screen is just like butter. This phone beats my previous phone Xiaomi redmi note 7 pro in all aspects. Best mobile in this price range. Don't even think before buying this one because it's the best u can get.

Samsung M30S is the best phone. It has Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with screen size of 6.4 inches. You have to pay Rs13999 but you will get back Rs1000 in your Amazon pay wallet. So effectively it is for 13K and that also can be converted into EMI with no interest as when you opt for EMI then they reduces the Interest amount from the billed amount.
It is best phone in this price range.
It has 6000MAH battery with quick charging.
Camera 48mega pixel.
Screen size 6.4 inches
Storage 64GB

Excellent battery life only, disappointed with quality of 40 mega pixel camera after a little zoom picture blurred. I have another mobile brand nokia it's 8mp camera is better than samsung 40mp. I think I spend money only for battery 🤔

Pros:
1.Lovely display
2.Monster Battery
3.Handy design
4.Decent software
5.Always on display option

Cons:
1.Slow camera while on focus
2.Below average picture clarity(Not an expected one)
3.Average built quality
4. No gorilla glass protection as informed (Better to buy tempered glass and back panel)

Conclusion:
Better performance for this price range. We can buy if we find some good deals :)

The worst part of the phone is the fingerprint sensor placement and the Samsung UI which can be solved by third party launchers like Nova though.
Now, good parts are the battery and overall performance which is good for an average user who is not into gaming.

The mobile is good according to budget.I got this at rupees 15300 with sbi debit card &amp; also got 1000 rupees cashback as Amazon Pay balance.
Battery life is awesome,front camera quality is  quite good but rear camer could be much better as it is 48mp.
Super amolled display is also very good.
But there should be some more features like internet speed meter,auto call recorder,AI beauty mode in camera.
I have faced some network issues while surfing internet. It's not that good.Hence I gave 4 star.
Samsung need to update these.

Just buy the phone! It has everything a person needs who is constantly addicted to his/her phone. sAmoled screen makes it a delight to watch YouTube videos. I am not a heavy gamer but played asphalt 8 on this one and the game play was as if playing on a premium handset.

I am yet to find a con in this one but pros list is healthy.

Camera: 8.5/10
Battery: 10/10
Processor: 10/10
Screen: 10/10

Need another tips?

I you are searching for a good budget phone, I will surely recommend you m30s. It has great features for a fair price. The camera is good. But if you are looking for only a camera phone you can go for Xiaomi or Realme XT.
It has great performance and the screen is absolutely amazing. The fingerprint sensor is an 8.5/10 types,but still its ok. Battery is excellent. Easily stays up for a day.

Overall looking at the price,performance, battery and camera I would give this phone 9/10.

Recieved this coolest product from Samsung through Amazon, trust me life has become more classy and it gives a very good vibe while using this phone, Trust me the features are really good and the camera is awesome,  the display is too smooth and very efficient. The power element in this M30S is its Battery capacity and the fast charging, which Samsung has provided in this budget phone.
Really Happy while using it.
Thank you Samsung and Amazon ❤❤

The phone promises all that is said about it. Needs charging once is 2/3 days. Functions very well. Camera quality is excellent with panoramic , night photography , slow motion etc and good functions for post processing.
I purchased a 64 GB capacity am very happy with finish and functioning of the phone

Also it has a full hd + amoled display which is very good.the build quality could have been better by giving the phone a frame.
The fingerprint  scanner  was good not the best also there is a small deflection  towards inside when u press on the fingerprint  scanner like u always feel it's broken
Other wise the product is very good

I am using this phone from last one month. Excellent features. Look and feel is good. Now I can listen the audio and video songs continuously without any fear of battery. Fast charging. Great battery backup, am getting almost close to 2-3 days. No need to carry charger like other phones. Image display is awesome. Processor is fast as I am attending the office meetings on phone webex. Am very much impressed with all in one features with affordable price.

signal reception is dumb, camera quality is fake as mentioned, 7I Chinese are performing better ,if Samsung goes like this with out improving they may drop from 2nd to 5th shortly and forgot to mention the ui isn't user friendly do some thing immediately regarding signal reception other wise no one will buy Samsung phone

It's  ~ 5 Weeks since Am using this phone  ...
Delivery by Amazon was Prompt,  as usual..
All the features  are As mentioned  ..
6000mah Battery is Awesome..
So is Display ..
So far So good , me feels , Camera needs to be improved..  ..
Humble Suggestion : Samsung should make, Gorilla Glass Protection .. A default inbuilt option.  To all its mobiles ..

Cons :-
No Gorilla glass protection..
Back panel is too smooth for one's comfort

I bought it on the 1st if October, 2019.

Battery life is awesome. Screen is awesome. Slightly bigger than my earlier phone the Mi Redmi4.

The sound has been constantly deteriorating and now the earpiece is dead. I cant hear a word now.
Major touch screen issues.
Major Major network issues
Network issue with WA video calling.

It's just 2 months old and I am already in for service/replacement.

I feel that Xiaomi and Motorola makes better quality and sturdier phones.
-----

This phone is not for power users or gamers because this phone hangs a lot even with 4-5 basic apps running in the background.

The earpiece quality and camera and battery backup and amoled screen are this phones plus points.

First thing first, the battery on this device is byfar one of the best i have seen in any smart phone. Add to it the beautiful Amoled display which not only looks good but further helps the device to conserve more battery. The UI is easy to use. The back panel looks nice. I have the blue colour. It gives a dual tone in sunlight. The phone is fast. Calls and network is good. No issues faces till now. The camera output is good.

Pros
Battery life is excellent can run 24 hours with ease with no battery saver as well
Screen is upto the mark, does not feel a budget phone when you look at the phone
Samsung interface is better, does not lag

Cons
The build quality does not look so premium as it appears in the images (plastic finish could be of better quality giving it more premium feeling), camera quality is also poor considering the specification we have in the phone (need an urgent software update for the same)

What I liked?

The Samsung Galaxy M30s has a Super AMOLED display
Samsung's Exynos 9611 SoC is powerful to handle multitasking
The 6,000mAh battery helps phone to survive for 2 day
Ultra Wide mode in camera is best.

What I dislike?
Camera performance in night mode us not up to the expectations
Battery takes  too long to charge
No Headphones or Backcover in the Box

Overall Best Budget Phone..!

The phone is superb. excellent look, shiny body, camera excellent results.
Used it since its launch. excellent battery backup. Fast Charging is excellent.  used heavily with lots and lots of app, no hanging problem.

But no cover,  no screen guard, no headphone provided,

overall the phone is worth buying experience. Samsung is SAMSUNG. no complaints.

It's a amazing product from Samsung. I just love it. It battery life is incredible and camera quality is also awesome.
Fingerprint reader also have a very less response time. But one thing doesn't meet to my expectations that is the charger, with an incredible 6000 mAh battery Samsung must have provided atleast a 18 W fast charger. But even though it's other features leke it's processor, oh sorry a incredible processor outshine everything.

This is one of the best Samsung phone in lowest price I use this phone from 1 month. The phone features is so nice and amazing. You can't believe 6000 mah in battery so helpful for tour. This phone's camera quality is so beautiful just think 48 mp rear camera with 8mp and 5 mp  another side 16 mp selfie camera is not so better network faculty not so good Bixby home is not available fingure print is not in screen but another features are totally nice so I want say please buy this phone if you have lowest prices

A total masterpiece from Samsung.

The photo quality is awesome. With 48 megapixel.
And the clarity in wide angle shot is also good.
All the photos taken via camera, had indepth picture clarity.

Next the battery life, I was able to use my samsung m30s mobil for a complete 2 days , without putting  the Mobil in charge. This was just normal usage such as WhatsApp and few videos.

Samsung m30s has this feature of shake free video,  you run you walk with video mode on,
You will be amazed.

dont buy mobile from Amazon
this product is pathetic
camara quality sucks
i bought this today and i want to replace the phone with some different brand and amazon person is saying you cant replace the product

Amazon is planning a trap and they are robing your money in technical term
Samsung and Amazon both are robers
i just want to replace the product with diff brand or give my money back
i am going to exclate this to very high level
i want my money back you robers

The phone has all the features that I required..Colour awesome ..battery life much better than other phone...Finger print is good..Back camera is the best and photo quality is good but selfie camara can be much better ..One thing I like to mention is security features are better than any other phone in the segment ..Over all its a phone that I like to give 5.5 star 👍if I can but I ll give only 5 star coz of selfie camera(it mean it is better but not so good as I was expecting) that's y 5 star not extra .5👍👌👌👌☺️☺️☺️

Good battery life... Easily can offer 12 hours of screen usage..for me it takes 2 days to drain off the battery.
Camera quality is very good.

Just finger print sensor is not very smooth.. Like it takes little more time in comparison to my previous Motorola phone but overall is good

Extremely slow to operate...sometimes hangs too. When one has to navigate from one app to another and press the home button, this phone just hangs a lot and takes 5-10secs to move between apps which makes a quick navigation almost impossible. Camera also hangs and does not capture the photos fast especially when you are moving in car or train at high speeds and makes the pictures blurr....overall not satisfied and very disappointing experience after purchasing this phone last year near Diwali.

Good product and value for money but not a great product. Camera quality is very good but doesn’t look like a 48MP one.
Battery life is good but I don’t see considerable back up when compared with my Samsung Galaxy A8+ which is of 3500mAh.

This the best mid budget segment phone launched by Samsung till date. I am highly impressed with the performance of the device.  One UI is amazing.
Definitely the camera could have been better.  But overall the device is amazing and a must buy in this price range.
Battery is long lasting up to a backup of 2.5days on normal usage. Always on display is like cherry on cake.
Samsung is known for its s amoled panels and in this device also the display is amazingly impressive. I love it.

This is my first Samsung smartphone and I love it.

Honest review after 1 day use
I got it for 11600/- for this price range we cann’t expect more than this here the plus points are fabulous display,sound normal, killing design
Minus points are Samsung given fake specifications they didn’t gave 14W charger it’s getting more than 2and half hours ,6000mh battry feels like 4000mh ,48 mp camera feels like 8 mp ,dolby atmos not feels great ,back panel comes with plastic it feels ceep looking
Finally Samsung gives fake specifications but for 11600/- its worthble if u are movies lover go for this

Writing this review aftr 3 months of use.
This is a very good phone if you are lookining for something this budget.
Battery last for 2 days with normal usage and 1.5 day with heavy use.
Camera quality is very good along with some extra features in it.
Technical specs you may see in product details but let me tell you that this phone performs up to the mark. Processor is good. No lagging till now.
So from my opinion. If this phone fits in your budget then go for it.

I had to buy 2 sets, first one had to be replaced. Back cover was making sound and hence returned the same. Also the set was taking around 3 hours to get charged even on switched off mode. It hardly lasted only till 1.5 days. :(
The second set was pathetic, it had creaking sound and non-fit feel all around its cover and the screen would automatically switch on even without touching the power button but over touch or press at any place. I had to return it. My time and effort was wasted by Samsung. Very much unbecoming of Samsung.

After almost 5 years, I have bought a Samsung phone. With this price the configuration is too good to believe. The camera is a masterpiece and so is the display. The battery runs for almost 2 days.

When we are on a call, the one's on the receiving end are not able to hear my voice properly (very low volume).
I had to speak loudly for them to hear.
Is this a problem with Samsung phones??
I have used other brand phones before (none of them had this kind of issue).
If any one knows a fix, do comment.

I have bought this phone recently, and here I am sharing my experience of using this phone.
1.Battery life - Battery life is awesome and completely justify 6000 mAH although it takes time to get completely charge.
2. Camera - Rear camera is good even in low lights. But front camera is not so good in dark.
3. No heating problem yet.
4. Sound quality is superb.
5. Phone is quite slippery.
Overall I want to say phone is good in this range.(paisa-wasool chiz h boss.)

Processor is not that great...its giving lags when we try to open multiple apps or when we use high graphic apps ...so this phone is NOT for GAMERS....
The battery life is not as expected , feels like a normal phone battery...
And the camera quality is ok ok....
But at this budget its a great phone..so we can think of buying it.
This review is given after hours of testing..Thakyou!

A really good phone for the price. The battery life is awesome. If the device is at a 100% charge, you could play a game like COD for hours before you need to charge the device again. The camera is good. I'm not really a person who would use camera extensively, so I won't go into it. Samsung's default launcher is not my cup of tea. So I've had to use CPL which gives me the stock Google experience. The device runs really well. And the display is good for the price range. Overall, the device is worth the bucks I spent.

Camera  very good quality clarity and multi focus is excellent  little disappointed with video but more or less happy.
Battery  lasts almost two full day with internet  finger print sensor quite efficient  if mobile switched off or restart mode first time needs to use manual password use I think this is command with all mobiles.

Overall quite satisfied and on my recommendation  10 people have purchased this model  Great  thanks to SAMSUNG AND AMAZON

But Camera quality is not good it's normal but not bad in this price range
Fingerprint reader is working very well but face unlock is very bad.. It's unlock my phone when I'm sleeping so please don't use face unlock for security..
Battery life and fast charging both are very good..
I'm unsatisfied to Samsung because Samsung Not  give any cover to secure my smartphone because after some day I saw that my phone backside have some scratches...

Every aspect of this phone is superb.Battery lasts for 2 1/2 days.Charges very fast. Quality of sounds- adjustable are fantastic.Clarity of sound is lovely. Images are crystal clear. Camera is excellent.
  For the price of the phone, the benefits we reap are more than expected.
I also bought a leather wallet case which has been obviously specially designed to suit this phone and is very good and fits well with provision of space for Business card, credit cards etc.

Battery Life: I am using this phone with Dual sim &amp; getting good battery life of around one &amp; half day.
Camera quality: Taking a natural photos but i think still needs some improvement in Camera quality.
Fingerprint reader: works properly only in some cases it will not recognize the fingerprint.

Overall good phone with Super AMLOED display which i like most. I hope good performance of phone will continue for longer time.

Bought this amazing phone few days Back. fingerprint reader feature works really great for me. Its instant and fast unlock.  48 MP camera quality Is best in this Category I would say.
And the best in the Lot is battery life. My screentime is very high. Plus I make atleast 50 to 100 calls a day. Browsing I do around 3 to 4 hours a day. For my kind of heavy usage work it lasts a day which is really helpful to me..

Screen quality is really Impressive.

This phone punches above its weight..
Great phone under 14000.

Samsung m 30s  mobile features and usage of this mobile is too good.  Long time using this mobile.making me more smother in useage of apps and good camera quality. Defined camera with multiple features with in it. Love the wide angle and slow motion recordings. Heay storage and incredible storage space. Untill never had a thought other brands.  Suggested my friends to take Samsung M30s.  Unique features... smooth going and battery life good .

Phone is Ok but  Camera quality is very bad, It's like 5 MP camera and speaker volume is very low and even not having clarity in speakers. Want to return my set after use using some hours. But Amazon refused. They check the phone online app system and say set is ok. very dis-pointed with this type of service from amazon, never expected.

Average phone.
Camera quality of all android phones in this era very very poor.
48 mega pixel quality is comparable with 3.2 megapixel of Nokia n73.

I feel average after initial few hrs of use. May be I have higher expectations.  Just another phone with high claims. Yet to see it deliver on the battery part. But it did go down quickly on day one. Now day 3, and charge ran for a full 1.5 days. So far so good.

Really a good phone to have.
Pros:
1. 6000 mah battery and that too from Samsung is the best thing you could have for your phone.
2. 48+8+5 MP camera is a worth buy at this price.
3. Exynoz 9611 is a good processor at this range.
Cons:
1. The processor is kind of battery consuming so you would be getting battery around 5700 mah.
Other than that it's a best purchase.

You cannot simply get a phone with 128GB space, 6GB memory , 48 megapixel camera and 6000Mah battery in such an affordable price. The battery life of phone is amazing. Camera is superb. Has all the latest features.
Samsung hardware is an added advantage.
Simply go for it. Battery life and camera is USP of this phone.

Cant find anything exceptional in this 48 mp camera.neither the night mode is good.battery backup is good.despite 6 gb ram it feels like 3gb phone.i think thats due to exynos chip.snapdragon  would be better to go i think.rest all is good but overpriced overall as per performance

According to me its just a great phone with a huge battery capacity of 6000mAh. The battery standalone time is also good. Regarding the rear and front camera I was expecting something more better but still its good in this price range.
Fingerprint reader response time is a little bit  slow as compared to other devices i used, But in regarding with gaming experience and weight wise M30s stands on top for me.
Thanks

Camera quality is superb, even in low light, the pictures have ambient exposure.
Battery backup is monstrous. Can go for 2-3 days without charging, if you are a moderate user.
The screen feels premium due to the super AMOLED display.
Combination of black with green contrast was very good.
Overall the phone is good and can be purchased without hesitation.
Price offering by amazon and Samsung was also very reasonable, considering the bank and wallet offers :)

Buying this phone was the best decision made. Best Buy at sub 15 k price bracket. 6000mAh battery with fast charging is best coupled with Super Amoled display. touch sensitivity is awesome and video viewing is a pleasure. Camera is excellent in outdoor sun light. Indoor performance has to be tweaked with software update.

Screen 5 star
Batter 5 star
Performance 5 star
Camera 4 star (only due to indoor artificial lighting)

Display is epic
Excellent battery
Camera is decent
Back panel has issues u  can hear click sounds if u press at certain spots which is annoying, a back cover might solve this
Auto brightness feature takes time to adjust as it doesn't have a light sensor it uses the front camera.

Battery life is good, phone weight is well distributed,  but after putting  a case it becomes heavy. Screen quality is great.I got the 6GB ram variant, it's great for gaming  and streaming HD content 🙂

I used Mi phone earlier , which had heating  issue and high SAR(radiation), so now switched to Samsung.

The best feature of this phone is that it is a battery.  I am traveling, so I have to travel more than 4 days a week.  Therefore, I need a good battery back phone, which is designed for me.  For me and those who are traveling.  My data connection lasts most of the time.  Then by 8:00 pm my phone's battery % is 50%.The back camera of phone is amazing, but the samsung needs to work on the selfie camera.I think the phone is value for money.But samsung is not providing any screen protector or ear phone.

A true market leader product by samsung for a medium class budget segment with premium class feelings.
Camera quality is way better than its other market player.
Fingerprint reader is very accurate.
Battery life was a major concern for samsung in android phones as compared to its guru model but this time samsung comes with a game changer...A lot of thanks samsung.

Using Samsung for the first time
The most adorable thing about Samsung m30s is its display
6000 mah battery is not up to the mark
My asus zenfone max with 5000 mah battery gives more usage time than m30s 6000 mah battery
Camera is fine but did not meet the expectations
Device is getting heated while playing pubg.

Really happy to buy Samsung product for the 1st time... Really missed Samsung features for so many years...Excellent battery, very good Finger print lock, very good camera, excellent sensitivity, user friendly &amp; value for money.  I feel that Samsung M30s is launched for me as I was looking for a value for money smartphone  with all the required features which I think this phone is having and therefore I am really appreciating this phone. If you are looking for a smart choice and value foe money, then go for Samsung M30s 6GB variant.

Very disappointed by the product, the product can't load older images in any other app like instagram, Facebook from the gallery. Camera resolution is very bad compared to 48megapixcels, the body got scratched up in the use of 1 month, apps like Facebook, instagram, snapchat crashes now and then. I guess I should have gone for mi a3 rather than this phone. This phone is not worth buying.

-sAMOLED screen is way better than a normal led screen.
-Nice body to screen ratio.
-48 megapixels and telephoto camera mode are good.
-Face unlock is quite responsive.
-We get lot of features in settings
Cons
-Fingerprint scanner is little bit slow(it takes a moment to unlock)

-Slow motion is fun to use but works good only in bright light.
-The Interface is not very smooth.

I have purchased this phone after lots of research. Camera, battery, connectivity, design, OS comparison to other phone like realms, Nokia, redmi, Vivo, oppo ....this is the best on them. I used all day without charging. I have used this in low light ...no issue in picture quality. Display quality is also good for watching amazon prime video

I have been using the m30s for the past 3 weeks now. The phone is really good and at this price and especially the price I bought it for, it's more than a steal. The display is excellent as expected by a samsung phone. I have the 4GB ram but there are no legs as such and the animations are all snappy. The camera is again excellent with lot of customizations one could do. The battery life is solid so far. Overall a remarkable phone at this price range

Good, close to ideal. The camera is lethargic after some months of usage. Specifically, for beauty mode. The camera struggles a lot.
But I have more than 120 apps in my phone and still, a 4gb is killing it.

So issues except the camera speed.

At this price tag samsung has not offered front flash...i came to know about this today as i was kliking picture in a dark room n got surprised knowing this fact...so thought to write review.
Overall phone is very good.
Nice battery performance,camera,music...color.
But at last it is a utter disappointment not having front flash.
So i request buyers to look for other brands too at this price tag before going for samsung m30s for the front flash feature

Battery back was really so good. Once i filled battery to 100% it came around 47 hours to me by utilising all applications games, movies, etc...

No words to explain about camera performance really wonderful...

Screen size as expected it was good

Processor speed it was like super fast express...

Overall mobile performance was excellent and very very much worthy for the money you are spending

No Doubt ... this is one of the best smartphone out there at this price range. The exceptionally long battery life... I mean its 6000 mAh .... lasts almost 11 hr nonstop (Social media , Movies etc. ). I am an average PUBG player ... but most of the time I can't complete the whole gamming session with my friends because their battery doesn't lasts more than 4 hrs. Camera is absolutely amazing.. what a bright colors.... and the amoled screen is OMG !! Just wow.. great contrast and brightness. Totally worth the money.

I like the design. Finger print scanner is fast but not the faster. Rear camera quality is very good but the front camera gives smooth images. It is not sharp enough and gives less details. Battery lasts for a day in normal use. I think a 6000 mah should give little more. Overall it is a better choice for who is seeking a mid range phone. My last update affect the speed of fingerprint sensor in a bad way. Also the battery is draining faster after update.Even expect  further improvements in software updates. And I love the phone

You should give back cover also with phone
Samsung should add more latest features
Phone is ok but we compare the phone with redmi note 8 pro redmi have good features samsung require more latest features
Otherwise phone is ok
Battery back up is good 6000 mah
Camera quality is also good
Samsung require to add more features like dual messenger for all apps, app locks and download speed in notification bar also panaroma for front camera
Sometime phone is hang

I have been using this mobile more than a week... it's quite excellent in performance tried more than 5 ,6 apps at a time without any lags..
AMOLED Display gives awesome clarity..( especially 4k videos) .
BATTERY life is really a monster  it's been 2.5days since it charged fully and have consumed only 75% battery (With nearly 2hrs gaming,2 movies,moderate socialnetwork apps).
Camera wise it was good in day light.. night mode and indoor shots where not as much to the expectation.
Video recording in 4k is pretty cool.

Camera quality is pretty bad. It even fails Amazon blancco app test. Amazon promises a replacement but they are delaying it till now, without attempting delivery they update as delivery failed. Poor service. Another thing worth mentioning is the bad build quality of the phone. Anywhere you press it gives a click sound.

They returned me on the same day and said that they have updated the latest software and claimed that it will work fine but still my phone is getting switched off automatically anytime.

I am disappointed by the product😞😞

If there is any way I can fix this problem. Please comment.Samsung, if You are seeing this ,please help.

I am loving it. The best value for money, that's what you can expect when you purchase Samsung Galaxy M30s. Till now I was using Redmi Note 6 pro and I purchased  this for my family. But after having the experience  I retained  it with me and gave Redmi phone to family.
The phone comes with 6000 mAh battery which in normal case runs for 2 days. Picture quality  is also very good. Touch screen as well as fingerprint sensors are excellent.
Overall the best phone for this price.

Cheap. Build quality is far below Samsung's standards. Only thing that separates this m series from Chinese manufacturers phones is radiation level, if what they say is true.
How does that "48mp camera" fare? Godawful.

Also, A50, 9610 exynos has LTE+ support, why doesn't 9611? (might've fixed in later updates, or it simply doesn't show despite having it, idk)

Great battery, sAMOLED, supposedly decent processor does somewhat to makeup for the compromise I suppose..

I ordered my m30s 6gb/128 gb on 16th October and got it next day.after using one week i am very happy with its performance. Its very economical with its features .my main reasons to buy this mobile its battery n its quite good.screen is very good,camera with so many features its fine but its not for highly camera lover.look and mobile feel is very good.only two draw back of this mobile is frist its small data cable.second
For charging its take quite long so fast charger is better option for its big battery.

This phone has an exceptionally good battery life. The amoled screen is totally recommended. It packs in a very fast processor and a very fast fingerprint sensor. The charger which came out with the box is too good. I would recommend this phone for all people who are looking for a good battery back up.
In this price range its a nice phone.

The most striking feature of the phone is its appearance. The Amoled glass gives a different dimension to the device altogether. Definitely worth the money. Comes with the latest version of Android and remarkable touch sensitivity. Monster battery life as featured in the description of the phone. It can go without charging for upto 2 days. The front camera however, poses some glitches which can be improved upon. Overall, very satisfactory.

Speech is not audible, I have to use loud speaker whenever  I make or receive a call.  Touch screen is not functioning most of the time , I have to tap the screen repeatedly. The phone goes in hang up mode and often has to restarted. Downloaded music stops abruptly and has to be restarted very often. High ly disappointed with the performance of the phone. At present I am out of station and will be back at Noida( my residence) end Feb, 2020 then I will show it to the authorised repairer.

In this price point, these features are just awesome. I have been using the phone past last 48 hours with single charge. The battery is seriously a beast. The camera looks promising in moderate day light conditions, the night mode will be set to test during Diwali. Fingerprint is pretty good. The look and feel is of a high end device. Just one Cons is crippling sound, when we tightly press the vertical faces /edges of the device. Rest be assured, it's the best one can get in this price.

Very Very bad. Never purchase this phone. I bought this phone 5 months ago and after 2 months battery charging issue start coming in this phone and when I checked with Samsung service centre they told me same thing twice that 2 times it was software problem and after 1 month same problem in this phone.
It is in warranty period and still I faced this issue thrice and spending my precious Time and money on conveynce but what after warranty expires then they will ask me extra money for software update as well.

Never thought Samsung wil produce such a worst phone. Camera quality is very poor. Its not worth.  processing is slow.  Internet speed is very slow. Network catching is very low. Signal catching power very very poor. Camera quality is not of 48MP. Just for name sake they say camera quality 48MP. But camera is not good. Have issue with speed. Lot if issue with internet speed. Speed is very very low. It doesnt look like 6gb Ram.

Pros:
1. Excellent battery

4. 4gb is equallent to 6gb speed of other mobiles. It's fast.
5. Worth for people who move around frequently.
Cons:
1. Face unlock is slow.
2. Often clear catche to keep space free.

Overall 4.6star.

Hi, Galaxy M30s was most awaited mid segment mobile. Having waited for the launch as Amazon Special was indeed Special for Camera quality as it captures amazing pics with its 48 mega pixels - Attached pic is testimony for sharpness of shots  Battery life of mobile sails thru for 2 days with continuous usage which opens up by instant Fingerprint reader. I m proud to part of the current largest selling Samsung mobile.

Camera: Need improvements from low light perspective.
Battery: Although 6000mAh, with moderate internet usage the battery discharges relatively faster in 24 hours. With light usage including light internet usage it lasts for 2-3 days.
Fingerprint reader is very fast.
I expected tamper proof glass on the screen. But I had to buy it. Same with earphones. Please add these in the accessories.

Phone was good in this price but  little heating problems and the 48 megapixel camera is not good sa compared to others devices ,Samsung a50 capture better photos than this which is 25 megapixel  but I  switched to m30s due to its massive 6000 mah battery which is surprisingly awesome

The camera is not worth 48Mp, quality is good as per the price but you can clearly see the difference between a flagship level 48Mp camera and this camera. While gaming performance is good for the price range and you can see for it if battery is your main purpose. The overall performance is great and you can see for it. Hope it helps.

Great display at its price.
Astounding battery backup
Next level game performance (9611exynos similar to 730g)
*Heats up a bit (not a major also regular issue at this price)
*Built quality is avg(sim tray plastic made so is fragile)
*Camera is avg with respect to its competitors
Finally Worth its price.best overall smartphone.UI has been improved from its grandfathers(impressed)... finally Samsung is back with a budget bang

Expected more from camera but it's ok. Battery life is good. As said the phone doesn't heat up much, initial charging cycles it does but then it doesn't.

Many a times it restarts Os stability is in question.

Experience is just above average, but at this cost what do you expect

Waiting  for midrange phones from Samsung  like m30s. This phone is superb. Nice 48mp camera. Fast fingerprint  censor. &amp; Superb battery backup. I normally use 16 hrs. of a day. I play games, watch movies, YouTube  videos. My phone is always connected with wifi. But when I go to bed there is still 20-25 % charge left. Display quality  is also nice. &amp; last but not least, Samsung's some new features in their UI, which is something great. But one thing I want to add, the first charging should have been more faster.

Overall built quality is good.
Battery life really good.
Front camera is not upto the mark produces very soft images, lacking sharpness.
48 mp mode is producing only 12 mb pics.
Screen quality is good but have to be careful, one drop and you will loose your screen.
Fingerprint sensor reponces a littel bit slow but it is working fine. Worth for buying it for 11000 rupees.

King of budget phones, no one can compete samsung m30s at this price range, Everything in the phone is good but the night mode of camera lacks a bit and fingerprint is bit slow, well this is not at all a problem, this kind of camera and bit slow fingerprint scanner is totally acceptable at this price range, Thankyou samsung and Amazon you guys completely changed my choice from real me 5pro to Samsung m30s within a minute with those amazing cashbacks and instant discount, Worth to wait,
Thanks and Regards

I love the Samsung Galaxy M30s. The sleek lovely design is just awesome. The vibrant sapphire blue colour makes it much more attention grabbing. I love the power of the piece. Whether it be watching movies, playing games, it's a wonderful companion. I was initially a bit disappointed with camera, it was not clear as a camera of same mega pixels from one of the competitors. However it is worthwhile for the other options including super slow-mo. It gives a superb scope capture some beautiful things in and around.

I used the M30.  Very satisfied.  There is a similar Chinese company mobile, but Korean company products are much better in quality and durability.  When the M30S came out, I bought two.  One will present.  The M3 lineup is a blessing to India.

I have bought Samsung M30s on Feb 1st 2020. This phone exactly matches what I am looking for. First of all the camera quality is awesome and the amoled display is simply superb. Finger print sensor, Battery life, I am getting two days damn battery life, I am happy about this. 6GB and 128GB combination is giving speed as well as so many apps for me to store. Phone is an ultra slim figure with all the best features at budget. Overall 5 out of 5 from me. I will Suggest one to go for M30s.

This is the best pickup for a middle budget smartphone, battery is awesome, infinite u display gives you a better experience,  inbuilt Dolby atmos is good, cameras can be more effective as per mentioned in the features ,exynos processor is not comparable with snapdragon but for daily use it is good, liked the idea game booster in this phone ......finally I could have given 5stars but built quality is somehow not satisfied that was the drawback I noticed but overall it is the best for daily usage........

I bought this phone mainly because of battery  capacity. Normal operation is same as other phones in this price range. Few things I will mention which could have been better
- fingerprint scanner does not work properly
- while searching names in contacts recent should come first
- changing may be faster
- screen length may be little shorter
- few apps crashing in this phone which I have not seen in other phones

Mobile phone is too good. Camera clarity is awesome, it has different modes.. The battery life also nice.  After full charging, nearly 5-6 hours it stays even if you use continuously. The sound is clearly audible while listening songs using earphones. The display is awesome.. it feels like watching in a TV. Less expensive with more features. Face recognition feature is perfect as it won't unlock unless you show your face in a correct way.  This is the best phone to go for below 20K. Best product from Samsung.

Monster battery..
Camera not good at low light..
 Front camera quality is not so good in this price segment..
After two month use didn't notice any lagging..
Fingerprint sensor sometimes performs very bad..
Face unlock is lil bit slow compared to redmii or other device..
For a full day use i would suggest m30s the beast..
Use proper screenguard.. repairing cost of M30s display cost around 8000 INR..
Perfect for travellers.. and long time users..

I am not a net savvy rather a net meniac so eyeing for a sumptuous battery above all. To my utter annoyance this 6000 mah battery is only a bit better to its next kin M30 with 5000 mah. I might be expecting more. Camera quality is good but not with the conformity to a 48 mp one. Fingerprint reader is a bit sluggish. 6/128 gb ram/rom is excellent. An overall good product to buy in this price tag. Anybody may go for it that no other product can match these features that loaded in this phone. I might be more demanding than anyone else.

**My Pros**
Very good phone interms of Display, battery backup and user interface experience
Lowest radiation of Head SAR value.
**Cons**
 camera is just above average many times it prefers to take in 12mp instead of 48mp, next con is charging time it takes almost 3hrs of time to full charge, my last con is sound loudness in earphones, I've tested with many earphones and headphones but output is not that louder.
Final verdict very good value buy bcoz no is all are perfect.

Don't believe in fake reviews.

Excellent mobile phone I have ever purchased. Great Camera,  Awesome  battery life (2 days in case of my usage), It's been two weeks I am using it without any issues. No heating problems while changing. I have not feel any phone struck. Finally it's a great budget phone from Samsung.

I was socked when I have seen battery life of this phone. The phone's battery life is awesome. If you are business man and don't have time to charge your phone again and again then this is best phone for you which you can buy and use for 24 hours with a single charge

I got this phone for my mum as a replacement for her old phone. Just on the third day the phone just switched off and is not powering on. Called up Amazon customer care who asked me to do certain procedures, tried doing what was asked of me, but no sign off phone starting. I have an appointment booked for the technician to have a look at the phone so that a replacement can be arranged and this only next week. Samsung need to look at the quality of their products, really disappointing

4. Battery life is excellent almost 2 days on one single charge.
5. Processor good no lagging till now.
6. Touch is very good.

Cons

Overall in comparision to any other mob in this range, this is best. I got it 4gb variant for 11600/- and seriously not expecting this much from Samsung as my past experience is not good with Samsung.

Finger print sensor is not promt, one have to place full finger to unlock the phone. Infact finger
print reader space is too narrow. However face unlocking is superb and very much prompt. Battery and display is superb. Camera is good. However wide angel camera quality in low light is not much good. No specification about the material of display glass. Some reviews says it is prone to scratch.

I recently purchased this phone (1week) after deliberating for a little while - given the many choices that are available now. Finally I zeroed in on this phone to fit my budget, performance and longevity expectations. I must say that I have been thoroughly impressed by all the features - weight included, which is not much given this phone is carrying 6000mAH battery. A great buy and one which I feel is value for money. The phone has matched, if not exceeded, all my expectations.

Great phone with great battery life.
15W charger seems to be slower for this bigger battery
Wish they gave a longer charging cable.
Camera is decent for its price bad during night time.
For this price I guess you will be happy and those who wants a camera centric phone will not like this soo much.
But those who wants to use it to travel and watch videos and surf the internet and occasionally play games its good to go.

Best budget phone available in the market.
The phone works awesome does not lag and the battery backup is good.once full charged can be used for 2 days in my case it lasted around 1.5 days with around 30% still remaining i used YouTube, Amazon prime and general usage The battery charges fast.i think the camera quality is not up to the mark.except camera quality the phone is extraordinary.forgot to mention the display is just amazing with amoled display.

Every this is fine except Camera. If ur looking for display then ur in the right place. Samsung is named for its display.  sAmoled is superb.
Pros:
Display
Touch
Rich look
Back camera
Cons:
Camera - My old Redmi note 4 camera is much better than this. At the same time in terms of display Samsung is better.

Good phone under 20k and would be 5 star with a gorilla glass 5 and 6.5 inch option.

With tech moving up and s9 and such not a big difference, most of them present phones is going to only get cheaper.

Now I charge my phone, 3 days once. ;)

Hi frnds... after 5 days iam using
Monster in battery, 👍display👍👍...but not a camera😢😥👎👎, sound👎👎👎...
Overall...after exchange my redmi 3s prime...9400 is a big deal of me😊..
Finally....if u want best camera...go for sony sensors based mobiles like redmi note 7 pro, realme 5 pro..vivo z1x...

But if u want best battery, display go for it...it's superb....
Anybody want to hide videos ...👎no option in this mobile...go to redmi brand...

It's an astounding device as far as the price range goes. I've been using it for a few days now, and it works like a charm. A sAMOLED screen with fast charging and a monstrosity of a 6000maH battery capacity with a chipset that runs just about any game out there with a GameBooster, there's nothing more you could expect in 2019, in this range. There's not a lot of bloatware and you can delete a few that do exist. The One UI is well optimised and the dark mode seems pretty helpful. If you're looking for anything in the &lt; 20-25k, don't think twice. Heck, if you're even going for something above that, it's still worth a shot.

The nice thing about the phone is the display which is in par with the flagship phones.

In terms of the build quality the phone feels rock solid, feels good to hold.

Expected the camera to be working at least like the mid range level phones, however surprised to look at the cheap quality images. The 48 megapixels are just a number here and do not reflect the actual performance.

Overall a decent phone to use, for those who are looking specifically for camera purpose wouldn't recommend the same.

After delivery i could able to see a tag mentioning only Indian sim, which is not mention in description when i asked about technical people it will work after 72 hours of mobile activation , when i check with Samsung technical person told it works after 15 mins usage of Indian sim in abroad . They have given an answer we have to check mobile website before we buy finally disconnected the cal with out giving solution.very disappointing just giving some statement to complete the cal.

I got android10 upgrade in mid of march and after upgrading the phone to android10, wifi is not working properly
1. Disconnects frequently. Doesn't connect to wifi for more than 10minutes. after connecting to wifi network, within 10 minutes disconnects
2. Sometimes: Connects without internet
3. Even if wifi connects for long time, internet will be very slow. Same network in other devices is very fast

This phone is absolutely awesome. The battery lasts more than 24 hours even if u use it continuously. U can play any mobile game and it runs very very smooth with 6GB RAM and an awesome processor. And the camera...no words. U will not get the feel till u yourself witness it. The display is very nice and the screen is strong. The storage is 128 GB which can never be exhausted. And despite so many features, the price is only 17000.

Battery not that monstrous but monstrous time takes to charge it. 3+ hours for full charge and drains in one and half day.
Camera works bad at low light.
My opinion is this is an average phone but okay for 16k price for 6gb+128gb combination in Samsung brand.

SAMSUNG is always at it's best. M30S model was awesome as said by the company. I've been using for above 10 days and I am loving it. Battery back life was superb, display was awesome(not only this product, every samsung device has best display at its best. One UI interface was super cool 😎. As I was a samsung lover I own the features that samsung provide. Fingerprint reader's quickness, face detection accuracy, build quality and lot more....... Every element in this device was at top notch.

The product is good gr8 battery life good camera. However after the 7d screen guard sometimes it lags a bit of power. I think samsung shld think of adding more xpu power instead of increasing the ram. The camera quality is good but it can be better especially the night view camera. Battery life is great i would say the best. The screen resolution is good but during the day sometimes more resolutikn is required. Fingerprint reader is great but if your hands are wet it will not work.

Writing this review after a week of continuous use. Superb, fast &amp; responsive phone with user friendly features. Not a game addict hance cant comment on that but gives a professional look &amp;good for business use. Camers quality is good as well. Initially faced some network issue but later it turned out to be problem of Idea. It sucks. Switched tk Airtel &amp;the phone is skyrocketing the internet speed &amp;clarity of calls. Cant ask more than this at the price being offered. Kudos Samsung!

After using the phone for about 6-7 months, it started hanging and restarting on its own. Tried factory reset, hard reset, safe mode and whatnot but nothing worked on it. After submitting to the service center, they informed me that the motherboard has crashed.

What kind of a phone is this if the motherboard crashes within a few months of purchasing.

Absolutely disgusted and disappointed with the purchase. Worst phone ever bought!

Its been a week since i have started using the M30s mobile. Using a Samsung mobile after a gap of 4 years. The quality of a samsung product is always better than any cheaper model mobiles like xiaomi or Yu.  the Samoled display is good with a better battery capacity. samsung could have concentrated on the processor. Still better if you arent a gaming freak. Totally a good purchase after a long time. Hope Samsung provides andorid 10.0 update to this series.

One of the worst product interms of camera.I had lot of expectations on this mobile by looking at the specs..i have bought many samsung mobiles. This is the first time having bad experience and made me to never attempt to buy samsung. I was thinking to buy mi note 7 pro, but previous experience of samsung made me to purchase this. Not worthy mobile and frustrated interms of camera. Even 8 MP camera is fine compare to this mobile 48 MP. Dont try to purchase if you think about camera.only battery life is good.

I am using this ph for more than one month and very much satisfied with its performance.
Excellent display, very good battery life. I am a heavy user and getting around two days battery backup. Sound quality with earphone is very satisfying. No network reception issue is faced by me.  Accidentally my ph fallen in a drain and recovered the same after 15 minutes and cleaned with water and surprised
 to see it in working condition. Thanks to Samsung for its build quality.

The best thing about this phone is its massive 6000mah battery. Its lasts for a day even after heavy usage. 48mp Camera is also good but its a bit slow. Specially when you click pictures in night mode u have to hold the phone still for 3 seconds. Fingerprint reader is not as quick as in other phones. It works 2 out of 3 times. Display is awesome. Processor performance is also good. No lags observed yet. Overall its a good choice to opt for if you are looking for a mid range phone.

Good phone. Some people report network issues;however, I haven't noticed any issue with call quality. Camera is above average unless you expect a dslr bundled with your phone you'll be fine. Best part, wide angle lense .. Why should you buy? You like long battery life with good camera and a wide angle shot to boast. Also, it's non cluttery unlike MI.. Make sure you get a tempered glass. (Gupta drop test)

Top notch display, great battery back up and AI battery utilization monitoring. Sound is also great and multitasking with this Exynos processor is butter smooth. Camera is giving good shots with high quality even in indoor dark conditions and selfie camera is also good. Must go for it.....review given after a weeks usage

The product is good, worth to buy at this price. But it does not have a gorilla glass. This is the most negative thing with this. So please consider before buying that if you are a rough user then a minor fall of phone will damage the screen.

Received the phone within 2 days of placing the order. 5 star for the delivery

Coming to the phone, the looks is rich and it does not appear like a 13K phone. It has a more rich look. Camera quality is awesome with its 48mp camera. Even better than phones double its range. Photos come crisp clear with great color definition.

Fingerprint reader is pretty fast and takes less than 1 second to unlock the phone

Battery is giant with 6000mAh and I am getting 2 days of backup easily with normal usage.

It's very hard for any company to sell a product like this in such a reasonable amount of money.
I bought this phone couple of weeks before. And since then it has blown up her mind. This phone is really very cool. The SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY given by phone is really amazing. I really enjoyed the POTRAIT MODE AND SUPER SLOW MOTION of the camera.The PROCESSOR is extremely cool. The Best about this phone is it's super 6000mah BATERRY which gives a vey long battery backup. In short I really loved the phone.

Camera quality is really good.
Face recognition works very fast.
Finger print sensor also works good.
Battery life is not upto the mark, even it is coming with 6000mah it last for one and a half days. Expected 2 full days.
4GB RAM and 64GB ROM is really enough and processor is also good. No lagging.
Gaming I don't have any idea, cos I am not used for games.
Overall the phone is good for this range.
My rating will be 4/5.

It is a good product but iit seems it has some issue with data network. Data connectivity is very poor in this phone. At same lication, with same service provider other phones are working so fast, while this has handset is lacking. Not getting 3G network also where full 4G network is available.

I am writing this review after 1 month of use.
Pros
1. Camera quality is satisfactory at this price.
2. Fingerprint sensor working fine.
3. Battery Backup of this phone is unmatchable. Non other phone available in market can compete with it's battery. With normal use it will last upto 2 days.
4. Samsung display is always stand apart compare to other phones in market.

Cons:
No cons observed but it will be better if Samsung improve the camera quality by software update.

I am quite impressed with the performance of my new M30s. As promoted a Monster, I found one in terms of Great Battery life and fast charging mode. With a full charge, the battery goes to 36-48hrs with nice uses(Without playing heavy gamings.) With games and videos played then itself, it lasts till 36hrs approximately which is also great in those terms.
Camera and features are also good as compared with the same budget SMARTPHONES in market.

Fingerprint reader does not read as fast as expected. Also at 6000MAh battery drains in around 5-6 Hours at maximum use which compared to redmi 6pro's 4000MAh battery is not much of power backup. Camera on the other hand is amazing in daylight. But at night front camera clicks pixelated images...expected a bit more from samsung on it's front shooter. Performance overall is really good. Plastic back body is easy to get scratched with if not using a phone cover. No heating up and no lagging that's for sure.

PROS:
1. Battery and fast charge. On normal use battery lasts almost 2 days, and charges approximately 1% per minute.
2. Display is nice.
3. OneUI

CONS:
1. There is no Gorilla glass, so DO NOT DROP THIS ONE, EVEN FROM ONE FOOT HEIGHT. Use only with cover.
2. Camera is not worth being called 48MP, don't expect much. also wide-angle lens is pretty much useless.

Last time a phone made me feel so relaxed for battery was probably Nokia 1100 . This is that kind of phone, charge once and forget for 2_3 days, for ordinary users.  Blessing. :) This is like having a phone with inbuilt power bank. Camera is great , picture quality is great. Processors look up to the mark till date in my usage. The best phone in market now. You can buy yourself phone worth A lakh Rs and still need a power bank back up. Not with this one,  with all the great features and the battery this one is a steal.

The Phone is very good. The built quality is not very good. The plastic quality is not very good. Very shining body in shades-not good. Battery life is alright. Nowhere in the phone settings, the actual RAM is mentioned. Overall it is a good phone but not very good or excellent.

Best part of phone is its battery life... it's awesome from all other phones I have ever used in my life
It gives 2 day battery backup when charged 100%  with full day Net and Gaming

All the functions of this phone are best..
RAM ROM,Camera,Apps Settings ,Dual Apps ,Processor, Battery, Sound quality,Speakers,Gallery Collage Options ,Pics Editor

All are superb

Whoever is thinking to buy it...
Just Goahead Without Doubt 👍👍👍👍👍

Its a wonderful phone at this price range. It has quite decent camera quality but has a brilliant night mode.

Phone performance is good.  I am able to play call of duty without getting the phone lagged.

All the pros and cons are on one side and the battery performance is different.  With normal usage my phone lasts for 3 days.

Samsung one ui is also quite beautiful  and the suggestions in setting section is quite helpful

Review after 30days use
1) As specificed monster battery life. 12 hours with heavy usage &amp; 1.5 day with normal usage
2) Superb camera &amp; Great picture quality but If we saw same picture on other phone its getting blur may be because of its Amoled display
3) Another best thing about phone is it Amoled Display. Big screen size with superb display.
4) No heating issues as such
5) Little bit sowtware problem but Regular Security patches are updated by Samsung

This phone is very slow when I click any picture through camera it takes around 20 sec to get the picture saved in galary and till that time is shows the message saving...on your camera screen. Some times when you click onscreen back button to go on home screen let's say from camera it takes to much time some time you need to press home button instead of back button.. really bad as I have invested this much amount in this phone. Samsung should resolve this problems or provide a refund through Amazon...

The best phone I came across. It has everything like it's 48 mega pixel camera quality is excellent. I have to travel a lot for business purpose, earlier it was so difficult for me to get my mobile charged everytime, but now with my Samsung M30S Battery is like it will never drain. I do keep watching movies, continuously talking for hours, surf on social media but the battery never gets drain like before. Great phone in such a less price and that even of Samsung.

Waste phone, I have never hold phone with this speed, phone is more than normal slow, UI reflection changes are almost 3,4 seconds.  Pathetic really.

Never suggested to buy:(  wasted my money and it is really carring very heavy weight.

One more thing its non returnable, I wanted to return this phone after receiving because of its waste design and too much weight, but they denied.

Using this phone from past 15 days almost.

Camera quality seems like 13mp only,  apart from camera its a superb phone ,, Battery backup is exellent. I will charge it once in two days only. It has fast charging type c port. Good display. Dolby Atmos sound 👌👌 and it has a very big loud speaker which is the best thing. Finally i am satisfied with this phone. Worth buy it for Samsung lovers and heavy mobile users for battery backup. Pubg played very smoothly.

Decent looks and build quality.
Fingerprint sensor at the back is easy to reach.
Decent rear camera setup - 48MP main sensor + 8MP wide-angle lens + 5MP depth sensor.
Overall, the cameras on the M30s are decent for the price bracket, even though they are not the best (that title is shared by Xiaomi and Realme phones)
Monster 6000mAh battery delivers an incredible 2-3 days of usage easily, making for one of the largest battery life smartphones currently available.

I purchase Samsung M30s (4+64 gb) during its launch at the Amazon Great Indian festival sale. I am truly impressed by the super AMOLeD display and touch is pretty smooth as well. I thought with the 6000MaH battery it would be heavy which is not the case (just 14 gms up if you compare with M30 version). Battery lasted for 2 days with moderate to heavy usage. Lastly the triple camera with main camera being 48 mp makes it the best in market at the said price. I got all this in 11400. Thank you Amazon.

Phone is really good... Monster battery as said correctly... Battery life lasts long after full day use of internet,music,OTT etc. Camera quality is nice , sharp featured, wide lens very good . The fingerprint reader and face sensor takes less than a second to unlock the phone. The One UI is very good to use,very user friendly. A mid budget phone with extra features is good to buy and worth the money. Night mode is very useful feature.

Everything else is great about this phone.
Could do better with back panel, it's too slippery and doesn't feel premium although this is only a mid range phone.
For some reason the phone tends to hang in multitasking, like some virus ? This is the 1st week I'm using this phone so, definitely a problem.
Camera is great in natural lighting. Video sucks at night with flash. Comfortable,  screen is awesome , heating issue with games ...nothing major ...value for money

Display is neither super nor amoled. Worse than 2yrs old set.
Proximity sensor doesn't work properly
The contacts app which the dialer accesses for numbers doesn't show all the nos linked to one name
Malfunctioning  observed in gallery folder. Deleted image reappears.
Except battery life, don't think it offers anything better.
Advice- either stick to your old phone or go fir some other set, not this one. Not worth of this price.

Got this one today.
Activated With 57%batt.
Kept using for 2 hrs while setting, configuring.
Top back side got very warm. not sure how and why.
If it is going to impact performance we dont know.
However for other features at this price point this is a good option Samsung launched. Beats Vivo n Mi chinese brands.

Phone is good but after 4 days of working found 3 to 4 times display error as enclosed images SCREEN shot and within7 days warranty claim Amazone is not supported to registered complaints well as to send service personal home so this is very bad experience of Amazzon.

Guys before any new mobile request to please visit at Croma  Tata group  where price remains Moraless same .

Asamazone regarding service they pass on to Samsung store when they commit 7 days replacement policy. Take care with that.

Excellent phone. Stunning display and extremely fast and responsive fingerprint sensor. The interface is smooth and the camera quality is excellent.  The photos look great and effortless. The speakers are loud and give great quality sound. Great battery life. The apps work seamlessly...there is no delay or glitch. The pricing is excellent and makes for affordable technology.  Very pleased.

It overall good phone with tremendous good feactures which is provides in phone . Even the battery life is logn lasting ,never hanged during multiple usesing app at the one time that would be make phone different to other phone. The camaera quality is so good much what i excepted . I  should compare 48MP rear camera of samsung galaxy M30s with d-slr camera.surplush the fingerprint sensor is too fast as well as the face recognizing feacture are also quite good . M30s also provide UHD clearity in pubg.

If You are a battery hungry millennial who uses their phone for media consumption  then this is perfect phone for you!
You can easily get up 11.5 Hours of screen time for about 3 days of battery and the beautiful amoled panel is amazing for watching netflix or gaming for long hours in PUBG. I would highly recommend this underrated mid ranger for the price.

The mobile is ok with a good camera and battery life....The hidden problem specifically detected by me is that the phone has too many glitches.The calls dont connect well inspire of being in full network coverage area.Mobile hangs on and off very regularly and I have to restart it again and again.The screen just shuts on it's on for no rhyme and reason. I would like to return this particular model and upgrade to something better.
Please guide how to proceed to do the same

I have been using this mobile since from six months. It's working awesome and having nice options which are not found in other mobiles with in this price range.  Camera clarity is awesome especially during video recording its marvellous. Especially battery is working tremendous. I charge my mobile once in two days and use it for at least 8-9 hours per day. Finger print reader is working simply superb. Thanks to samsung team for such an awesome product.

Looks average.Back cover is made of plastic which does not give premium look like other phones at this price.
Display is super amoled which is fantastic.
Battery life is long enough (with normal use 48h after complete charging).Fast charging facility is given.
But camera quality is not upto the mark as it is 48 MP. Pictures are average and it take some time to save after click.
Overall its a good choice at this price..

After using it for 15 days, I am writing about the phone. Battery back up is excellent as with moderate use I use only 20% of battery in 24 hrs. Camera may good I haven't used it. Sound is also very good for listening to music.

Two things that are missing are secure folder and NFC support. Samsung should have included at least secure folder. I have given four stars for only this reason.

Otherwise for most of uses, the phone is best with really awesome battery back up.
-----

Even though it has tons of features the highlight is the battery. I am a lazy one when it comes to charging my phone, so this is perfect for me. For moderate use it can last even more than 3 days.

Battery life is awesome. 6000mh battery still 40% after 3 days.
Super clear screen and super performance.
Camera is good however somewhat less precise as compared to other 48MP. As I don't use camera much so not a big concern for me.
Size of Phone is too big, it is difficult to operate with single hand.
Otherwise,
Light weight and good value for money Phone.
I would recommend this Phone because first thing first, battery is used always.
There's no point in having 64MP and no battery life.

Excellent product better than mi. The camera is fabulous. I got it for 11600 after exchange and Bank discounts. You can't get a better deal. The touch is super sensitive. Voice quality is real good. Pictures are crystal clear. Internet connectivity is okay didn't see much of a difference from mi note 4. The processor is better as the response is real quick though I am an average user as I don't use games like pubg a lot.

M30s mobile is just an ordinary one with great promotion done before its release. The worst part is the camera, made of some ordinary lens which ONLY works in day light with very weak resolution. Battery life is not much to my expectation but average.

Product is good at this price. Camera clarity is nice, however on zooming the picture looks distorted inspite of 48 megapixels.
6000 mAh battery is first in class which also makes phone slightly bulkier. However it lasts just less than 48 hours with normal email usage,  around 60 minutes of video calling and social media usage...battery should have lasted more and this is just two months post purchase...it may further weaken

I think M30s is best opetion in Rs14000 range. First of all Samsung is the best brand in this price range for safety and security. And M30s is rally a Monster in battery. And camera quality is really good. And mobile is doing great job , only problem which i m facing is in gaming performance, my mobile got warm and very laggy when i play PubG in it. But this is not a big problem where samsung is offering many things with good quality in this price range , this is really best.

As per price range Overall is very good.
Except back camera. Back camera can't take good pictures in low light. Pics are look blackish in low light. Samsung must fix it in software updates.
Other features are good. Battery is also good.

After using the phone for 15 days, I could say that overall the phone is good, it has massive battery, good display along with some good user friendly features but I have 2 big complaints. First the back camera is not good at all and this was not expected from a Samsung smartphone. Second, the back panel catches scratch very easily, I used the phone without back cover for 2 days and now the back looks unattractive, this is a big disappointment for me as I don't usually prefer back covers.

Battery is fine.
Display is good in vivid mode.
This phone is not for gaming. Don't expect good performance.
I recommend this phone for those people who just want to buy Samsung phone or consume lots of media content aur for those peopy who use little bit social media.
Audio is not up to the mark loudspeaker is not very lound and headphone Jack is terrible.
You can buy better phones in this price range.

Hv used it for a week now. Battery lasts for around 24 hours with normal usage which is less than what was expected. It takes around 1.5 hours to charge from 10 to 100 percent. Display is awesome.
I observed that network was reduced in both my sims compared to the other phone. Please think before buying this if you have network issue in your area. Lastly, I also faced problem in slow motion and ultra slow motion video capture. It showed flickering under artificial lights which was strange.

I purchased samsung m30s mobile having best features  for an affordable price.Sound system is excellent  and AMOLED display no one beat its quality in display. Video quality is very clear and if you zoom it video will occupy entire screen having  good  resolution. Selfie cam is good and rear cam having 48mp worth of it. 6000mAH battery is getting 1 1/2 day. I will suggest to buy this mobile at 14k. budget.

Samsung Galaxy M30s - Samsung introduces a 6000 mAh battery for the first time in this price segment- along with all round features comprising of a 48 MP rear camera in triple camera set up and an immersive sAmoled screen.it
can be seen as an upgrade over the existing Galaxy M30. It retains its predecessor's good attributes, such as the crisp AMOLED display, and bumps the battery capacity up to 6,000mAh which helps deliver better battery life.............

Only one problem i have noticed with mic it has one mic only as compared to my note 8 i can hear voice from long distance and the other person talking along with caller can be heard easily.

But in m30s this feature lack due to single mic and if you keep phone little bit far away  other person cant hear your voice.

Other than this all features are great.

Product arrived with a backpanel issue and Amazon refused to replace despite being in return window and sent a service engineer who casually told it's a common issue. Upon visiting service center they confirmed the back panel issue exists and making a crackling sound. Worst ever purchase experience from Amazon.

This is one of the best phones you can go for in this price range.
Apart from the impressive battery life with a whopping 2 day run, the entire interface is engaging.
Although the camera takes some really sharp pictures, there is a central blur spot when you take macro shots! Overall, I'm in love with this phone and would recommend it to anyone looking for a change

In finally, thanks to Samsung for this great revaluation. Thank you so much.
I love Samsung Galaxy M30s.

I am using this device for last two months, overall satisfied. Fingerprint reader works fine. Camera is as good as 13MP not in in any case 48MP. Night Mode camera is extremely poor.
The USP of this phone is Battery Life which runs for full 2days with game, music and 4G chat, video call. Wide angle camera is a good feature but resolution of images through wide angle is poor.
Touchscreen is lags at times while using keypad.

I'm using Samsung Note 9, A50 which are good at their budget but M30s (6GB RAM, 128 GB Storage) is somewhat far more better at this Budget.. Battery is life is too good. The Mobile is too fast to handle any type of job without any lag. And there nothing more to say about Super Amoled Display which adds an extra battery life and colour variations, contrast. It charge fast, sound is good, look is unique.. Camera quality is more than average but it'll give a hard competition to other good camera phones..

Screen and battery is good. Camera lags but is sufficient for unprofessional shots. Software is nice though stock Android users will miss a bunch of things. Fingerprint reader is the real disappointment. It takes too long n only a fixed style of placement to read successfully. It's a good 15k category phone but there are better options in terms of hardware. The Chinese brands are better in this price unless you consider privacy.

I purchased this phone on 30 sep. Everything was alright at the time of purchase, after 2 months phone started to switch off. I serviced it in Samsung service center 3 time, but after 2,3 days of service I am facing the same problem. Now I am not able to switch on the phone. I need a replacement for this phone or refund of my money. If the phone is not able to use within 5 months of purchase then what is the use of paying 14000.

At first I was disappointed with the camera quality but after contacting with Samsung mamber I solved my problem and I have got the geat 48 mp camera quality.. I am giving my review after 1 month use (approximate) and I am impressed with the battery back up.. I plug it by after 2 days.. fingerprint sensor face lock and all the security and privacy set up are very very good.. thank you Samsung for increasing my trust on you more.

This particular mobile is very handy,  low budget,  high quality camera and screen,  battery powered by 6000 mah,  longer battery life.  Comparing with other competitors this mobile is best choice . Face recognition,  fingerprint lock open available.  Sound and voice calling experience is good.

You might feel not buying because some reviews have rated camera quality and performance as not that great. In this price range, it is better than all phones out there. Your phone might process an app function 0.230 sec slower, that's all.

Go for it. It's a great buying decision.

Never expected such a poor build quality from Samsung... Completely disappointed.

My nephew dropped mobile from sofa(hardly 3 feet) and the entrie display got damaged.... Had to spend again 4500 on it...

This is not at all a worthy hardware ... No matter how many things are Magical inside... They should have little focussed on built material too....

I am not commenting anything about software and features as it's good

At this price range this is a complete package.
Battery life of this phone is very good and its display is also awesome. And most important its system UI is near to stock android and very smooth and very less bloatware. But there are some drawback in this phone. As camera is not up to mark and its fingerprint senser is very slow. And these things could be improved. But overall  a good package. I bought this 6/128 GB variant only at 14300 after all discount.

The phone i got just a week early. Its colour gradient looks nice.  The display of phone is amoled and vivid mode is adding the colour. Overall design and look is good. Have some heating problem and body is seems week, plastic type body.  Internet strength is little bit low as i feel, but not tested so much. Have no any LED notification light.  Battery is 6000mAh, it should last for 2 days, rather it last for 1.5 day approx. But atleast camera  which we need so frequent is fine.

I have been using Samsung M30s since two months and I am fully satisfied with the mobile phone. It offers a massive 6000 mah battery which delivers a good battery life. It comes with a Super Amoled FHD+ display which delivers a more detailed and clearer display. The Samsung Exynos 9611 delivers a decent performance. Also, 48MP triple camera setup allows you to take awesome pictures with different modes. Providing all these features at this price point makes it really a value for money mobile phone.

Fingerprint works very well but not fast as expected most of times it works well ,camera wise they done a wonderful job.daylight photos are good even in low light also but in extreme low light images show more noise and also lose out some detals in wide angle shots in this price point camera was good,the mojar part the mobile is  the monster 6000 mah battery it takes 2 to 2.30 for complete charge . For an average user it gives 2 days  for heavy users its comes  one day easily about 8 hrs on screen with data connection..

#Gone Monster this season. Nice wholesome smart phone, valuable monster with decent camera (although low photo stabilization for taking pictures of text but good camera app), quality sound with added Dolby Atmos feature for headphones. All in better Samsung Galaxy configuration with good thoughtful apps ( Samsung sustainable goals and wellbeing apps are a great to go) and good interface similar to A series. Screen less pixy from A30. This monster gets you low SAR value and minimal UI adds.

For 6.4 inches super amoled display battery is a beast. With 8 hours of music play, 2 hours of tiktok, 2 hours of social media, with always on display turned on, wifi turned on and if the battery just drains 50% on the next morning then i think i cannot ask for more, the screen my god i can see the moles on tom cruise face in mission impossible 4. I am amazed simply amazed got it for 14000, got 1000 cashback on amazon pay then paid for it using credit card so another 500 discount. What more do u want people.... Go for it.

Excellent phone!!! Purchased it during Deepavali Amazon sale with good offers. Value for money. Camera quality and pictures are exceptiona. 4GB RAM is good to manage multiple applications and phone does not get heat nor slow down, with 64GB inbuilt memory it is good to load pictures and movies.

Overall the best phone in recent times which is budget friendly and loaded with excellent features.

Great phone from Samsung and would recommend for everyone.

Mobile is very good. But  my suggestion is better to buy mobiles from shop. While buying from shop rate will increase. But you will get warranty and invoice so you can claim for warranty. But when you bought from amazon they will make fool us and cheating. They didn't give invoice so we can't able for claim warranty.. Overall mobile is good. If the fingerprint sensor will in the screen will be good. Unfortunately this phone fingerprint is in rear side.overall mobile is good

Simple review is if u are searching a phone in the price range of 10k to 15k , this is the ONE. Keep calm and trust samsung. The Camera is the best in this price range . And talk about the battery ,its the best in all segments. I charge once in 2and half days since 2 months. Hasn't lagged once in this 2 months. I use it constantly for games , Instagram, WhatsApp downloads and movies and songs. Still the battery doesn't give up after two exhausting days of full capacity use.

Overall feedback is good. But some of the features are missing. It would be good, if we have these features in the upcoming Samsung products.

1. Notification light is missing. For all other mobiles even less rated mobiles also having the notification light option. But, here it is missing.
2. Speaker was available in bottom of the part. Some times unable to here the voice when it is in the shirt or pant pocket.

Hope this will be helpful for you.

Thank you so much!

The sapphire blue back colour of the Samsung galaxy m30s is amazing. Fingerprint reader is very quick responsive. Back camera picture quality is very dense and sharp it's really good. Front camera is very responsive and fast to unlock and pictures are great. Overall camera quality is awesome. The best part is the battery life that seems to never die quickly. It can go on without worrying to recharge for the while day or even for 2 days sometimes with heavy use also

One of the worst phone  I have ever buy. Not reached expectations. Battery is not 6000mah , it is 600mah I think. Within 4hours the battery status is becomes ZERO(Without playing games,Data is off in sometimes) from 100, Note: Battery takes 4hours to full. After one month I was realised that,Finally I was cheated by the company Samsung and Amazon. WORST WORST WORSE.
Only better(NOT BEST) one is LED GLASS AND CAMERA.

Value for money product. Best features of this phone are battery back up, with normal usage I get 7 to 8 hrs of screen on time and the amoled display. Performance is decent. Network reception is the weakest point of this phone. Both for phone calls and more Importantly data speeds(4g) is horrible. I work from home hence have a wifi so not too much of an issue for me but for those who plan to use this phone on mobile data please don't buy this phone!

As good as it should be with all the things without camera.  Its camera is so bad even my old galaxy J7 has a better camera than this. Autofocus is not even a thing here. Only the telephoto lens is a little better. The 48 mp is literally of no use. Its photos show zero details of the object. So disappointed with the camera.

I brought this M30S in 6/128 GB blue variant and after use of 20 days i can say it fail in strd level. Poor camera quality, poor speaker and many lags.
I purchased cell after long time and feeling sad it didnt deliver as my expection. Gaming experience is worst on this cell, i can't even imagine what will be result of its smaller version users.
Anyway its my fault, I should've wait for reviews and should've purchased higher model.
My final word wait for better option.

Camera software could have been much better with better image stabilization and Video stabilization needs much improvement, Along with that refresh rate drops at certain frame while playing games.
Application management can also be improved, since it is having a powerful processor at this proce range.

Super Amoled Is consumes Bettery little high in compare of M20.
But screen Resolution is Awesome.
After Full charge, it uses as near as 38-48 hours, depends on uses.
Its Functions and Features is best, not feels like China Mobile.
And the best part is GESTURES of that phones you never seems before.
1.Double tap to ON the screen.
2. Screen can't off when you looking on it.
3.Double tap to wake up the screen.
And much more
SAMSUNG Is SAMSUNG.

Studied articles about Samsug M30s and Redmi note8 pro  and finally decided to choose the former one. This is Excellent phone. Battery is a beast, runs for 2.5 days. Phone Performance is good. Display is excellent. Camera is a little let down, hoping a software update would improve it. My recommendation is to buy tempered glass,  phone cover and buy phone insurance, as i see this doesn't have gorilla glass.

the phone is great overall. excellent in all manners. amazing amoled display. not yet tested the battery performance.
but why is samsung lying about the camera? it says 48 MP but the pictures are very blurry. colour reproduction and dynamic range is good but no pixel sharpness at all. i was expecting a mediocre camera but did not expect camera to be so basic.

Battery back up : workhorse battery by far the best I have used till date .
Display :  one of the Samsung s best
Charging : satisfactory however it can be improved,  a bit slow compared to one plus dash charging
Camera : very good in the range
Speed : fairly well

Overall a very good product in the price range , finally samsung is back with a bang.
Highly recommended product for the younger generation

Delivery experience is very bad. Twice or thrice complaining to customer care but still not get the parcel at home. I have to go 1-2 km away from my house to get the parcel. Very bad experience.

Battery life is too good. Fingerprint sensor is little bit less effective, sometimes it could not on while we touch the fingerprint but face recognition is much better.
Else overall features are good.

This phone looks impressive and acts as a real threat to existing devices in the same price segment from the likes of Xiaomi and Realme.
Really loves its Triple Camera, which helps one to shoot the Ultrawide pictures.
The ability to record super-slomo and hyper-lapse videos is a big plus.
I truly love the display on the M30, it is capable of providing a great viewing experience.
The battery lasts long and you don’t have to worry about charging your phone daily anymore.

I have got the phone 2 weeks back and it never got hanged till now. But there is a problem I have e faced with camera. The image stabilization takes time. Most of the times the images from the rear camera are blurred. But the front camera is up to the mark. I hope some system update from Samsung will resolve this camera issue in near future.

Well i think  after a week usage of this phone Samsung galaxy m30s my opinion  is its a good phone covering  most of the aspects  that i need the device  performance, device ram management , device  UI, the battery and the most important  the sAmoled display and some other stuff; but i was a little  disappointed  too -- with the camera and sound from 3.5mm jack outputs the bass was low but the audio  quality was superb i hope its just a software  issue  and Samsung  may clear this issue with an update 😃😃😃😇😇

But this is my honest review on M30S mobile

* Average life of battery
* Very very poor signal reception which I never seen in any of samsung mobiles

Finally don't waste ur valueable money on M30S mobile

A Samsung phone with such many features in this budget is itself a big plus point. It looks really high-end and the gradient effect on the back panel is great, bezels around the screen are thin. As for the working, it has a great display you can also choose vivid mode in settings . It provides a long battery life which easily lasts 2 days. Processing is also good, so far the usage feels really smooth , games too run without any lag. It has 48mp back n 16mp front camera. At this price, i would say  Go for it!

Reviewing after 16 days of usage.
Good product
But I don't think the battery is 6000mah.. 6000mah battery could give more backup.
Careful when you inserting sim card
My one sim card damaged when I inserted, i don't know how that happened, but other sim cards working fine.
For gaming it's not a better phone.
You can play pubg smooth in hd high settings.
About ram i only get 3gb ram, system taking 3gb ram for what?

Delivered within 48 hours.
Looks awesome.
 it contain 600 mah massive battery. this is the main plus point in this price point. the second advantage is the processor. Samsung has used the most advanced processor i this price range which can handle multiple complex situations except heavy games.

Battery was 53% when I switched on..and after 2 hours of continuous use it is 49% now.
Camera is awesome.
Sound is loud.
Display is amazing.
Mine is Opal black one.

Only good thing about the product is its battery. That too not as per they hype created around it. Battery lasted 2.5 days on full charge. This is when I dont use it for gaming and neither I am a heavy app user.

Camera is the worst that I have used in last 10 years. All images are blurred and of low quality.

Display is Okay. Doesnt give delighted experience.

Its okay to buy the product if once is not expecting too much from Camera.

I ordered this for my mother.. For her I wanted is best display and the SAmoled screen does the job.
My mother is extremely happy with M30S and apart from display, she likes the fact the phone goes on and on without charging now and then.
Very good product and I recommend this above the others.
Most importantly I got the product delivered within 6 hours which shows how Amazon live up to it words.

But the sound quality of the speaker is not too good at higher volume but yeah satisfying and the front camera is also great clicking selfies but yeah there's an issue while clicking snaps it automatically zooms in when using front camera. At the end it's the best phone under 15000 with great battery life and camera.

Pros- Monstrous battery life is really good though it needs more optimisation as it should be more like 6000 mah...But still it behaves like 5000 mah here..so it needs a little improvement here...satisfied with the processor and display is quite good too.
Cons- I am not satisfied especially with the camera performance ...though the rear camera is 48 mp...the pictures clicked are smooth and lack sharpness...it behaves like a 13mp camera and selfie camera is also poor.The fingerprint is also a bit on the slow side

The worst phone which I have ever purchased in my life. Back camera is 48 Mpixel but actual image looks like image taken from 8Mpixel camera. Also my phone is not recognising external memory card. Same is communicated to Amazon also but no solution n not replacing my phone.
I strongly recommend not to purchase this phone.

Recently bought this M30s and i am feeling very happy about it. It has excellent battery life (2 days with mobile data on, which is very cool :p). Camera quality and its features are absolutely very nice. I love taking pics in this new mobile. I am not much of an Android user. But this mobile, made me love it. Missing secure folder and front flash option though :( Dynamic changing lock screens :p , Body finish and front camera position.. Totally, i like this mobile :):)

Awesome product at this price.. very fast processor.. but battery not as expected. Plus : Screen resolution high grade, Ram very fast, storage more than enough.. back camera very nice, but front camera not as expected. 6000 mah battery last up to one day only for medium use without any games.. voice clarity very nice. Fast charging as expected. But cable length very small. Touch good sensitive..  overall good product at this cost level.. thanks to Samsung. Moreover made in India product.. love it.

only I can say all is well except camera &amp; video quality. It is much below standard.
Just I  discovered that it doesn't have  facility of 'Secure Folder' , which is bery essential to keep some items secure.
I contacted with Samsung team but they concluded with .. contact with our developer'.
I expect that needful action may be taken &amp; the faciloity available to customers.
Its battery is not fast charging. It takes about 5to6 hrs for charging 30% to 99%

Here are the bullet points i like about the phone
1) Excellent screen quality better than any other amoled device out there in this price.
2) Very good battery life
3) Very fast for daily use and light gaming.
4) Build quality could have been better but no complaints at this price.
5) Looks wise also its excellent specially in opal black with green tint
no negatives observed till date. Samsung could have included a simple headphone at-least in the box.

First Class Delivery by Amazon - Delivered within 4 hours (on 28th September)
With pretty decent specs, amazing display, satisfactory camera performance, &amp; a long battery life, this is a must buy if you're in a looking for a phone in budget segment (sub-15k). Low light, slo-mo modes aren't impressive though.

Good Product, finger print reader is not reachable though. Face detection has 80% accuracy. Battery performance is good. Light weight and good colour combinations available. Over all, it’s a good budget phone.

Very nice cell. 6000mAh battery and c type charge with fast charger. It Can be used for 2 days without charging.
Camera is awesome . Night mode of camera is very good . Also video stabilization feature is very nice.
No lag while playing heavy games like pubg and call of duty.
I recommend this mobile who want better battery back up.
Fingerprint reader is also fast. Also face recognizing feature is much faster.

Great phone. Completely worth the money. The fingerprint reader correctly reads the finger almost 95% of the time at the first try. Camera quality is top notch, able to zoom to ridiculous level of detail on photos. I was able to even zoom to see individual threads of fabric in a photo shot from 5ft away. Although touted as monster battery, capacity is still lacking when running on my usual load of apps, but way better than my old phone which needed to be charged 2-3 times a day on the same load of background apps.

The device is not at all worth of 14,000 bucks it should  b priced at 10,000 so ya clearly  wasting 4000 bucks. The camera is poor it's not 48 mph I dont even think it is 16 mp its worse it's like 8 mp camera my mom redmi 7 clicks way better pics than this. The network  reception is poor build quality  is poor only the battery and screen quality  is good so dont waste ur money and go for some other brand they I'll b Providing  real value for money.one more thing AMAZON is worse and go for FLIPKART they are the best.

Data network speed problem when u change 1 place/city to other place/city. Only data network problem occurs voice call network is ok during place change. After new place i have to restart or disconnected data or on/off flight mode to reconnect data speed. In the same place and same network provider, other phone's data speed is perfect while Samsung's galaxy M30s model is defective and unsuccessful

Battery is not 6000mah. It goes down 3% to 4% on idle mode (night). And the the 6GB ram gives performance of  2GB, e.g. simple games at times are glitchy, and most noticeable one is when I take a picture on Live focus mode it takes good 4 to 5 secs for picture to preview (cam effect). Overall I regret buying this phone. Was hoping Samsung would have maintained its quality ...but this phone is a disappointment...and I bought this phone from Samsung's website directly.

Quality product from Samsung..I was using redmi note 5 pro earlier.. lot of wows especially user interface is smooth ie the OS.. Battery life is awesome.. Camera quality in daylight is superb but low light is just ok... Sound quality and call reception excellent... Definitely recommend...

On top of all, I bought it for just 7k with exchange that's a steal....

Nothing in the phone is good except the battery life. The phone is a mid-level phone which deserves price not more than 8k. The phone hangs frequently and also lags in many cases. I was also struggling to work on Alexa app with this phone. I don't understand why Samsung is selling this crap. I was using Samsung Galaxy On Max since 2 years which was a masterpiece. I really regret purchasing it.

I always buy samsung and have used multiple phones like grand neo, J7, A7 etc.
But once I bought M30s my experience changed 360 degree. I have never seen such a great configuration at reasonable cost. Battery life is awesome and camera have lots of amazing features like slow motion, super slow motion, burst mode, various size click and emoji editing etc and many more uncountable features with 48mega pixel.
I gotta fan of such an amazing product from Samsung.

Excellent phone with good processor but lacks in gpu performance as compared to redmi note 8 pro..display is brilliant..best in class
Very big in size so it's not for one handed use. Camera is overated as there is not much difference between 48 mp images and 12 mp regular..wide angle lens is good enough.

Good first impression of using Galaxy M30S.
Phone does not feel heavy even with 6.4 inch screen and 6000 mAh battery, may be because of the plastic body.
Screen quality is good.
Device works good without lagging.
6000 mAh Battery is the biggest plus point in this device. It easily lasts for more than 2 days with above average usage.
Sapphire blue colour is a bit on the brighter side I feel. Should have considered buying Black colour.
Overall  a good phone in the price range.

Very worst mobile don't buy it
Camera quality is very low like 16 mp only
My realme mobile 16 mp camera is very best than this
Battery is only ok ok 6000mah but it is running only 24 hrs that to not for full use normaly
And ram very worst  I am using only 10 apps aditional to system apps it is hanging still.

Better to choose another any one.

Absolute value for money product. Deal not to be missed if getting some extra discounts.

Battery backup &amp; display is awesome. I am charging this device on every 4th day for moderate use. Rear camera is gr8 &amp; front is a bit on a smoother side. Performance wise also gr8, although I don't play games much but I use internet very heavily and I haven't encountered any lag till now. Sound quality is also nice on both headsets and phone.
Go for it 👍

Yes, its a fabulous creation by samsung for those who are full day net user. I am using this phone since 2 months and you wont believe even after extensive talk along with other apps like Fb, whatsapp, mails, and other so many apps running full day ( I do not play game ) , at the end of the day, its still show more than 70% battery back up. Camera both rear and front are superb. As a whole so many features and benefit is just unbelievable at so much affordable price.

Samsung M30s is pretty good in terms of overall performance. The build quality and battery back up is excellent. However the camera quality is not what we expect from 4MP sensor, especially in low light conditions. Also, the images get blurred on zooming. Samsung needs to work on this, but camera capture fine details and natural colors. Does not change colors or increase brightness like Oppo, Vivo or Realme. The Overall performance is good.

Battery is not as good as promised. My Zenfone Maxpro M1 with 5000 mah has better battery performance. When playing videos on Netflix, Amazon prime and Hotstar, only sound comes and no picture is visible. Samsung customer care is also horrible, with most disrespectful staff members. They will make you run between service centers again and again. I paid Rs 17000 for the phone bit have not used the phone even for 2 days because of these issue.

Samsung, you suck at everything.

Received this product today and when I tried to switch it on it was just not getting on n when I plugged on the charger it showed some sort of coding n then showed zero percent charge I don't get it how can you send a phone with a zero percentage of charge atleast it should have some percentage so that I can switch it on. Like idk which mobile company even does that the looks are good but at least the Samsung should have some brains to send a phone atleast half charged

Samsung Galaxy M30s is one of the best phone I have used according to  price it's the best the company can offer with all latest feature this phone is a must buy ... It's fingerprint reader option is very smooth and very convenient to use 👍... Camera clarity is so good to compare for other latest launch phone... I have used this phone from last one month and the best part is it's battery life ... It's one time charge for next 24 hrs... I completely recommend this phone, it's really value for money 🤗

Product quality is too low and not as per the expectations and price. I was not expecting this kind of worst camera quality from Samsung(10 megapixel of any other phone is far better than 48 megapixel Samsung camera) . Also there is no exchange available on AMAZON for this product, so think twice before you by from AMAZON.

Used for about 1 month.
Display- nothing to say. Very best. Samsung done his job
Battery- super... 6000 mah. Weight is very less when we compared to other 5000 mah battery phones.
Camera- it is good as we look into price. Good quality.
Sensors- very bad impression. Fingerprint is not very much good.
Compass and other sensors are not as much as good. Samsung has to do better.
Overall it is very good phone in this budget. And i loved it very much

Just after two days I got a minor scratch over display without any major accidental cause, may be due charge cable. It's even hard to believe.
Display is so thin and relatively less resistant to damages.

Amazing super AMOLED display and light weight body.👌
Wonderful battery performance, more than what I was expecting from 6000mAh.
Camera is good, specially for wide angle photos.
Performance wise also its better than Snapdragon 845.

1. It is a very good phone at this price range given the specifications.
2. Battery is very good. It lasted for almost 2 days with moderate usage for last charge.
3. Sound quality and dipaly is excellent.
4. Though there are other phones in the same price range, it has got samsung brand to it.
5. Screen replacement offer

Camera is good in day light but could be btter in low light. Overall quite
 satisfactory. Amazon delivery was as always excellent.

Most striking feature of this mobile is it's monstrous 6000 mAh battery... Coupled along with the exynos processor and  it's 6 GB RAM, this phone offers a flawless gaming experience... I've tried both PUBG and COD and the performance is very good... The battery doesn't get heated up often and the fast charging feature makes sure that you can charge your phone real quick... Camera quality is ok but overall, it's a very good phone for ₹17k...

For long I was waiting for the launch of a smart phone at a reasonable price and also with better battery longetivity upon usage. And Samsung M30S truly fulfilled it. I compared with the other variants and also brands, and decided to order without a second thought, though I already had two smart phones. Others do not hesitate, as it is certainly a better phone at present in the market. However I see a little slow download and installation of apps from playstore. But that doesn't matter much in buying this phone.

Super steady video at night is up to the mark.
Though in normal mode you good video quality.
Back cover makes a click sound  when pressed on the sides.
I only brought these because of 6000 Maher thing. And it's worth it.

Has restarted on its own several times now. Laggy and slow UI. Best battery life. Video playback is not smooth. Too much Samsung bloatware. Not recommended. Amazon Support does not help in replacing or returning the item. They will ask you to install Blancco app and check if anything is wrong. Restarting problem will not be shown in the app. Not the kind of service expected from Amazon. Please do not buy again.

Samsung has highlighted two things in this model. 6000mAh battery and 48 Mega pixel camera.
Battery backup is fine but camera quality is very very very poor. Not even looks like a 11 mega pixal camera.  Quality of picturs are dam bad.
Samsung is cheating its customers... no reliability or credibility is left. This phone is just zero becase of the camera.
I have became the victim of Samsung trap...
I suggest not to think of buying of this phone...

The phone has stood above my expectations. The battery back up is too good as promised. Camera features along with updates are excellent although there are lot of improvments to be made during low light scene. A huge thumbsup for the interface One UI. This software can be matched with high end flagship phones of Samsung (except few features). Totally user convenient and much helpful in day to day use. Being a moderate user of phone, I am totally satisfied with M30s.

I am proud owner of this value for money product.What more could a customer expect at this price point.
I agree that there are many Chinese competitors who offer good phones at a competitive price or even less but then comes the question of security and reliability.
This Samsung phone is a great buy. I would  recommend it to anybody anytime until there is a next successor of this great phone.
I hope Samsung makes the next model successor in a glass build body.

It was the one of the best decision i made this year to buy this phone

1) Very good fingerprint reader
2) good camera quality, specially night more i really like the way night mode worked.
3) As 6000 MAH battery it should stay longer, so little bit disappointed with battery i have very normal use, no game, no social media, only whatapps and attending the call, full charge 100% battery stay not more than 30 hours.
4) Fast charging also not upto the mark, it should to charge 2:30-3:00 hours to get the battery full charge.

Camera quality is excellent.  Very good night mode. Really liked the details being captured... Battery life has been really good too.. I haven't needed to charge for 2 days now... Screen is very good.. smooth n nice colors and vivid display... videos look really good on fullscreen... Phone is not very heavy even with the big battery and feels really premium... one thing that would have made this a really great package was a cover n tempered glass.. overall a very good phone..

The battery life is just as advertised "Monster". Hence this phone is suitable for people on the move as carrying power banks is a big hassle. Camera quality is excellent. Good low light and panaromic photos.
Good quality sound and ringtone volume is amazing, making this phone suitable for elder ladies who forget their phones in the depths of their purse.
Display is crystal clear.
I purchased this phone for myself and my mom and we both are satisfied with its quality.

This is the core reason for purchasing Samsung M30s after a long wait of 8 months without a smartphone. The reliable phone in terms of network and connectivity. In addition smart features like camera, security and marathon battery is bonus to the investment. Thank you team Samsung for my best smartphone till date.

Fingerprint reader
It's not up to the level. Ok ok

Camera
Front camera is worst

Battery life:
It's not 6000mh battery. Normal charging only

Main issue is I have faced is heating issue when I do calls and charging

Getting headache when I see the mobile and talking on phone.

No option to return or replacement
Please don't buy this phone on amazon

Don't buy electronics  on Amazon or online

Battery is awsm can easily go without  charging for 2 days for normal usage.
 Rear camera is amazingly good at this price range. Android one ui is relatively  smoother. pubg runs well in medium setting without  any heating. phone starts to heat a little in high setting. Luckily there is no network  issue in my phone  so far as faced  my few users. Only con for me so far is build quality of backcover

The fingerprint reader is quite easier and the only thing is it just unlocks the mobile there's no locking through this option....I love the camera quality and the features they are truly awesome I became a photographer after buying this mobile 😃...coming to the battery level it's really doing justice....I'm charging my mobile once in 2 days though I watch lots of videos and play games 🙃no need of power banks....
Overall....I am in love with Samsung Galaxy M30S..🥰

Great phone.  Puts up with daily life battery strains. Battery life very good. Games are also running smoothly.  Camera is a good but cannot be compared with a high end phone.  Does all the job find good overall budget phone for all your needs.  Be it gaming productivity and lifestyle .

TOO MUCH HEATING!

Even mobile screen surface is getting heat for no reasons, without uses of (any calls nor Data). Very bad experience with a Samsung mobile!

Also Amazon service call center didn't gave proper direction to fix the problem or exchange the mobile behind our many requests. They just passed the days till the retrun duration get completed.

I'll Neverever by any Samsung product in Amezon. Got cheated! Thinking to switch to other better App than Amazon.

It was amazing one Samsung m30s. It's good one value for money, amazing display I order on 30th Sep 3019 i got this on 1st October 2019. but in this company not providing hands free (head phone) is very bad on it, there is no crash (temper) class with this phone we have to Purchase temper class separately. android 9 is amazing settings is superb. little bit take time to understand.

By seeing the brand name itself you can go for it. Its the samsung once again came up with budget smartphone with monster features.
The battery is excellent with 6000mah which lasts all day.
Triple camera with wide angle and depth sensor and camera quality is awesome
And the samsung one core ui is easy and feature loaded
Try once you will be amazed.
With Samsung M30s you can just
GO MONSTER!!

Samsung have come up with a new phone m30s which is like a change of era towards best smartphone.The battery monster of 6000mah is amazing which can stand up to 2 days .
The camera quality is just LIT .Its definitely challenging the other smartphone brands in camera quality .
Though the fingerprint reader is less sensitive the face unlock is much better and effective .
I would like to thank samsung for coming up with such a amazing phone ,cost effective and efficient .

I like this phone very much. Very sensitive fingureprint reader, good battery life with average camera quality, which is acceptable in this price range. I bought this phone for my mother and great part for me she likes it very much because she was very conscious about the comolex functionality of todays smart phone. But she is very much familiar with this phone within few hour of delivery. Now for me this is  पैसा बसूल.

Tired of charging your phone all day. Then here is a phone for you that gives immense power with 6000mah battery.
If ur main purpose is to surf the net, chat on whatsapp or instagram or snapchat, or play video on YouTube or to listen songs then this is the best buy for you.
Camera quality is good in day light and average in normal room light. Night mode is good.
This phone has good processor which can used if u r playing pubg or cod.
Overall its a decent phone

I exchange MI 5 to get M30s,
My observations between  mi and Sam
1)Mi uses second space which can miss lead kids and youth..but SAMSUNG GIVEN "WELL BEING " OPTION WITH MOBILE USAGE DATA,WHICH HELPS THE CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE  SCREEN TIME.

2)mi interface has lot of ads but SAMSUNG HAS VERY LESS OR ZERO ADS.

3)mi has poor ram  MANAGMENT but Samsung has good ram MANAGMENT..

Thank u Samsung...

The is completely acceptable in the price to product scenario.The most I liked is display,it's is awesome.I feel the rare camera is best in the class and may be front camera quality could be improved though it's better for it's price but for a selfie enthusiast it's ok .The battery life is best with it's monster 6000mah battrey.For an all round user it is the best product to buy in this price.And I feel , Samsung this time really caught the nerve of the user..enjoying Samsung  m30s.

Within one week this starts to get slowdown the performance. The fingerprint sensor is also not fast like first day of purchased. Battery is not as much as expected. Especially the camera quality is worst when compared to other 48 megapixel phones. Still iam confused whether it have 48 pixel or not.. worst phone. There is only replacement policy.. which means by replacing again we get this same phone( Samsung Galaxy m30s). So we will get trapped any way

Please don't buy this phone

Elegant looks.
Display quality is brilliant.
Cameras are lovely.And charging speed is great thanks to inbox 15w charger. For a average regular user having not much interest of playing games I would definitely recommend this. Moreover, design is literally premium and and finally Brand is Samsung
CAMERA: The camera does not meet my expectations.... Not perform best in low light conditions which is okay for a phone priced at 20K.
Fingerprint: is little slow or lag
Battery: is ok

As a high end phone user, this phone samsung M30s came as a pleasant surprise. It literally has every aspect of whatever we wanted in a phone, be it amazing battery or best in line processor from the manufacturer, exceptionally good cameras etc... Practically the only thing missing is a good headphone. But what more can one ask for at a price which is extremely budget friendly. During sale price with discounts n 1yr screen replacement  etc made it for the best across price ranges.

Pretty bad after usage of over a month.
1. The connectivity sucks. 2. Wakeup has already become slow. There is now noticeable delay for camera start.3. picture quality is not really great to talk of 48mp 4. lots of software issues already seen..4. calling/phone functions sucks, it rings but screen does not come up, even u accept call, it still keeps ringing.
only thing is battery is decent.. i intend to return it

Great product. Could have provided something else than plastic body(which has truely become outdated). Would have preferred a Qualcomm processor. If u want it for brand, service and after sales value, go for it. If not, Xiaomi and Realme is what u go for. Camera is also good(best thing it has compatibility to store images in HEIF format also, which is better than JPG in terms of both quality and image size). Battery is the real selling point of this phone(can't argue about it). Display super AMOLED(just wow).

Basically this phone much more better than those of chinese MI, Vivo, Oppo, handset company.
Battery is Massive 6000 mAH gives me 2 days battery back up with moderate usage.
Screen Is Amo-LED
Both sim are volte support.
I am happy that samsung again comes to the battle field to become NO1 in india.

I prefered Samsung over other phones with this phone under same price range with better features.

The fingerprint reader is a smooth functional option its feel never ever
Photos r very clear n slowmotion option is very nice thing its lenses are very accuracy to works better feel
In brand companies never to face the large capacity to test the batteries its an fine one of the manufacturer side
I buy a new handset to replace the old one on that time i search on the trial of Amazon prime that see the first set i like the samsung m30s its not a priceworthy an absolutely real one for me

Amazing experience !! I got this mobile just for 11500 INR with 1000 Amazon cashback and along with SBI card 10% instant discount.

First thing I would like to mention is about the battery. It's a whooping 6000MAh. It's been 4 days after the full charge and still i have a descent battery backup with minimum phone calls and medium Whatsapp usage. Decide looks premium in hand and especially the AMOLED screen stands out.

Amazing purchase for this price point. Undoubtful descent performer !!

You will be disappointed after buying this phone. Not worth the money you spend.  This has bad camera and bad UI. The phone gets heated up even when you are on a 2 or 3 min call and while charge or after charge you can use this as a heat press which is additional feature not mentioned in the feature list.

I love samsung one ui os. Then also i love the battery back up. Camera is worst. Build quality is too poor. Network problem also there. That is the reason my battery consumption is more.. even i am in city area and networks are actually too good here. But this phone can't catch more network. Not recommended.

Samsung M30, is a good phone and the specs also good in this price range. Touch screen is superb, sound is loud and crystal clear, camera is Ok not best one, battery life impressive, Overall i would give 4.0 rating out of 5.0 Should purchase this phone and value for money package. Amazon delivery is also brilliant.

Perfection at all level...... amazing batery backup it has been day 4 since last charge and still 34 % left with medium usage.

The performance of the processor trumps all SD processors in this price range and the camera and the implementation of the super steady mode is just spot on. Produces gimbal like video quality in super steady mode.

The only letdown is there is no TPU case provided and clearly there is provision in the box to include one. Else this is the perfect phone under 20k.

To sum up... A must buy phone with all the latest configuration and in a totally reasonable price

Samsung M30s looking wise good color shades is good battery also good but performance wise it's ok because I  started using this phone 2 days before only and when I played game its automatically came out of the while i am playing so in this manner i disappointed but that is happen only once cameras also comes under not bad category overall performance wise I will give 3 star for this phone

It is a marketing strategy to fool the people, both the camera is not good, i was using Mi from last 5 years so switched to Samsung with high expectation but i got disappointed with this model. Battery is good but it take 4 to 5 hours to get full charge. Display is good, network issue will occur time and again, over all its not worth for money. Think before you buy.

This is my first Samsung phone. Initially until the M series got released I was recommending everyone not to buy a Samsung mobile. Most of it knows why. I bought this phone on the first day of its launch on Amazon and the delivery was fast and some how I had a gut feeling that this phone would be great. In my view it's the best budget phone until now which I had purchased.

Pros:
Battery life
Display
Camera
Performance

Cons:
Not yet

As Samsung calls it ..
Really it's a #monster
Battery life is crazy af...
Gaming experience with game booster is epic. You wont get a better PUBG experience in this price range ..
BEST display and blue light filter is like icing on the cake for it..
Fast charger is great.
Last but not the least the 48MP camera is quite good. Love the night mode and depth sensor..selfie camera is nice too.

A true #MADEININDIA product for every class of Indians
Great work Samsung ✌

Value for money, I got it for Rs.11.4K including discount and cashback.
Price wise I found it very competitive in the product Range.
Comparable with oppo f11 pro and A3
Better display and wide angle pictures are truly awesome.
However, night photos were disappointing.
Battery though claimed to be 6000, I doubt as every day it is demanding charge with bare minimal I.e. normal usage.
Overall I would personally give it a 5 star in this price band.

Nothing to complain about the product. Meet's all the expectations at this price point along with Samsung brand.
Fingerprint sensor woking like a charm.
Camera quality is one of the best in the market in this series.
Touch is working like butter, it's so smoot.
At last but not the least it's 6000Ah monster battery gives easily for one day whatever you do.
Overall this is one of the best android Smartphone I have seen at this price point.

What more anyone can expect from a product (and that too from a #1 mobile manufacturer) within this price range? Camera 10/10, Memory (Internal 128GB AND additional slot for further expansion of 512GB), RAM 6GB, SAmoled display and a Monster 6K MAH battery. Seriously, I can't expect more than this in 17K. I bought my phone in 13400/- under exchange of 3 years old Coolpad Note 5 . Also got a discount of 1.5K on ICICI card. Obviously a satisfied Amazon customer :)

Battery life is the best in this price available in market.. I have installed all of the apps which I used in my previous mobile into this mobile too. Previous one would give me only a day for full recharge, but in this mobile it will take atleast 2 to 3 days for full charge out. Also the camera modes are outstanding. We can switch between 48 MP and 16 MP by changing ratio. Also slow motion video recording and AR Emoji recording is fun. The video stabilization is excellent. Overall 10/10.

Camera quality is very poor. Clicked pictures are pixalarating. Speakers are below average. It is very hard to listen to the conversation sometimes when Speaker mode is active.

Screen is very sensitive. It fell down once and broken in three parts. New screen is very expensive.

Battery is better. It covers whole day &amp; consume only 70% of power once get charged.

The over all experience  is really appreciable. Fingerprint reader -is responding very fast with out any delay.
Camera quality - both rear and front cameras are giving their best pictures accord to their mega pixels.
Battery life - promised battery life can be evidenced.  Even though it's taking a bit more time for charging fully, the battery life of this mobile is at it's best when compared  to other mobiles of this price range

This phone has the monster battery, either you play games, watch movies, use for social purpose,  it's not going to die before 48 hours as per my experience.
The camera quality is not that good but if you compare it with the price, it's good...
Fingerprint reader is fast and works fine...
Phone is slim but heavy because of monster battery.
Buy this phone if you need battery life , good screen and a nice processor...

Finger print reader:  Quick responce, Even Face Recognition works great.
Camera : I could say takes clear images and the wide angle feature is simple awesome for Scenery.
Mobile Color: Opal Black is simple stylish and has a black and right edge with a aqua combination just as a pearl finishing with glossy touch.
Battery life: 6000mah battery lasts more then 1 and half day in one charge or much longer if u dont use location.

Samsung Galaxy m30s is one of the best phone i ever used under a satisfying budget
This phone has monster's battery of 6000mah and all the features are just satisfying your expectations
I used this phone from last few days its working just awesome especially its battery backup which i used for 2.5 days without charging it
But the only thing which i think ,Samsung should be modifying better is its back body ,but all over this phone is just amazing

This is my 1st Samsung phone as i am a Blackberry Family Fan, over the years i used to say what Samsung can do wonders in telecommunication as they are into household electronic manufacturing. But my perception has completely changed within 10 min of using this.

Will be going for Note 10 Soon as i am in Love with this Company.

Really can't explain my thoughts in words, I'm just feeling that I'm using wrost phone every, there are so many bugs inside the phone,  like touch issues, very slow responses, camera is the most defective in this phone, hanging problems, these all problems comes in only one month, I bought two phone M30s, both having the same problem, it was my biggest mistake when I bought this phone, If anyone is interested to buy my phone please contact me 8252525222. I'll just sale it at the cost of half purchased price.

Writing this review after using it for a month now. This is the best phone of my life. After comparing many brands in this price range, i found this fantastic mobile. Its a all rounder phone in terms of brand, quality, latest android version, ram, memory, superb battery, fingerprint sensor and the camera. Just go for it. Its a five star mobile. I will give 6 stars, if samsung launches same phone with same features with 8 gb or 10 gb ram.

And lastly i would like to Thank you samsung for introducing this beautiful beast to us!! We love you Samsung :)

I like this product because it has a huge battery, wonderful camera, and superb quality super amoled display.

I'll use this product from 3rd of October 2019, I have used Samsung Galaxy J 7 pro before this.

I'll miss 3 things in Samsung Galaxy M30s

1st is No secure folder in this device.
2nd is I am not be able to turn of camera shutter sound.
3rd is In this device no amoled display settings like J7 pro.

But overall this device impressed me.

It's an amazing product delivered by Amazon. This Samsung Mobile M30s is made by one of the best mobile manufacturers in this world. I bought second Samsung mobile due to it's beautiful hardware and software. I bought this mobile due to its monster battery and camera. This is an awesome product made by Samsung. Amazon is a platform you don't need to be worried. It's  great plateform and from last more than a year I have not purchased a single item from another seller due to their commitment. Keep it up.

It is Monster mobile. Its battery life is really awesome, i charged my cell after 24hours still my battery was 41%. Samsung UI is amazing and camera quality is also very nice. I clicked these photos at night. It was dark. One pic is clicked with normal flash but another pic was clicked with night mode. I was so shocked with the result. Night mode click is really awesome, it made the photo really bright.

It's a really nice product. Best Super AMOLED Display. (Samsung always have good display).
48 MP camera is really good at this price range compare to other smartphones like redmi, realme, oppo and whatever. It will receive two major update from Samsung i.e Android 10 and Android 11. Not support Samsung Pay its disappointed to me. Otherwise all aspects and features are balanced in this range. Long lasting battery, no lagging, and gradient back look rocks..

Screen color quality is very poor , problem is with color depth in this case amoled display won't work and it is the same problem in all M series mobiles bcoz of its low cost , samsung is known for its screen quality and I have bought with the same expectation,  but now onwards without physically seeing the headset we can't trust . Rest is all good .

At this price range, this smartphone is actually good. A good midrange option from Samsung after a very long time. Battery is really good, camera quality is good even at night. Fingerprint sensor does not work well. Needs desperate improvement. Rest all is good. Satisfied with the performance.

Before buying this phone I was bit sceptical. But when I got it in my hand, the first impression was nice. Battery last long. Phone built is really nice. Handy. Camera is awesome. Really  nice. Fingerprint sensor works smoothly. Apps opens smoothly. There's no lag as off now. Am happy as of now. Swiping between apps also smooth. So all in all, it's a very good phone with the money I have spent. U am loving it. Thanks Samsung  and Amazon.

Why I select Samsung M30s ? According to price and high quality battery backup (6000 mah) in comparison to the other mobile, it is the best. The image quality with 48 mega pixel rear camera, the looks, the colour and the touch screen are superb. So, I select this Samsung M30s and grabbed the opportunity. Opportunities don’t often come along. So, when they do, we have to grab them.

The product delivery was quite good.Ive got the sealed pack.thanks Amazon for that.
Cons:
1.However the charger provided with the box was a 10w one instead of 15W as stated in specification.
2. Network connectivity  is not so strong.Ive difficulty in accessing 4G data on my Jio SIM.previous xiomi handset has a much better reception quality.
Have called Amazon to rectify the shortfall in delivery.Waiting for feed back from their side.
Will provide a detailed review after few days.

The main highlight of the device was its 6000mAh battery. But for some reason, my device is not delivering as per the expectation. I've seen some other reviews that are also facing the same issue.  I'm getting the same battery performance as my 2+ years old 3300mAh Galaxy J7(6). It might be due to some app in the background that is taking up the juice and hopefully could get solved automatically or could be solved in a future software update. Other than that, it is a fantastic device for the price.

Happy with the phone. Regular user of Samsung Phones.

Battery life is too good. Last for 2 days.
Camera quality good in day light. Average in Low light.
SAmoled display is superb. Almost having the quality flagship device display.
No network drop issues found yet. Using since 5 days.
Bought 128gb+6gb Ram version. Very smooth and for gamers a best device for playing any HD game.
Gorilla glass 3 is a bit dissapointment but if you use a good Tempered glass that is fine too.

Samsung has done a great job, Was using MI phones for a long time so wanted to try something different this time and the kind of package these provide in 14k is absolutely amazing. First I was thinking to go for a phone for 10k but I was like if I can get so many facilities in 14k then those 4 k won't be a waste. If u don't play games, use just for pictures, social media and daily use then this is the phone for you. I am not a gamer so i can't tell. But I am very happy

Samsung has really improved, in initial days samsung had a tag of "lagging", but not anymore exynos 9611 is beast one of the monster.
Camera is key feature which is desired by active users and hence shots are clear and perfect.
Battery is humungous in this segment. Relief for users working for most of the hour outside their home.
Samsung one ui is better than before. Really easy and comfortable.
Just go for it..highly recommended.
P.s. I got it for 11500rs only.

All over very good phone nice battery backup and very good screen quality but phone little bits hits with multi tasking.
Nice in playing games but slightly lagging in playing.
Very good battery backup with bluetooth, internet always on
Nice camera quality in slow motion, ultra slow motion and hyperlapse but slightly laggy camera.
Plastic back disappointed it gives little scratches so always have back cover nice quality.

It's much better than brands like redmi, Huawei, and real me etc. I know it bcz I was using honor 8x and redmi earlier. It's a value for money product. Camera and face unlock is average otherwise every other thing is best in class. The best part is screen, and samsung UI which makes using phone fun. It has so many options of customization that one can make his/her phone unique and easy to use. I am satisfied with product and urge Samsung to bring more of such products that do not cost a fortune.

It's an awesome product. Such good specifications at such a price range would be difficult to match by any brand. 6000 mah last for two easily. Its difficult to find fault with this product. Way to Samsung.
Suggestions: please start providing suitable headphones along with it. Secondly charger cord length should be little more.
On the whole an awesome product. Samsung must be applauded for it. Thanks

Magnificent phone within this range. A little improvement is required in fingerprint sensor but camera and battery quality is simply amazing. I am using this phone for last 4 months without any trouble. I must say I was bit reluctant to take Samsung phone as my price range was not high and samsung is best is higher range phones. I was more going for other brands but somehow I took a chance and it proved to be worth. The whole phone built quality is very good.

Reviewing after using 15 days:
.Amazing Super Amoled Display with FHD streaming
.Front 48 MP camera is good but it would have better in quality.
.Selfie cam 16 MP is quite impressive. I would  like to tell you that It’s great thing when you will capture videos in slow motion or super slow motion.
Superb battery : 6000mah that is why it is a  pretty monstar.
No lag...Thanks Samsung for launching a superb pretty monster under the budge.

The Samsung Galaxy M30s has a beautiful large display which is full HD. The tall aspect ratio of the phone makes it feel very comfortable in the hand. ... The phone is also paired with a humongous 6000 mAh battery which would last the user for a full day with heavy usage.

The large screen makes the streaming experience a delightful one. We watched a couple of series on Galaxy M30s and we were satisfied with the display performance. I can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.

Did lot of research before short listing Samsung M30s. Was planning on buying  Oneplus 7..
Camera is good.. battery is awesome as the phone promises.. after a busy day with phone playing a few games, lots of pictures,  app downloads etc. 54% battery at 8:30 PM.
Took 6GB ram and inbuilt 128 GB space..
Happy with the decision.

Samsung M30s is a very good phone,
Pros:-
1) Big battery
2) Sleek and premium design
3) Super Amoled display

Cons:-
1) No Notification light.
2) Camera quality can be improved little bit.
3) Should give atleast 20-25W fast charging as battery is 6000mah despite it has 15w fast charging still it takes approx 2 hours 40 minutes from 0 to 100%.

REST everything is nice will recommend can go for it for sure.
Samsung design and one ui is also nice.

I bought the phone out of expectation but it turned out to be better than expected. Like the feature specially the camera and screen size. Battery life retains till 24 hrs. I have not come across any issues yet except the fact that the box did not contain headphones. Camera quality is outstanding for close subjects and on par with previous iPhone series but zooming level is poor. Overall a great phone at a affordable range of 14000 rs. Satisfactory!

Pros_ Biometric (fingerprint and face) is superfast, no doubt. Processor is buttery smooth for day to day task. Even in gaming it well handle.
Amoled screen of Samsung don't have any word. And battery is superb at last 2 days. 15w charging is decent. Feels like feather while holding in hand.
Samsung is trust worthy brand.
Cons_ Plastic body, which is light because of big battery to maintain the balance of phone.
Camera need to improve  specially  front camera hope with next update.

Battery life-great
Fingerprint - okey
Camera-great
Display - great
Overall the phone is very good at this price but, there is one problem that is phone's back body it is not a metal body it have plastic or silicone body. Actually it is not a problem you just need a good back cover for its protection. And hence your phone is ready to boost you!

The best thing is its weight and design! Having a very light weight and very good body design. And also very comfortable to hold!

First of all, the phone is well balanced with weight, amazingly loud speaker, good battery life, pretty good camera and user friendly inbuilt application settings. The finger print sensor is a little slow, just by milliseconds when compared to few other phones, but that doesn't affect the performance All the expectations of mine are met by this phone and every penny paid is valued. Lastly, my phone proved to be lucky to me, hence i dont have any complaints.

In normal lighting the rear camera does have a hard time focusing and defining the edges in the bokeh mode. Pictures lack a bit in sharpness but keep its natural colours.
Images in low light do end up having some noise even in night mode.

Coming to the video..
The videos will end up with noise in low light but the super steady mode is pretty good
On continous 4g mobile data usage with adaptive brightness the battery will last you for abt 1.5 days ( exluding 6-7 hrs of sleep).

Pros:
1. Massive 6000mah battery.
2. Super amoled screen
3. Dolby atmos sound system
4. 48 mp triple rear camera
5. Superb video recording
6. No hybrid sim slot ( 2 sim + memory card)
7. Smooth user interface with exynos chip.
Cons:
1. Front camera not so good
2. Amoled screen cannot resist shock damage.
3. Screen size too large if you are not used to it.
Overall its killer phone except if your only focus is on great camera on both front and rear .

finger print sensor takes little bit time when compared to other brands.face unlocking totally failure option in this mobile.battery and camera quality are the 2 pros which causes for this mobile to remain in the market to compete with other brands.body built quality is not good.samsung aims to defeat the Redmi brand and occupy the drive seat in mobile market not keep the interests of the people.

Super awesome phone...i was never a samsung lover but this phone is really changing my thinking...
Super camera quality....
Battery life is good..last for  nearly1.5 day with full charge and heavy usage..... sound quality is good... was listening to audio while travelling,  sound was nearly like the car audio speakers.
Headphns are not included in the pack and henxe recommended to buy a real good quality headphns to enjoy the sound.
Highly recommended phone within budget.

Camera quality is good, I won't say excellent, but I am happy, pictures are clear. Performance good. I like the phone look and shape too. Battery lasted for 2 full days with normal usage of internet, calls, wifi, bluetooth etc. Worth of Money. Have observed a bit of delay in fingerprint unlock, may be it intelligently takes time to read the prints, but it works in one touch always. After all, I am getting all the required features in a Samsung phone well within my low budget. No reason to be unhappy.

This is my first mobile in Samsung and only 2 months old. I am so disappointed with this mobile.. i bought this on last February.  Now my mobile is shutting down automatically 2 time in a day, when i try to restart again i am getting only SAMSUNG logo.. after 10 or 15 mins it is working.. i got so many call from Samsung that thay asked me to give good review when i bought this mobile.  I am doubting that they gave sample peices and they are testing with me..

The prominent features of this phone which i loved is its monstrous battery and triple camera. The phone charges fast within minutes with the type c cable. The battery lasts very long. The touch is pretty good. Im contented with my phone at such price. I recommend everyone to buy this high featured phone #gomonster

Great cameras. However, swipe typing is poor. Keypad is too cumbersome for people who don't have slender fingers. Absence of option to add guest profiles is a big let down. Speakerphone quality is just about okay. Of course, battery life is good but I hardly found ang difference in my older phone with 5k battery capacity vis-a-vis this phone's 6k capacity. While I miss the stock android experience, overall, it is decent phone with great camera.

After using two-three days,
Camera quality - its average.
Battery life - excellent
Display - HD display Too good
For a normal use, battery will last more than 1.5 days.
Didn't felt any heating issue.
Also its a light weight phone when compared to its monstrous 6000 mah battery.
Also it won't take much time to charge as we are getting a fast charger unit.

Over all its a good phone in the budget range and from a company like Samsung.
Impressed with M30s.
-----
4.0 out of 5 stars

the Samsung m30s has proved to be best in this segment and the look and finish are stunning..
1. The camera is really good.
2. Monster battery lasts long.
3. Display at it's best.
4. User interface Is user friendly.
5. Gives a kind or premium look.

If this is provided with glossy finised panel and in display finger print scanner then this will rule the smart phone segment in this price range...

Not as much good as was advertised and expected. Camera quality is very disappointing. Also battery quality is not meeting 6000 mAH standard. Display is very prone to scratch. SAMSUNG should give honest competition to its rivals as India has blind faith in SAMSUNG.

An awesome product with just spectacular  features, with best camera and just amazing battery backup.Charge it for once and can run it for more than 18-20hours. However, the product lacks a very important feature and that is protection of apps. You can't protect your apps which is a basic feature that is generally available in sub 5K phones. You can ignore this phone only if security is the primary concern for you. Otherwise just go and Buy it

Pros:
Camera quality is very good and I like it's slow motion and night vision mode. It has a monster battery which lasts around 1.5 days for a normal user like me. Samsung produces excellent displays and this super amoled display is right up there. Gaming is also very smooth.
Cons:
1. Front camera is not that good, Vivo provides better front camera.
2. Build quality is very very bad, I dropped this phone only one time by accident and it got lot of scratches in back, so use a back case.

Display- Superb
Battery - Check photo for actuals.. That was with GPS, Torch, Data on, games, browsing. 24 hrs backup for sure with any load. Maximum power save mode gives more battery life.
Performance - Very good
finger Print -- Works well.
Camera- Very good. More of AI colours added to pics. Pic Details is the area of improvement for 48MP cam.
Overall worth buying.

There is no doubt that this one is a best phone in this budget. There are numerous options available to buy with the configuration of 4/64 or 6/128 GB, price wise, battery wise this one is the best phone in mid-range budget. I would suggest buying a phone from a good renowned company in the place of those Chinese firm's devices which start creating the problems for users after a year.

48 mega pixel
6000mAh battery with 15w fast charger
And fingerprint sensor
Just at 13999
Who else can give such an amazing phone at so low cost. This phone is with so many more feature and new exynox 9611 is faster than ever before. Looking towards its weight It seems pretty impossible to believe that it has a 6000mAh of battery.
I'm loving my experience with this phone.
Thank you Samsung for building this phone and thank you Amazon for retailing at so less cost

I love this phone due its battery life. I don't charge my phone daily and it survives whole day. Battery wise, Samsung M30s is amazing!!
Triple camera increased expectations, but not fulfilled. Still the camera is good!
Display and colors need a bit of improvement!
With the range of 17,999, samsung M30s gives fulfills everything  it says and is a budget phone. So to all those who are looking for a phone within 20,000 I would always recommend  this phone.

A very well designed smartphone and came completely upto my expectations.
Extremely satisfied with the device. All features work as described.
Delivery was fast, took only 1 day when it was supposed to reach in 2 days.
Back gradient is amazing too. Camera quality is good but not exceptional. Worth the money. No grievances.
Battery life is really monstrous.

The phone is total value for money, plus points is the amoled screen, battery backup of 6000 mah, simple interface, call recorder and other Samsung utility.  Looks is quite nice.

Drawback, slightly bulky but for 6000 mah battery it is quite light, charging time is slightly higher.

Good competition for Chinese  phone , better to prefer a brand like Samsung which is highly reliable

The phone overall is reallly good....the camera is much better than the usual quality that you expect from Samsung budget models and gaming is smooth(I played COD and PES ).There isn't any case of heating and I've been using it extensively for the past 2 weeks.The battery life too is good but not as big as you expect from a 6000 MAh phone ...
There are some software glitches though during copying and moving files and I guess they might come up with a software update to make things right

If you're looking for a phone to buy then stop right here! Because you've found the best one in the market.
A phone under 15k with an amazing sAMOLED display, terrific battery life, great camera quality, awesome for videography and the list goes on...
The fingerprint reader and face id are highly reliable and extremely quick and so security is not an issue at all.
I ordered the phone a few days ago and I'm awed by its performance! It's a great buy and think no more, order it right now!

Lookwise it is good but found little heay on hands maybe because of battery. The rest features wise it is good. Fingerprints are smooth, display is awesome and the battery life is really something that i have loved alot. Forget about looking for charger all time. Chargr once and be reat assured for 2 days at least to hunt for charger.  Price is also economic not as the previous ones in the market so good buy for me and overall very satisfied and have suggested few other peoples to go for it.

But the battery life of 6000 mah doesn't fell great it needs an optimization, edges while taking portrait mode doesn't feel great maybe a software update can fix  both the issue.

Best device at this price with Samsung branding

Amazing battery of phone I use it as my second phone and due to low battery it has never switch off till date.  Excellent camera and all other features it has most of features which I have in note 10.
It's worth a deal at this price band. With the brand like Samsung it reassures it's the best phone in this segment. I have avoided all Chinese manufucture phones  in comparison to this phone. Highly recommended

amoled screen is brilliant, screen quality is super duper awsum. battery last for almost 2 days . samsung one UI is excellent. BUT the camera quality is not up to the mark. if you compare this camera with redmi note 7 pro then camera quality is very poor but if someone switching from some other phone then it is comparatively good.
charging speed is good wrt its massive battery. overall a very good phone if someone has a budget of 14-16k then this phone is excellent

Bad quality. Review after buying two
1- build quality is cheap
2-15w charger is not enough for such battery
3-front glass will easily broke
4-charging stopped after 15 days of purchase, service center taken 650rs to repair.

Otherwise phone is loaded with features. Camera and battery is superb.

The phone is a stellar deal at the price it is selling. The battery life is insanely good. The cameras won't disappoint. There's something about the display. It just feels smooth and of course being an AMOLED, performs excellently. Media consumption experience is great, thanks to the display and the battery capacity. One UI is REALLY intuitive. Overall, a must have package.

The over all phone is good the battery last the whole day even after very rigorous usage. The 48 megapixel  back camera is really good. There is no heating issue. But are some issues with the software though, it's little buggy. Also the portrait/live focus mode is not very good. I used MI A1 before and it had a far better portrait mode than this. With the huge battery comes huge charging time, it takes around 3hrs to get completely charged also it makes the phone little bulky.

I purchased this phone on 02nd October 2019 and am happy to say that this phone is working excellently.
--》Camera/picture is awesome.
--》Battery life is too long even I used to watch movie whole day but battery remains for long time compare to my previous costly phones.
--》picture quality is very nice. This phone picture quality gives tough competition to iPhone 8/9 camera.
--》value for money as this phone have all features which most of the costlier phones are having.

After using the phone for 3 months I am not satisfied mane problems are there main is hanging often at the time of using any application, it is having 6 GB RAM but very slow. The camera is also not good as pictures are not bright. Overall it is a poor phone. Highly satisfied with Amazon services

Camera quality is just not up to the mark. It struggles to auto focus when you go closer to the object and you start to get blurred images.
Fast charging ain't fast enough.  Its slower than Bangalore traffic.

The phone has security patch from August. Being a hot selling phone Samsung should have bothered to release new updates. They should understand that corporate emails don't work if there aren't any security updates.

Best phone by samsung a big trusted brand. Flagship type features in budget segment is Awesome. Camera, battery, display , performance &amp; One UI optimisation Everything is best. I would suggest to all buyers don't go with Chinese brand as they are cheap quality &amp; their after sale service is very bad. Boycott Chinese brand &amp; give preference to brands like samsung coz they produce high quality products &amp; very good after sale service.Got this 6gb Ram + 128gb variant @ under 15k Love Samsung !!!

Polycarbonate Build quality is poor and Fingerprint reader isn't the fastest in the segment, camera gets the work done. Battery life is above satisfactory but lack of 25W fast charging takes forever to charge mammoth 6000mAh battery. And the battery doesn't really fast charge when the phone is in use or with the display is on. Phone has to be idle to be able to fast charge.

Overall a very solid package and a strong competitor to Chinese phones.

Happy with the purchase!

I have purchased this phone for long bettry life but it is very disappointing.  Bettry is not giving power back up. If it is 100% changed, it will give only 4 hrs bettry back up. Bettry is decreasing even in standby mode. Bad experience.

I've been using this phone for the past 12 days and my experience so far is beyond my expectations. This phone's battery life is just super outstanding with great super amolded touch and fast responsive user interface. Buy this phone without wasting time on other devices. This is definitely a game changer here now. Grab one this festive season.

Amazing battery life, this is want I was looking for once I charge it 100% then I don't have to worry about for at least  2 days and I use a lot of apps and listen to audio and video songs during this period.
Fantastic camera quality, recently was on a trip to Shanghai and shot some photos, the pictures came unbelievable. Fingerprint reader is as good as other Samsung phones. I just love this phone. 6 GB Ram makes enjoyable experience while playing online games. M30s is my new love.💗

My selfies look like "Why do I look like totally different person?!?!?!!" or I have changed a lot after I bought this mobile??!?!?!
Camera is marketed as 48MP please show me Samsung, I see 12 photos where are those remaining pixels? May be please come with a Scientific excuse.
Battery I own 5000mAh mobile earlier. Didn't find this any better than that average battery life.
Pathetic User experience.

Came to know by the packing of the delivery
Please take care of this Amazon.!!
Dropping the prices simply doesn't mean that delivering used products!!.
Phone performance is good but coming to the battery ..!!Its taking a long time to charge example 1 hour to charge till 15%
..by this I feel whether there's a problem in the mobile or the cable has been replaced by the customers!!!

We received phone which had flickering camera...all pics were blurred out...it definitely spoiled the joy of having 48 megapixel camera. Battery life is not at par what a 6000mah phone must have. Amazon electronics purchases are hard to handle in case u receive faulty items..lesson learned always buy mobiles from stores ... Big fan of amazon ...last mobile purchase of google nexus was happiness,this time i had different experience.

It fulfilled all my basic phone needs , battery 6000mah, I charge 3 to 4 times a week. Sometimes I even forget that I have to charge this phone ;-) . Camera is good and  a decent one for this budget . I  bought  the 128/6GB  variant .I have lodded the phone with more that hundreds of apps  , i never saw the phone slowing down till date , I am writing this review after using the phone for 2 months . Samsung 5 stars for you from my side.

If you are thinking to purchase this device - please read this carefully
Device is not connecting via bluetooth to any hearing device of other brand (particularly of Sony, I have 2 types of ear phone - WI-C300 and WI-c400 which I have purchased from Amazon only, receipt and history available)
When I called Amazon customer care- they told it is compatibility issue so they cant take return or replace. It means my both high valued earphones are useless. Think twice before purchasing this phone

I purchased Samsung Galaxy M30s in Amazon Great Indian sale and I also got 10% discount paying online by sbi debit card and bought an outstanding product.

6000mAh battery,  48 MP Camera , 6 GB RAM, 128 GB Internal storage , 6.4 inch display and finger print sensor really makes this device monster (M)  and giving best performance under very reasonable price...I really love this device ...

 Many Many Thanks to Amazon and Samsung...For resolving my problem..

Coming from using Moto G5s+ I was hoping to have as easy handling of two SIMs, but I have ended up clicking more than less, maybe I have not found the correct option yet, but a good phone, value for money.  I found the fingerprint sensor not as sensitive, have to press at times.  Battery last two days for my usage.  I miss cameras that show life as it is without processing, processing should ideally be done afterwards not on the original

Well this is honest review after 5 days usage. Battery is good which long last upto 1.5 days after heavy usage. For gaming purpose ph is awesome. Pubg runs on high specification. Screen is awesome. For those who are saying camera is worst I would like to say him please change settings and then click the pics. After all nice product from Samsung in this range.

Also camera picture quality like any other 8 or 12 megapixel phone camera. 🤧🥵😪

Excellant mobile fhon  &amp; case,everything is perfect!!! Good Fast charging
Perfect cutouts for all ports,camera,fingerprint sensor.
Looks premium, armoured and stylish.
Dosen't feel bulky to me even with the ring stand.
I hope that ring stand would last long initially it feels sturdy.
Initially I was not expecting that much because the images provided seemed unrealistic . Nice look nice quality
But now I'm very happy of this product and its genuinity.

Brought Samsung M30S and posting this review after using 10 days. Yes, this is a wonderful mobile in terms of RAM and storage but still its hanging for some seconds and if is it the situation in the beginning then we can easily assume what will be happen when memory going filled. Fingerprint senser is so so slow samsung has lots of scope to improve. Also 48mp camera is not upto the mark.. but is it a wonderful in the budget.

Satisfied with battery backup

Battery is defective.
Contrary to tall claims about the  battery lasting 29 hours for video play,49 hours for voice calls and 131 hours for music... The battery lasts hardly for few hours even on standby mode.

On that your customers care service is extremely disappointing. I repeatedly sent my request to replace this Phone with faulty battery but no-one is listening at your customers care services.

I won't recommend anyone to purchase phone from Amazon online.

I gifted this phone to my mom and she was really very happy getting this phone which has fulfilled her need of having phone with basic features and good camera, nice storage and best battery life as she has to go on meetings in various villages every day and feel short in making call back to us as battery runs out.
But now this phone has sorted this problem!
Thanks. 👍

1.Finger print reader - it's really fast when compare to other mobiles which is present in this spec.
2 camera - rear camera is really superb. Only thing is to improve front camera for selfie lovers.except that it's good.
3.batery life - No words to say because it is having giant battery. I working in mobile network I use continuous DATA and hotspot as well as phone calls too.finally I have 30% battery more in a day. Before this I put charge twice or thrice a day.

I just loved the battery life of the mobile. Without mobile data it supported 48hrs of battery life with minimum 12hrs of music and movies both the days. With mobile data on continuously and all other activities it supports 24-30hrs of battery life. Camera is also very good and no hanging at all.

The bizarre thing is the yellow tint of the phone is not vanishing even after all settings(vivid, bluelight filters) are modified.  Please don't buy if you hate the tint.

No silicone back cover was there in the box. Had it not been mentioned as part of the package, I'd have ordered it simultaneously. Very bad on Samsung's &amp; Amazon's part. The back cover box only contained manuals. No back cover was there as mentioned in description &amp; shown in the unboxing video. Felt cheated.

Wow phone with this price tag. Nearly all updated version you can see in this phone. Processing speed is amazing. Battery is simply wow. It can stay surely for couple of days, this may even extend with battery saving setups. Finger print may lag sometimes that you have to touch again. Camera quality does the great. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery. Back covers and screen protection are not so much available in markets presently. You need to wait.

Samsung Galaxy M30s is gud product..
Like camera, battery, features,  everything is gud..
I used SBI debit card so, I got 10% discount for the product..

If you are planning to buy this phone just for battery please stay away other 5000 mah phones perform much better. I was expecting at least 2 days of usage which I was easily getting with my previous 3300mah phone. It is lasting only 1 day. Satisfied with all other features like display camera performance but not with battery. 5000mah realme 5 is giving far better battery performance when compared to this.

Fingerprint reader is pretty fast and even the face unlock was fast.
Camera quality is better than the many smartphones out there in this price, Night mode is also good the pictures taken in Night mode has got some good lighting.
The battery was really monstrous, the 6000mah battery in this phone is amazing and it also got a 15w fast charger which charges up fast but not as fast as many smartphones because of it high capacity battery.

Overhyped.  Battery life is same as my Samsung S9+.  It takes two times more than S9 to charge.  The camera wide angle is great but picture quality is less than that of Samsung S9+.  The phone screen is not sensitive to touch.  Why is so much press publicity for an average phone.  can't expect more than this for RS 17000.

At this price range this phone is totally value for money. And amazon i have to say that what a service too good i was totally satisfy...

Feature rich phone at this price range, built and finish is okay, good quality screen, good camera, good battery, I got 24 to 30 hours of backup on normal usage, basic accessories like headphones and cover - screen guard are missing, though its due to cost cutting but company should have provide basic accessories. Overall good deal, better than MI, Oppo etc. at this price.

Its look is ok ok.
Camera is fine ,it's resolution is awesome,it's slowmo video is super.
It is true it's a millionaire user mobile .
If it will not hang in future then it is one of the best phone between the youth and till now it is not disturbing me last 20 days .
And the last thing it is lucky for me.

Has the feel of a 7k-8k phone. Camera seems very over rated by Samsung. Call audio is not loud enough.

I went with the brand assuming an 'always good' quality. But now I would say Redmi Note 7 Pro would have been a better option.

Performance and battery life are good.I am not a gamer but I play PES 2019 which is running very smoothly at standard settings.Camera needs improvements which is not big deal  as it can be done by Software update.Super slowmo,hyperlapse are fun to use.Build is not that great but who cares as we are definitely going to use a back case no matter how beautiful our phone looks. Display is great.Fingerprint reader and face unlock are bit slow,hope they rectify this by coming updates.Overall a great package✌✌

You can buy this phone if your requirements are
1. Good Battery life.
2. Crisp display (amoled)
3. Camera okayish.
4. Don't like ads like in Miui(Xiaomi).
5. Bored of black color design.
6. Planing to use it for another 1.5 to 2 years.

You cannot buy this phone if your requirements are:
1. Very good camera. (for selfies)
2. Need 128 GB internal memory as because your don't care to reqularly take backup.

Battery backup is really good, it charges very quickly.
Camera quality is fine.
Fingerprint sensor sometimes feels little slow but nothing to complain on other sensors and works aptly.
Apps switching is smooth, loads quickly.
Only concern is - phone gets little heated up while playing games.

samsung galaxy m30s is best phone under ₹14000/-, battery backup is great,One UI is superb and user friendly android based os, display quality is also great. apart from this I think instead of polycarbonate back panel samsung galaxy m30s should give corning gorilla glass back panel. sometimes finger print reader can not read quickly as normal even fingers surface is clean so samsung should improve a fingerprint reader in galaxy m30s. overall samsung did important improvement in the M30s

No words to describe the uniqueness of this phone. I got everything in this phone which i was waited to buy the best one since more than 9-10months. This phone is worth waiting. Those who got double mind towards buying this phone, trust me, get one. You won't regret.  The touch and the camera, the battery and especially there are few features which i never heard of but i found them really very useful for me. Thank you Samsung for creating such an amazing smart phone.

Battery is the best in this phone, coz today the only thing matter in smart phone is bettery backup, usually I charge once in couple of days.
Wish it could have a better camera like A series phones, but none other the less it is the best phone in mid range till date.
Great Samsung 👍🏻keep it up

2.Performance is better than any other Samsung device in this price and also better than devices from other brand at this price
Dislike:-
1.the looks are not up to the mark,it feels a bit cheap, they should have provided glass back.

This is not a dislike point for me because I am a outdoor camera user so for me the camera performance is decent.

Samsung is cheating with all its customers, the camera of this phone is not good, the charging system of this phone is also not fast and this phone does not even have a 6000 MH battery.

A big step moving on to a 6000mah battery from a 4000mah battery, but the level of satisfaction is huge. Uninterrupted use for over 1.5 days and not a Problem. Calling, Sound everything is very good. I don't Play games so I cannot say about the Heating Part. Coming to the Camera Quality , it remains true to its quality of 48 MP and especially the Night mode shots will add on to the Satisfaction. The Front camera is also a High Quality One. Smooth Operation is what I will say about this Phone.

I liked this phone for following things :-
Display is gorgeous.
Phone is really compact and light weight considering its 6000 mah battery.
Always on display feature is also cool.
Dolby atmos feature is worthy.

I disliked this phone for following things :-
Battery doesn't performing like 6000 mah only 1 day back up.
Camera is also good on paper, pic is good until you zoom it.
Plastic back cover is really gives cheap feel
No back cover provided

All the things like camera, battery, fast charging, gorgeous screen, 48 MP Camera, slo-mo, 4K video recording work as advertised. However, due to use of cheap plastic back, the fingerprint sensor woobles a bit... Also, the sound quality could have been better from loudspeaker. The call quality is however fine, and earpiece is loud enough. Also there are features from Samsung premium phones like Always on display, Lift phone to wake screen, etc.

"Finger print reader" performs well then the "Camera" quality is not bad but in low light conditions looks horrible and the 48MP is not a believable one and "Battery life" is very good... Some times the mobile getting high temperature(Over Heat)

This phone is another master stroke of Samsung in this price range with advanced features like software,screen size,finger sensor,48 MP camera and whopping battery life of 6k Mah...I bought M30s of 6GB and 128 Ram pearl white phone and fully satisfied with the phone....Premium look and quality at it's best.. Though everything is good but camera shots in night are not up to the level as I feel...otherwise phone is superb,premium looks and battery last long for 1 and half day atleast...

I bought the Sapphire Blue 6GB RAM 128GB internal phone. Battery backup of the phone is extraordinarily awesome. The screen is also smooth. Never used a Samsung  before. Seem to be loving it. Front camera is good. But I should highlight the extra slow motion feature, also the low light photography that is super on the phone. I take a lot of pictures and videos for my Instagram and I have a phone that can do it all with good clarity, on a budget and good battery backup

By far the Best product of Samsung
You don't need a go pro to capture wide angle images. This provides the best result.
Battery life is fantastic. Got the phone day before yesterday charged fully and the phone is still going strong.
Display is amazing.
At 6000 Mah battery the weight of the phone is just perfect.
6 GB RAM 128 GB ROM with this price is a cracking deal.
I recommend this phone to every body who loves photography on the phone.

1.Massive Battery in this power phone. It's a tremendous utility for power users like me, who doesn't need to carry power bank all the time.  2 Beautiful architecture in weight Management done by Samsung team. You hardly feel the eight of holding the phone of 6000mah Battery phone.  3 Camera quality is amazing at this price point category.  4  Fingerprint reader is quite swift compared to other phone.  OVERALL This Phone is worth buying and best budget phone.

#samusung nailed it... This Monster has 6000mAh battery which lasts 1 and half day with single full charge . It has upgraded processor  Samsung Exynos 9611 which provides better speed and performance for gamers , this device also has 48 mp triple rear camera set up which gives you a best shots 😉 and as all knows it's super amoled display with full HD+ resolution no one can beat that .
Once and all this is the best budget smart phone Currently available in the market.
This is #Monster

The brand new Samsung Galaxy M30s came with a very good features. It has a Fastest fingerprint reader, 48 Megapixel triple camera is awesome, it's really works good in night mode. This mobile Is good for photography lovers. And the 6000Mah battery will give u a 2 days of battery life. That means you can use mobile for 2 days continuously. And I would like to mention about the processor speed also, especially gaming mode was awesome. I really loved it, and it's worth it.

Camera quality is not good as earlier samsung products. Its 48 mp but feels like 8 pixels. No satisfied with batter if we started using mobile. If there are no apps installed then the battery will lasts longer. My suggestion is dont go with the product. It's not worthable.
-----

Camera quality is worst. Phone is not at all worthy.. just because to undergo competition samsung has released this phone with all low quality hardware in it..one of the worst feature is camera. 48mp camera is no where worthy its not even like 6mpm whenever you zoom the picture all the pixels break.

Samsung has launched an awesome, fantastic, and mind blowing product M30S mobile. It is having everything which I was looking for in my new mobile, except the processor, I was expecting more powerful processor than 96 series. But that is also quite satisfying when I played games like Asphalt, PUBG and Call of Duty on high picture quality. This mobile is well balanced in every manner. Thanks to Samsung. looking forward for more products in mobile and OLED TV's...

Not as expected
Have performance issues
Hang when you try to open multiple apps

Tried to return using Amazon portal
Worst Amazon portal
I ordered only this product from their site in 6 months and when i tried to return from their order detail page
Opened the Amazon call
Waited for 30 minutes and no customer executive accepted the call
When you have so many calls from customer why the hell you don't have sufficient executive
Making people fool

I have been using this phone for around 1 month, it's quite a good smartphone for the price. I really like the camera on this phone both front and back. The pictures are awesome! The phone's battery lasts around 3 days with the usual use.
I have not faced any issues with the phone yet. The only problem i faced sometimes is with the face detection feature but the fingerprint reader works fine always.

Got the phone 1 day prior to its original delivery date..
Overall the phone is very good, initially there was some heating issue but after few hours of starting it was resolved itself..
Camera quality is decent,  not as Samsung said 48 MP.
Display is superb as always by Samsung.
Phone's color could be more premium of this phone,  this combination doesn't look decentas as shown in picture.

The worst smartphone I have ever bought in my life is the one I am currently using Samsung Galaxy M30s.  I have nightmare because of this smartphone. And the customer service  is third grade. They are not all helpful in resolving the issue. Pathetic customer service. Please don't make mistake in buying this phone. Front camera not upto mark. Phone gets heated terrible whenever you use mobile data service. Full charge Battery life for One and half day.

Best thing about this phone is it’s battery that lasts 4-5 days of normal use,
where my I phone Xs max lasts for 1 day it lasts 2 and half to 3 days

Camera is 48 megapixel but very poor like all non apple phones

I love the dynamic screen feature a lot

M30s is a eye catching product as it provides all the features in a nominal range. I was really surprised first and after i bought I'm really satisfied with it. The battery life is amazing and one can use it whole day without even charging , fingerprint reader has also shown an excellent performance as it recognizes very fast , the front camera or selfie camera clicks best quality pictures but the back camera sometimes blurs up the image when we click a picture closely in a flash light.

Finger print reader : it is more helpful without entering other pin, because my nephew know all my passwords  fingerprint lock is most convenient to stop using my mobile for lot of time.  Camera quality : camera  has a best clarity  and more  options especially  slow motion  option is more useful to me.  Battery life : battery is convenient  for longtime usage  but while using net mobile  getting  heated  it's only the problem.

I found it very good but the only problem is some apps consume large space in background. I need to check memory consumption everyday.
Sometimes it takes time to start when we turb on wifi/mobile data..
Face Lock also don't work properly in sunlight which comes from window..

Great phone!
I bought this phone on the launch date, and received it the very next day. Samsung being one of the best brand, provided one of the best phone at this range. The phone is a power house with 6000 mAh battery, new exynos processor and a triple camera setup. The storage capacity is also a lot (128GB). The sAMOLED screen is a cherry on the top.
I would totally recommend this phone to everyone who is looking for a new phone.

Performance, battery, display quality, sound &amp; internet is perfect and feels worthy to thr cost!
But camera is not for photogenic people it is good enough for normal documenting! The details of picture seems fine when is close up! To know the exact quality, landscape pic will be helpful to know, so the above pic is 48mp picture! It is not much detailed it just looks like 12mp!!! It is good enough for some girls, daady, mom, uncles &amp; and never bother about picture quality at top! ✌️

This phone is really a value for money. Its little bulky but its ok we can handle.(my opinion) my previous phone was Samsung Galaxy Note. Its screen got break so for time being I need a phone that is capable for my needs so I found this one. As I said it's really value money.
Performance is unbeatable, camera is awesome battery life is great. What I found discomfort is the plastic body of the back side . Overall I really recommend

This phone is having amazing battery life with 48 mp camera quality which is absolutely incredible.
Moreover 6GB ram is providing seamless operation of phone
Samsung can consider upgrading its user interface and provide inbuilt  music player. Rest all are excellent.
Finally YES for this phone I got it in exchange of my old mi phone with exciting offers of icici bank.
In all great deal and chance to experience latest product from world major samsung.

I was pleasantly surprised by how light the phone was despite the claims of housing a 6000 mA battery. Astounding battery life, Great shooting capabilities, Smooth performance, Immersive Super AMOLED display, Night mode isn’t the best, Selfie shooter could’ve been better, It could be better in next updates.

Ultimate battery backup......with average usage you get up to a day and a half

Will not comment on the camera as am not a camera aficionado..but its decent enough and serves the purpose of clicking good photographs...

128gb more than serves the purpose..in built VPN is another beauty..

128gb is the one to go for..must buy if you are looking  for a phone with adequate storage and performance...

Everything is nearly PERFECT in this phone. But after using it for about 1 week now, I found 1 problem that is when you take an image with 48MP Camera it takes like 2-3 Seconds to save that picture and hence allowing you to take the next image. I really look forward for the upcoming updates to fix that. Well except for that issue there are no problems with camera, and really take great photos with punchy and bright colors. This phone is definitely worth it. Good Luck and Take care Guys

The phone overall is a worth it phone. Good storage, good camera and nice protective features. The only down size is the phone weight which is a bit heavy! I ordered the blue colour variant and it did not displease. The ram speed is good and the switching from app to app is also smooth. A recommended buy from samsung.

I'm using it for 20 days and I must say, best smart phone in this price segment. If I talk about the camera it's superb in day light photography if I talk about battery unbelievable but sometimes its fingerprint sensor struggles but what I'm getting in this price point from processor performance to camera to battery to the super amoled screen to everything which a normal user wants, it's the best option.
Don't buy Chinese crap just go for it.

Amazing battery of 6000mAh and v.beautiful screen , unlike other brand phones, Samsung M30s screen is really nice,v.nice to watch movies of 4k resolution and phone is pretty fast.
Battery - 10/10
Display - 9.5/10
Speed - 9/10
Charger(type C)
Suggestion to buyers - Go for Blue or white samsung m30s as blue &amp; white is v.elegant compared to black.

First impression display it is best mobile to my usage thank you Samsung need more improvements  on budget mobiles.Mobile battery life is good and runs throughout the day,the display is so good while watching videos the colours are too good,fingerprint sensor is good at the backside,camera is good effective photos you can take with m30s not doubt,so overall at this price range it is abudget mobile from Samsung.

Fingerprint reader is satisfying and fast enough but i think it could get more faster than this . Camera quality is very good when used with selective modes according to scene and requirements. Battery life is unbeliveable it lasts for 2 days for me on a single 100% charge while using the phone with data,surfing social media and works for day to day life . Overall performance is very cool . I would like to suggest this phone to the new buyers thinking to buy this phone .

Gaming experience  is not upto mark. Nothing in other sets of this segment to compare with samsung.. as Samsung is best  .. but this time having some drawbacks  camera quality of Samsung with 48 mp..  was something to listen much perfect. But not this time yaa set is good for daily uses but gaming experience is not upto mark  . But howsoever in 14000 M30sis the best in this segmentwhere each and every thing is balanced with customer's  daily choice

Samsung M30s is a high quality mobile phone with minimum price. The mobile is very user friendly with fine design and fine touching performance. The battery is up to the mark and performs according to the expectation.The camera is of high quality but the operation is not user friendly. Overall it is a good phone and supports the expectation.

+ Pros: Realistic color, Bright display, Lightweight, Built-in speakers
✔ Yes, I recommend this product.

Sound quality and camera quality are the best in this Phone.
Screen size is big, which is good to see movies.
size of the memory is decent enough to hold many photos and videos.

Cons of the phone.

Used for about a month. Except for the night pics, overall performance is on par with flagship phones. Using a back cover will solve the issue of low quality back panel... I could achieve highest achieve screen-on-time of 10hrs 50mins which is by far the highest... with heavy use that could fall up to 9hrs 30mins... Dont believe about low audio quality (speaker)... Its good enough and while using headphones use Dolby atmos facility to enjoy premium sound.

Camera quality also not good takes long time to save photo and can’t haves enough quality based on 48 MP. Battery not working nor then 10 hrs if using Internet and application. I don’t think so it has 6000 mAh battery. The major problem with these set are drop of network. It always drops while using Internet of watching live video.

According to me I am using this mobile but I can’t suggest anyone to purchase it.

Camera was excellent .. first time i found, that i looked good in my selfies...  ( M 30 Smile ).. buy it .. forget it..

3. Earphone slot given at down side which makes difficult to handle phone.
Camera 48.mg Poore quality.

This is a very good product. Processor is good, camera is good and battery performance also good. I have been regularly using it for last more than 15 days and no problem faced till now. I have also used Samsung and other mobiles but performance of Samsung mobiles have always been better than others. Problems faced have always been less and apart from it, after sale service of samsung is the best.

Thanks for the Great Smartphone!
I have been using it for 3 weeks and it's working smooth and good! The camera is wonderful and the clicks are great or better than many other phones that I have used. With its battery, I can use it for 2 days, being casual user. Regarding the fingerprint, it's good but has parts of improvement where the scanning can be done in quicker way and more precisely.
But, to put it in a nut shell, very good phone for this price range!

This smartphone of Samsung is really awesome at this price. All features are good in this phone but camera quality of front camera is not so good images are not so clear . Rear camera is better at day time but at night images are very unnatural and have excess brightness. You should improve your camera for more natural capturing with original natural colours. Besides this all the features are best processing is very fast and battery, the  best part of this smartphone.

The is good for its price range and camera quality is very good and overall it's a satisfactory performance. Only concern is sometimes it hangs or you may say slows down in operations.

You can't expect better than this in this price range. Everything is above expectation. Highlighted things are camera and battery. You will get smoother experience too with one UI. Till I have not got any lag and with upper moderate usage battery gives easily 2 days back up. I have attached some snapshot which will tell how good the camera is. Only con is build quality. The back bone of this phone is really weak. That thing you have to compromise because all other things are too good.

Pros: 1)6000mah massive battery,
  2) Amazing display as it should be because of
  amoled display. Also the touch is super smooth and you can feel it.
  3)The os used by it is just awesome. Simple and easy to use with great flexibility is enabling or disabling features.
  4) face unlock is fast.
Cons: 1)the camera can be slight better than what
  its given. But its good.
  Apart from that no any cons i can see.

Battery not working for me
It came to  30 % at 9.00pm
After below normal use.
I had a full charge at  8.40am

Even my realme 1 gave  me  a day's backup 😒

Thankfully  Amazon replaced my phone
Now it's working well...
Thanks to Amazon...

Great phone, or the smartest one. From the camera quality to the processor or if it's battery life this phone ranks on top in each feature. it comes with the type C charger which appropriately only takes 2.5 hr to full charge and battery last whole day, even if you play PUBG and Call of duty for almost 3-4 hours and all day chatting, and you'll still left some around 35% at night before bed to scroll over some memes. Overall the best budget phone in a long time.

The radio receivers and transmitters within Samsung mobile phones in general, and this one in particular, leave a lot to desired. This one shows omly 2 or 1 bar in signal strength when any other phone shows 4 or 3 bars.  May be Samsung needs to check on their frequency settings for receiver and transmitters built in their phones.

This forced me to do Network Reset twice resulting in my losing the voicemails i had saved,  both times.

Reviewing after 5 days of use....

This is an awesome phone in this price range... S AMOLED screen is super sensitive and gigantic... Camera is average for daylight outdoor photography.. Indoor photo quality is absolutely disappointing.. front camera is of very very poor...
Battery with 6000mAH is monstrous.. on full charge it lasts long atleast for one and half day of heavy usage.. Processer is good and no lagging at all...

Excellent smartphone at this price range. The looks of the smartphone makes you feel premium. I must suggest to go with white colour. Features are mindblowing if you compare this smartphone with other which falls under the same price range. I liked the pop-up feature the most where at the same time i can do multiple task. Although the fingerprint doesn't  have fast response but the face unlock is brilliant works even in low lighting. Go monster.

If you are not interested in gaming or photography then , this is only for you dude😉.... it's awesome but having not got processor that's why ( it is not made for gaming) , it's camera is not so good , it's like average
BUT if you want to use single phone about 3 to 4 years then it's good for you 😊😊
It's amazing features:--
1. Display
2. Battery
3. Dark mode , new style of taking screenshot,e.t.c.
4. 4k recording

The m30s is a true monster
Those who say it's cam clarity is bad are actually fools .you guys should change the resolution to 3:4(48mp) and click pics.
It's battery is all good as it don't drain up to a 25% even after an hour of intense gameplay.
HATSOFF SAMSUNG ,for making such an awesome product

Samsung mobiles have always been my priority because of its world-class services and product quality. The battery in this M30 is large and provides all-day usage. However, people looking for buying this product for the camera may not consider this one as this phone offers you 48MP camera but its output is very low quality and looks like some cheap quality china-copy camera sensor is used, but the overall experience is very good and satisfactory in this price range.

So, i was just playing around with different chargers to see if i can squeeze out faster charging and suddenly i noticed that it shows the unit is fitted with 5830 Mah battery instead of 6000 mah battery. I would like to request everyone person owning this device to download an app called Ampere and check the size of battery installed..
Edit : after digging a bit deeper, i found this. Please be aware of this before buying the phone.

Product is good and same expect from Samsung. I am using Galaxy series from long time and love to use in future.

with My new M30s, I faced sudden restart problem twice in last week(when it was in pocket) and not sure about cause of it. Other than this, Phone is doing good.

This just 3 weeks review and will post again after 2-3 months

Well done Samsung...and also Amazon
A very cool and quick device at such an incredible price point..
With a beast battery, after using this device like hell for 2 days, I can say it has done away with the need to carry any power bank. Processor very quick and responsive Camera quality also quite well.
And last but not the least Samsung brand value is a much sought brand value than other Chinese brands..
Thank you Amazon for such a quick delivery and a lovely device..

This is a moment of great pleasure to me and I am extremely happy to have Samsung M30S. I bought it from Amazon as it was launched. Whenever I shared photos to my friends shot by it ,they never fail to  appreciate it. As everybody knows about its battery power..6000mah battery is a power bank  itself. Its design also increases one's personality when someone have it in its hand. Really it's an excellent product. 👌👌👌👌👌

Very good phone with comfortable net speed, good quality photography, storage sufficient, speed is very good.
Overall the display is having good eye soothing effect.

The finger print sensor is in awkward position, you will be compelled to use only pointing finger or will have to turn upside down for using it.

Samsung has created a good competition by these M series phones. The 6000mAh battery is awesome and performs well. Display is amazing. The Dolby digital headphone output is superb. UI is the smooth. Camera is a bit slow but hope that is solved in the next update.
Overall a excellent choice in budget phone range.

Battery is what really stands out in this phone. It lasts long. Really long. With one full charge and 24 hours of normal usage which includes more than one hour of talk time, the battery is down by only 50%. The usage interface is smooth and I haven't noticed any lag. Even the finger print detection  is fast. I haven't really tried out heavy games so the phone's performance with that level of usage remains to be seen. Overall, this phone is a more than a very good deal for its price.

Don't fall for the  negative reviews. This is best at the price. People following red mi phones but this has bigger advantage. I will write only advantages and cons and feedback

 Advantage
-Amoled display.
-Always on display (I compromised but it's there)
-5000 Mah battery and runs 2 days.
-Fast charging and 15W charger in the box.
-Wide angle camera is awsum.
-No heating no lagging.
-Face unlock is very fast.
-Mainly look is stunning.....
-Very low radiation
-Blue light filter
-Lock screen story and stunning pics.

Cons
-Little slippery in hand but trust me a 99 Rs cover solved it straight away.
-Online availability.(Now in stock)
-No splash proof (as per the other reviews as I am not going to test this anyway?

Feedback

feedback
-People say camera but I find it's too good.
-People say speaker. One in the bottom is loud  and clear enough.
-People compare with Mi but forget that China model with LCD display and 0.9 SAR value. M30 has SAR of 0.43

After Using for 1 week
-All well and amazing.
-Working in Telcos with lost of calls phone still has 30% batt on second day. To add i have played game for 30 min and watched online movie for 3 hrs on Jio cinema along with hectic job schedule.

I just picked up an amazing phone which is Samsung m30 and I'm so happy to make the right decision.
Talking about this phone, this comes with great battery life and I can strem all my favourite songs and play games without worrying that it may go off. The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. My friends take my phone and go on clicking selfies. I already have 400 plus photos in my gallery. The storage capacity is not a worry either, thanks to the 128gb varient.
The display is really very good. Everything so bright and nice. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I'm loving it! :)

Last few months I am using this mobile performance wise not bad, if you download any file you can't find where it saved.Display -ok not full HD,Audio- Low
Speed - you can't play any online games it will be very slow. Earphone -not available.
Cam-Good, Totally it is an average product, you can use for only calls and watching movies, Phone contains fiber body, we have to handle carefully.

A Samsung's new launched M30 Smart phone is very cool because of the Infinity U AMOLED Fhd + Display is looking very nice. 13 MP ultra - wide dual camera &amp; a triple camera setup capture which is clearly so cool with one of the best photography &amp; great selfies. One of best part is that the battery lasts long since it has massive 5000 mAh battery &amp; also 3x Fast Charge. Storage its also an important factor. It has 4GB RAM | 64GB internal memory expandable up to 512GB, it means you have sufficient space where you can downlod videos, movies, songs and data. Next is, it has Dual SIM slots and a dedicated slot for memory card.

Samsung M30 has
Exynos 7904 Processor
1.8 GHz Octa Core Processor &amp; 4GB RAM - multitask gaming, videos, etc.

Very good screen clarity, it looks very neat and appealing, Camera is very good, low light photography is excellent. Fingerprint sensor is fast and it has good speed which helps me switch between apps smoothly. Gaming on this phone is awesome and it doesn't lag while playing games like PUBG and NFS. The 5000mah battery helps me almost never run out of charge . The charger included with the phone charges my phone in a matter of minutes. The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone. I love it

I was lucky enough to get this Amazing device in the very first sale on 7th March and that too my desirable variant ! 😊 The delivery was also fast. Thanks to Amazon ! 👍
The phone is definitely a True Value For Money as it offers great specs along with great features with an attractive price tag. Let me organise my views about this amazing phone  as follows...

LOOKS : 🔎📲👍
The mobile is definitely an eye-catcher due to its Premium finish, Slim body, Bezel less screen and the Double shaded back panel (I got a Gradation Blue Variant for me !)
The volume and power buttons are placed rightly and are easy to access.

CAMERA : 📸 👍
It has 16 MP + 3 MP + 3MP Triple camera which captures Amazing shots !
With 7 different modes, you can choose the best one according to the scene being clicked. There's a button for Wide Angle which instantly widens the scene to be captured. I have attached the shots of the ceiling with and without Wide Angle Mode. Besides, the stickers and beauty modes work superb to get attractive selfie too.

DISPLAY : 📱👍
6.4 inch Super AMOLED display is brilliant and a small U shaped notch adds to the attraction of its infinity display... The touch and interface is super smooth too and the brightness level is very efficient. You don't need to set it to full brightness when you are outside even in the afternoon.

MULTI TASKING : 📚👍
With it's huge 6GB RAM and 128GB Storage, it's very easy to perform as many tasks as you want without any lag. The phone performs flawlessly without any lag or heating. You can activate Pop up window setting and it will make your Multi Tasking lot more easy and interesting too.

BATTERY : 🔋🤔
Battery sure is a huge one, i.e.5000mAh, but I didn't feel it sufficient enough to last for 24 hours even. Maybe, it's due to network issues or maybe I have to watch it again after some more charge cycles.
Though, Fast charging from it's 15 watt charger (type C port) is indeed capable of charging the phone really fast.

EXTRAS : 📝
Besides all those stated above, I would like to add some more bullet points...
👍
🔹The Face recognition works great ! There's a lighting animation around the front camera while it tries to identity your face. Looks nice.
🔹 Fingerprint sensor is quick and responsive. You can activate a setting after which you can scroll down the notification tray by sliding your finger on the Fingerprint sensor only !
🔹 The audio quality of the speaker and the earpiece is good. Though, I felt it a bit low when I recorded my voice on star maker app.
🔹 Has dedicated slots for 2 Sims and 1 Memory card.
🔹 Packed with all the needed sensors.

👎
🔹I found no option of assigning a SIM to a specific contact.
🔹 The back panel is plastic and it's kind of finger print magnet.
🔹 The Do Not Disturb function doesn't mute the phone completely though it says so. Instead, I click on the Speaker icon to mute in notification tray.
🔹 No Gorilla glass protection for the display.
🔹 It's not water resistant.
🔹 It doesn't have an Always On Display.
🔹 No Slow Motion video recording feature.
🔹 Runs on Android 8.1. Don't know when will it get the Pie update.

Overall, I feel it is an Amazing phone in this price and I am very satisfied with it's overall performance. It completely justifies it's price. I would strongly recommend this device to everyone looking for a Superb mobile in a moderate budget. Go for it and Thank me later ! 😊

Bought it in the 1st sale. Using for 3rd day now and what i feel is ..
Elegant  looks.
Display quality is brilliant.
Cameras are lovely. And charging speed is great thanks to inbox 15w charger. For a average regular user having not much  interest  of playing games I would definitely recommend  this. Moreover, design is literally premium and and finally Brand is Samsung 😀

I am giving 1 star for Amazon service and 2 star for this phone camera quality is not better and  I used two days heating problem comes.  If you buy this phone from Amazon then it will not be replaceable and returned because a smart check app made for phone performance checking,  it always shows right in all parameters. In this way you won't be able to replace / return this phone. So I suggest Dont purchase this phone Samsung Galaxy M30 from Amazon if it defective found it won't be replaced

First things first,
The phone is not for everyone. You may be thinking you should get a gaming phone at this price. But it is not.
However, the good news is that there are other good phones in this price range if you are looking for a gaming device and especially looking to buy it for playing PUBG. Trust me, do not buy this phone if you are into gaming.

So, who should buy the device? Any non-gamer user who loves other aspects of the phone such as a display, battery, camera and so on.

Display
The display is the most stunning feature of the Samsung M30. It is vibrant and simply stands out. I compared it with my POCO F1 and found it more vibrant, clear and with a punchy contrast. But that doesn't mean POCO F1 display is bad. At 15K, you are getting one heck of a deal when it comes to the display.

Another thing that I noticed is the great body to screen ration. It almost covers the whole screen.

Processor and RAM
As we said earlier, the processor is not up to mark when it comes to running heavy apps such as games. But for an average user like me and you, who love to do calls, read messages and run the basic application, the phone will be more than enough. It will not go slow while using the available RAM(4GB in my case).

Battery
5000mAh battery is super awesome! It is another selling point for the phone. If you are looking for a big battery then the phone is for you. Also, the processor and OS are optimized for each other which makes the battery last longer.

Camera
I didn't test camera that much. But, it does look nice. You can take nice photos. But the camera does not perform best in low light conditions which is okay for a phone priced at 15K.

OS
I tried Samsung OS for the first time. I found it pretty decent, but not outstanding. You need to navigate multiple times for basic features. But, the good thing is that the UI will help you navigate and you will eventually find the option that you are looking for.

In short
Display: One of the best
Battery: 5000mAh, more than enough for heavy one day use. Can easily last two days for normal users.
Processor + RAM: Great for normal users, not great for gamers.
OS: Decent

Overall rating: 8.5/10

Vishwa Shah M30 - 4+64 It's really amazing,the phone looks great the features are up to the mark .it has got everything which someone would want in a phone, really loved it ...also the picture quality is way too good and the sound effect as well.
The phone is speedy and the battery lasts longer too.
It is also very easy to use and equally easy to carry and handle and looks pretty cool it has got every possible required features and I will highly recommend people to go for this amazingly great phone
Samsung has actually done a great job,thank you!!! Y'all wouldn't regret buying this phone and it is so affordable.

This is the best phone i found at this price range. I just loved it. It is super fast and the screen is just beautiful thanks to the Amoled fhd display. The fast charging charges the phone in no time. More ever the 5000 mah battery is a just incredible at the end of day i have around 30% juice remaining!!!! For a pubg lover like me... All i can say is the phone is very very smooth no lags, no frame drops and the big screen gives the best experience 😍. I also liked the front camera which clicks amazing selfies coming to the back camera its just Lit!! The photos look real and natural colours are preserved as well. All i can say is its a stunning phone worth the price.... Loved it!!!

After two weeks of using found that the camera stopped working.

Camera Issue:
When we click on camera icon blank screen is coming.

Lag issue:
Sometimes on touching on any icon an evident delay is happening.

With all these issues reported given to service center

Things done in service center:
 - Updated OS
 - Replaced camera
Still the issue is not fixed.

Now they told they will replaced the panel and check. Still haven't found any problem. When requested for replacement with all these valid problems not replacing the faulty phone.

Very rude people working for Samsung customer care. Worst experience with that also.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Attached video of those problems. Please refer it... Can attach only one video

New Update:
Finally they have replaced the board and the problem was fixed...

And they gave me 6 months extended warranty.

Though didn't get a device replacement.

It's just the 3rd day and proximity sensor is not working in this device and ear piece is heating up while on call. Phone is slow and not a right choice for 15k. Please consider other brand products this phone is not good for regular usage as well.

I have chosen this product over other mobiles in this price range for below reasons :
1. Big battery(5000mah -others have only 4000mah)
2. Triple card slot(believe me this matters though we tend to ignore this point but for those who use double sim ... we would definitely need to use both sims and one memory chip)
3. Super amoled display (again other mobiles simply don't have it)
4. Fast charging + fast charger in-the- box
5. Wide angle camera- useful for big family photos
6. Samsung trust factor

Now after using our fire two full days below are pros and cons I found :

Pros:
---------
1. Battery - Simply awesome. I first charged it yesterday 9.30 AM (100%). Since I did below tasks throughout yesterday and today and it went to 10% today at 6.44 PM  ( so 1 day &amp; 9 hrs) :
  ▪ Audio calls
  ▪ video calls
  ▪ internet browsing
  ▪ listening to songs (headphone and speaker both)
  ▪ watching movie (Netflix) and YouTube
  ▪ setting up phone( usual setting for a new phone - so basically screen was on)
  ▪ playing games( asphalt 9, dead target,  fruit ninja) - all games ran without single stutter

2. Screen- simply beautiful
Being amoled display it show very deep colours which u won't see in normal fhd lcd/tft displays.

As soon as u will see other mobiles without amoled u will notice the difference.
3. UI is smooth and gestures are nice.
4. Always on display gives our result premium look ( though our drains battery faster)
5. Headphone quality is very nice
6. Call quality is also very nice( the most important feature of any phone but we least bother about it nowadays 😉)
7. Charging time nice for 5000 mah battery- 2.15 hrs &gt;&gt; 10% to 100%)
8. Camera is decent (not the best int this price range)

Cons:

1. Processor works fine though but i felt slight stutters here n there (but fortunately it worked really nice for three games i played as mentioned above)
2. Camera doesn't perform well in low light conditions) [but works great in day light]

Till now i m seriously enjoying using this phone even people in my office are appreciating our thanks to its stunning display.

For me its truly practical phone for my requirement as I m not a serious gamer but i will post  updated review on 18th before its next sale on 19th so that u can decide if this phone is for you or not

Good looking fone nice display asusual from Samsung I loved Samsung phone but now since they start using there exynos processors in there fones there phones have become a crap..till note 2 everything was fine..but after note 2 I bought  j7 2016 it had network issues  then finally I sold it for peanuts..then I didn't buy Samsung for a year I used other brands and was happy with there performance..but as I said I always  liked Samsung Mobile..so I thought to give one more try to newly launched Samsung m30 I bought it on first day sale..but to shock me it had same networks  issues as I had with j7 2016..very slow internet like 2G speed ..so I was sure its again same exynos processor problem..so called the Amazon cor the same they said technician ll visit to check the phone and technician said the same this phone had hardware problems. It's just I know coz of exynos processor..now they are going to replace it with new one but I have no trust that even second replaced phone ll be working well...as it ll have same issue coz of exynos  processor what to do can't get refund..so only can think of I ll have better luck with replaced samsm30..pray for me..speaker quality is cranky worst than an ordinary mobile fone microphone quality is also very poor to the surprise no headphones in the box.. I must admit  display is awesome...

I have purchased Samsung Galaxy M30 through Amazon flash sale on 19th March and received on 20th March. Upon unboxing I noticed that right corner of phone is bulged out. Now waiting for technician to inspect. I also found many people faced similar issues.

I just purchased this model. It has an overheating issue even during browsing and if we play PubG that time it's too much overheated. Battery Draining issue does not seem like 5000 mah battery till evening only 40% battery remaining. In this model Samsung remove Secure Folder option so we can not hide personal data.

Great screen and battery backup Impressed me. Pubg worked well in medium. Camera looked good and all.....the next day,it worked for seconds and the screen died while using it. No external damage. Just went black,and touch was still working. Worse customer service but finally got my refund (replacement wasn't even available) today. It also has a crap processor. It lagged when switching apps. Go for note 7 pro,way better buy than this.

Unboxed the item and tried to play ringtone or any song to check Audio quality. External speaker is not working . Performed Soft reset and Hard reset both. Now the device become abnormal state during booting stage and  is rebooting automatically for more than 30 mins by showing "SAMSUNG GALAXY M30" nothing given over control to move forward...Hold power button on time to control above situation but no use. Is started working like as Un programmed ROBOT.
Not at all expected from SAMSUNG.!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Are you guys are checking\testing products properly before dispatching to the customers ?? (or) for flash sale sake running behind ???? thinking like Let first deliver and make money, later on will respond to the customers if they face any problem with the defective piece. .
Irony is for this product especially, customer will not get an option to select replacement or refund option . You have to be dependent on customer care executive for any further support.You will not come to know the status immediately though executive raised a request for Replacement. It take some time to reflect in the system to update after going through several approvals process. I.e replacement / Refund is not hassle free process.

Worst camera quality. Both front &amp; back cameras are not up to the mark .
"Face recognition" is also slow.
Screen, Look, battery is gud. But picture quality is too bad.

When it comes to Samsung M30, you know you're in a good deal. From the display to the look of it, I love every single bit of it. The blue gradient color is one to look out of for. When it comes to using it, you have a power packed device in your hand. Powered with Android 8.1, it is the latest one in the market making it already a favourite. When it comes to RAM, it handles it all. The camera is pretty impressive and the display is an infinite making it amazing to view at. The battery life on the other hand, is long enough letting you do whatever you want to. Even if the battery is low, it charges up extremely fast enough to enjoy your phone once again. The fast charger is a unique and a must have one. The camera has all the settings of that a professional camera, making it an amazing option to have. I highly recommend this for all students

Samsung galaxy M30 is the lowest priced smart phone with 3 back cameras.It has a 16mp front camera with focus which is seen very less in any smartphone below 18,000 INR M30 also gives a 5000 MaH battery so we get a better battery back up and use the phone all day without any need to charge.Phone comes with a amoled display so the contrast and the characters are really sharp and the screen looks really beautiful.The 6gb ram and 128GB RAM will make your phone run faster than ever you can play any game in your phone so your gaming experience is going to be really good and The phone is really light you wont even feel any weight on your pockets when you roam around and looks of the phone is mind blowing overall Samsung galaxy M30 is a delight to have in your hands If your budget is under 20000 it is your go to phone

After 4months using of this mobiles set, I am writing my this feedback.  Samsung M30 processing is slow, it's finger print senser and face detection features are not upto the mark. Its Battery which is 5000AmH, does not seem powerful battery, it's performance is equal to 2800-3000AmH battery, it get s drained very fast watching videos. If you charge its battery 100% then it comes down 97% within 30 minutes without using the phone.
Camera quality is also not good, there is no sense of rear triple camera.
This is only Brand Tag Samsung but over all quality of this phone is not good. It is not worthwhile to o spend Rs 15000 for this "GHATIYA" mobile.
So if somebody wants to buy M30, don't buy it. Better should go for Redmi note 7 pro/ Honor or Vivo

Loving the m30. Super light and easy to hold thanks to its curved design. Sometimes the screen gets a little cut off at the corners but that's okay. Great customisation. Battery is pretty great. Love that the headphone Jack and the charging point is on the same end and that it has a dedicated slot. Finger print  scanner and face detection is a little dull. Can't lock my phone with finger print like I could on my Moto G5s+. Also the speaker kinda resounds, as though you were in a closed room. Also camera is pretty average, hating the beauty mode. Touch sensitivity can also be a little awkward sometimes in the corners. All in all it's a decent phone, great battery life so for basic users who don't play games sometimes or all the time. It's a great handset to have invested in. However, it suits my basic needs, so I'm all for it.

The mobile is getting struck and it's taking 3 hours for full charge from less than 10% to 100% with 15W fast charger given by them in the box....Then there's no point of fast charging here...In 3 hours any phone wil get fully charged with any charger...Then wats the point here saying fast charger and 3x faster and all...

Pros:-

  Made in India.
  Big battery (5,000 mAh)
  Fast charging support (fast charger is included in the box)
  Type-C charging port
  6.4inches FHD+ Super AMOLED display with infinity-U cut design
  Tripple Slot(Two SIM cards+Memory Card simultaneously)
  Tripple Cameras (13MP+5MP+5MP)
  Front camera 16MP(f/1.9)

Cons:-

  Plastic body instead of metal
  Less powerful processor compare to other phones in same price range
  Design should be improved as device is slippery
  Camera in low light is average compare to other new phones in same price range

Good phone in this budget and trust of Samsung makes it more reliable.

THE WORST PHONE THAT I'VE EVER USED!!
Purchased on : April 2, 2019
Received on : April 4, 2019
I actually brought Samsung Galaxy M30 on March 12 (flash sale)... The phone died in just 6 days... The phone didn't turn on again... I requested a replacement for the product, but it was not in stock... So amazon refunded my money on Amazon Pay... I purchased M30 again (on April 2, 2019)... The phone died again just within 2 days!! The screen turned off automatically while I was using it... I tried to turn it on thinking that this might be an accidental switch off... My phone had a charge around 57%... But when I tried to turn on, nothing happened... I plugged a charger into it, it just showed a circle with a lighting symbol (⚡) in it... The same thing had happened with my first M30... Now I've requested for a refund from amazon... I trusted Samsung a lot... But it BROKE MY TRUST WITHIN BLINKS!!! NEVER BUY A SAMSUNG PHONE!!!

The first thing that noticed while unboxing was the gradant look samsung gave to the phone it was just awesome 😍. The battery is just outstanding 5000mah with normal usage it lasts about 2-3 days. Gamers go for it the super amoled display gives a marvellous experience in gaming. The first phone in market with triple camera in this range it has one depth camera the close up shots are just yoo good and the wide angle camera captures outstanding images. The selfies are just super awesome with great quality. 6.4 inch comes with infinity display just loved it.The phone never had lagging issues the games like pubg ran very smoothly✔
The fingerprint sensor also responds with second or less.samsung always comes with the great picture quality also this time the picture quality i love it the triple cameras are just best to capture life's unforgettable moments.
Just a great piece of advice from your brother in this price range there is no other like Samsung. Just go for it 😍😍😍
The M30 and M series are just killing it great price ,great specs,quality,and the brand Samsung just loved it ✋😍✔"

Received it today.firstly the screen and display is great but the polycarbonate body looks real cheap for this price range.
Checked through the settings and apps.well you will not find any lag for now.I believe thats same for all smart phones at this range.
Guys dont go for this phone if you are camera savvy, its not the right deal. Although its usp is triple rear camera but its not just that good enough.
Wide angle is superb but colour correction and AI control is no atall upto the mark. Note 7 pro, samsung j30 will be ranked way above these model.
Front camera is ok and take decent photos.
there is a pro mode in camera but not much manual option to p;lay with other that iso and exposure control.
Video mode has literally no features.
just point and shoot.
Atleast expected slowmo and time lapse is 15k budget phone.
Battery is good and fast 15w charger was in the package.

I am very disappointed with this phone from Samsung M30. I am using it for more 7 days and here is why I am reviewing bad:
- Phone heats up while playing PUBG;
- Display is not good at all. Mi is no doubt way better.
- Battery is 5000mah as they say but does not work like that. Even in week 1, it died very easily.  Another reason to give 1 is because Frapp, which asked us to buy this product didn’t pay my stipend earlier. They acted as Fraud company.

Best phone to get rid of those Chinese options. Phone is manufactured in India and comes with a trust of brand Samsung. With M series Samsung have overcome it's all time drawback of not giving powerful battery. Camera and sound quality is excellent. Face recognition is quick. Screen is superb, in any light and at any angle. Feel of phone is solid and doesn't give feel of plastic. Gradient back panel looks awesome.

I'll head straight to my likes and dislikes.

Likes:

1. Massive Battery: The back up is really good. For a regular user, easily a day and half's juice.
2. Fast Charging: Takes about 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 10%. Yes 2 hours is a lot but even the battery is large.
3. Camera: Does a good job. I was on a fix after checking Redmi Note 7 Pro's camera samples, but trust me the shots are equally good, and the front camera does a better job than Redmi's.
4. Customization: The UI has gestures, features and better options for accessibility than the previous generations of Samsung.
5. No stutter/ lag: Using it for 3 days now, and faced no lag. Smooth experience when it comes to daily usage (can't say about gaming)
6: Minimal Heating: Very less heating. Some people have complained about heating during calls. I haven't faced any.
7. Call Clarity: The calls, the major purpose a phone serves are crystal clear, infact a better reception and a loud microphone (Note 7 Pro has issues with microphone, its not too

Dislikes:

1. Ads: Like MI, even this phone shows up ads randomly while using any app. Can be reduced, but can't be escaped from.
2. Speaker Loudness: Satisfactory and decent but not very loud.
3. Face recognition is fast, but not very fast. Also doesn't work at certain angles.
4. Loss of detail in ultra wide camera
5. No dark mode (black/ dark background for UI. I personally like it that way)
6. Android Oreo in box, and no clue when Pie will be rolled out. Newer versions of Android tend to provide better functionality.

I think no one checked the product before delivering to customers.. i have purchased it on 26th march and it got delivered on 30th march. I opened it with great excitement and really disappointed as its mic is not working.. if we put our hard earned money to purchase this phone but if u get defect piece how you will feel... i thought of filing a  formal complaint in civil court

This is a good product, but I want to return it because this does not fulfill my important need. I have been using Galaxy series phones because of Samsung Knox, and after getting this product I discovered that this product does not support Knox, so I have no use for this.

But I am surprised that they launch this new series and keep an important feature out? really disappointed.

Doesn't seems to be 5000 mah battery drains very fast,frequent advertisement,mobile is very slow.screen is not protected by gorilla glass 5 or 6 for better screen life.Camera quality also not upto the mark comparing to note 7 pro.One good thing is AMOLED display which looks very premium in hand.

I wanted a budget friendly phone and I was lucky to have found one. Firstly, I was happy that it is a Samsung product which one can rely on. Secondly, it was falling under my budget of 14,990. I can say that I am very thankful for Samsung, for launching such a great phone. This phone has everything that one can ask for , be it good camera, battery, display, processor, be it anything, Samsung M30 fulfills your demand. Personally for me , I am highly impressed with its Battery power, it has 5000mah battery which is amazing. Now a days it is very difficult to get such a great battery life in a phone. It has 4gb RAM , which is one of best feature of this phone as myself being a game addict , i always wished for a phone in which i can enjoy playing games smoothly without lacking and Samsung M30 has made it possible. It has 3 cameras at the Back and one front camera as well which is pretty amazing. It's Infinity U display steals everything, it gives a premium feeling while using the phone. Samsung M30 is the best phone one can ask for. The design of the phone is amazing and I might not switch to some another phone for atleast sometime now.

The Galaxy M30 almost renders the Galaxy M20 redundant. For the extra 2000 bucks, you get an AMOLED screen, better selfies, better connectivity (dual-band Wi-Fi), and a better portrait mode for the rear camera.

When compared to the new and emerging competition like Redmi Note 7 Pro, the Galaxy M30 has its advantages (AMOLED display, HD streaming, software, battery, fast charging) and let downs (performance, primary rear camera, plastic body), but it should still largely bank on the Samsung brand value to win the bout. The Note 7 Pro leads in several key aspects.

If you are not much into high-end gaming, would value display quality over the camera performance, and are restricted by a budget, the Galaxy M30 won’t disappoint. You could also look into stretching your budget a bit for Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50.

*Pros*

Excellent Display

Battery backup

Supports HD streaming

Dedicated card slot

USB Type-C port and fast charging

Not for heavy gaming

The new Samsung M30 has a whole lot of fabulous specifications . To start with , it provides a 6.4 inches of AMOLED display . It has a triple ultra wide camera which adds into its favour as no other phones offer something like this, makes you click amazing photographs which Im sure is a DSLR quality. Also an extra efficient battery of 5000 Mah plus the storing capacity of 128 GB which will help you play all your favourite games, watch high quality videos and you dont even run out of your gallery space. Overall it is the best suited option in the range of phones below 18,000 and you too can make a smart choice like me and get this phone!

Very bad phone guys. i will not reccommend this phone to anyone. I buy this phone for playing pubg n other games but this phone gets so much lag while playing pubg. Very bad performance of the processor.
I request to return the device but amazon didn't return this. They connect my device to their system online and ask me to play pubg. I was playing and phone was lagging so much but their system didn't detect the lagging problem. So they refused to replacr the phone. Then i sell 1 day old device to 13000. Very bad phone.
If you want to buy this for gaming then don't waste your money on this worst processor phone.
If you don't play games then you can buy this. But i will not recommend this to anyone.

Phone is great, battery is not upto the mark, camera quality is pretty good, but the wide angle lens disappointed me. Speakers are outstanding. It takes around 2 hours to fully charge. Phone works smoothly, Highend games miss that touch, If you're a hardcore gamer, I'll recommend  Samsung A50.

The biggest mistake is to buy this phone, This model has a very bad hardware design in the display section. the display is not working and I replaced the item and the second phone which I bought is also not working after 20 days and Amazon says return period is over, now Samsung guys charge 6400 to change the display. (Dear Samsung try to respect the customers and their valuable money don't play trial and error game with us)

I also enquired and found that many phones in Samsung M30 has this issue, this is clearly a trial and error piece from Samsung so that the future upcoming phone they can work on.

Rest of the things like the camera and battery is fine since I am likely to be a tech guy the made a poor design in hardware and it is very unstable.

Thanks for wasting my 18K, amazon should also think before the sell any products which can be purchase only on amazon

Never  ever buy this phone

Disappointing as hell..Its battery is like the same of some cheap budget smartphones ...Imean what should you accept for a whopping 5000 mAH cell...It should last a whole day but man it's bad af..It's the same as 3000 mAH.
Also I don't understand why the internet's soooooo slowwww...???
I meant there isn't a problem with the network myself..there must be something with the bandwidth capacity if there device ...
Total dissatisfactional tech piece..
Even while writing this review. The battery indicator turns 73% to 71%....

Wouldn't recommend to buy. Think twice before buying this mobile.

I am writing this review after using the mobile for more than 20 days. And I regret myself buying this mobile. I had great expectations on this mobile which came from Samsung. But in many aspects it failed to meet the expectations.
I would go with a 3 star for this one.

Cons:
1.  The worst part of the mobile is the touch sensitivity. Touch sensitivity is very poor. Sometimes you need to touch the screen at least thrice or more operate the mobile. No one would really want to have such a kind of issue. Don't really understand why Samsung has manufactured such a bad touch sensor. Don't know how to get this issue fixed :(

2. Samsung claims that this mobile comes with fast charging. Believe me, I haven't seen any such difference. I used 4 mobiles from Redmi series till now which didn't have fast charging facility and M30 takes the same time as Redmi to get charged completely.

3. Despite of having 5,000 mah battery, the backup is not that great but manageable (Almost similar to Redmi series)

4. When someone speaks using this mobile, you feel the vibration of voice from the back side (which in general will be observed in low priced speakers).

5. Finger print sensor is not good. The sensor takes time to recognize the finger print. You might need to touch it twice some times.

This mobile is not worth waiting and investing 15K. I am thinking to sell this off. Think twice before buying this mobile. Will try to update my observations after few more days.

Samsung Galaxy m30 Mobile Phone doesn't have Proximity sensor but the company claims that same is there in it as I had replaced two handset and get checked by Amazon Service Expert and Samsung Service Center but Samsung Service Expert doesn't know about it and no solution has been provided from there end. It's been a manufacturing fault but same is not being resolved by them.

Samsung galaxy M30 is fully packed with all the necessity features which should be covered.The camera qualities are amazing .The phone is ultra light carrying such features.The battery life is amazing. Rear camera and display is going to be my next favorite for atleast next 2 years, talking about the the design it feels pretty amazing,display takes it to next level. The most amazing feature is face unlock i was not sure if the speed will be fast enough but believe me as soon you look at the screen it unlock within like half second and that's pretty impressive, if you're worried about storage well then don't worry because it has dedicated micro SD slot. Yes you heard it right it has a dedicated micro SD slot! So, y'all don't have to worry about storage anymore. The dolby atmos feature for Bluetooth devices and earphones impressed me allot. The phone overall is pretty amazing.I think ill not get better phone than this.

I bought this phone after a lot of consideration one obvious option was redmi note 7 pro.! But finally i made my choice and bought M30 6gb variant and after 3 days of uses i can say it is worth every penny you spend on this device.

Pros:
Display:
You are not going to get this elegant display in this price range except M30

Camera: rear camera quality is good but front camera is excellent

Battery:
It would last easily around 2 days if you are normal user. It get full charged in around 1hrs 40 min

Ram management is excellent. You will get around 108gb free out of 128. Built Quality is excellent and dosen't feel like plastic body. but you must buy a case because if you broke display it will be too expensive due to super Amoled display

Cons:
Android pie update is missing. I hope it will be available soon. Charging cable is too small.

Plus Point: Samsung has done a fabulous job of keeping the 3.5 mm Head phone jack even though they have type c USB for data and chargingThe best thing about Samsung M30 smartphone is its massive battery back up of Li-Po 5000mAh (Non removable) which comes with 15w fast battery charging. So no more waiting to charge your phone and abstaining use of it when out.Moving towards screen. The all mordern looking infinity V cut display is just icing on the cake [Its Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen] with 6.4 inches and a resolution of 2340x1080 (394 PPI). The triple rear cameras (13MP with an f/1.9 + 5MP with an f/2.2 + 5MP with an f/2.2) with ultra wide and depth sensor having LED flash, panorama, HDR features comes in an affordable price tag.The front camera with 16 MP resolution with HDR feature is also great for taking snaps. The 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage blue variant phone comes for 17,990 INR.The OS version of Samsung M30 is Android 8.1 (oreo). The sound quality of this phone in this price is best. The volume and the power button are on the right hand panel, and hybrid-SIM slot which has separate slots for two SIM cards (supporting Volte on both the sim) and a MicroSD card of up to 512GB. The smartphone comes with face unlock, fingerprint (rear mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass sensor. This phone full fills all the demands in such a low price.

The Samsung M30 is a really great budget phone under 15,000.
Also having a super AMOLED display in this segment is like heaven on earth.
The camera quality is good even after zooming, the pictures doesn't lose it's details.
The selfie camera is too amazing and it's much better with the live focus feature.
The gradient look at the back of the phone makes it look much more premium.
The exynos 7 chipset works excellent even when using the 4GB RAM variant
Eg. The face unlock, fingerprint sensor is quite responsive, playing PUBG on HD graphics is also preferable. I love this phone

Samsung M30 has super Amoled U Display, new fast processor 7904, huge battery life which can go for many days with a single charge plus 3X fast charging, provides a good facility of dual sim and dedicated card slot, The Samsung M30 is an amazing Mobile, build quality is soo good, phone is light weight which helps me carry it wherever I want.

Samsung Galaxy M30 is easy to use the phone for your day to day lifestyle. You can easily shoot on the simple camera. You get ample storage space to keep your photos and videos.
The camera has 13 megapixels on back to capture crisp and bright memories with your friends and family and 16 megapixels on the front to click incredible selfies. The expandable storage is a godsend. I'm sure the day I head to college with my phone, I'll be the star of the group and my friends will keep asking me to take photos. I wouldn't mind doing that because the battery life is excellent too! Top it off it has a fast charger and I think my life is sorted.

If watching movies/videos is your prime focus, look no further than this. Samsung's beautiful AMOLED. Throw in a 5000-mah battery and quick charge, and you can't go wrong with it. Of course, handles WhatsApp and other general, everyday tasks without a hitch as well. However, PUBG and other  heavy-game gamers would be advised to seek out other options. Decent camera for the price.

The Phone is good, and value for money in term of Battery life, Screen Display, and also camera is good, the issue is the Touch is not upto the mark and there is lag time while you do a calling and also the touch is not respond at certain time , I have taken 6 GB Ram and 128 Internal  storage, still its not that great in touch.

M30 is almost perfect phone except that Samsung didnt care about Camera in this model. If your first preference is Camera, please do not buy this and regret later. Quality of photos is very average. Many options like slow motion, time lapse also not available.
Leaving camera aside, below are main highligts
1. Screen Display is super and watching 4K videos is absolutely pleasure.
2. Battery performance is good although it is not excellent.
3. 128GB internal storage and expandable storage is ultimate option

If Samsung takes care of camera in these mid range models no one buys S series..they know about it.

The Samsung M30 is an absolutely brilliant phone at its price point. The biggest positives are it's Super AMOLED display and 5000 mAH battery. The display looks gorgeous under all lighting conditions and the colors literally pop. The battery easily lasts 1.5 days even with heavy usage. The phone is quite light and feels nice to hold.  Samsung's Android skin is nicely done and quite responsive. The only negatives I can think of are the plastic back,  but I'm not complaining as the pricing of this phone is very competitive. The other is the bloatware apps that come preinstalled via Iron Source. It's been quite a while I've been so excited about a new phone. Overall a fantastic buy at this price point.

I liked the product immensely as it satisfies a hardcore traveler who has only the mobile for company and M30 perfectly fits the bill with top notch quality at an affordable price. I would simply say the three most important feature anyone should experience in a mobile should be 1.Battery-im a hardcore browser and stays for a long long time 2.Camera quality- absolutely stunning and worth the penny(low light &amp; normal light photo attached) 3.SAR value and the most important one,the prime reason for buying Samsung mobile as it is something which affects the health because of high Radiation and Samsung mobiles comes with very low SAR value and thus low radiation level unlike other Chinese brands. I would recommend Samsung anyday for its quality.
If somebody says inferior about the product then seriously they must try to change their attitude or the product.

Switched from redmi note 4 and really not regretting..
Mid level Gaming is smooth....
In 15000 it is value for your hard earned money.
Processor is smooth, no lagging even with 15 apps in background....
Overall excellent phone. After long time, I got satisfied with a low budget phone....

One of the worst mobile I have seen. I did a blunder buying this and Amazon didn't refund. Poor Camera(No color contrast, No Actual color of dress/other goods, very artificial colors), Poor Internet Connectivity, Poor touch response from Screen... Screen looks warn tone, Poor Sound quality from speaker, worst finger print scanner in back(made of Cheap plastic and loose).

Please don't buy this... Go for Redmi Note 7 Pro or Honor Play at similar price or less.

My mail to Samsung CEO will clear up the issue I am facing with samsung. I have also attached images.

Hi,
This is Rahul Godara, owner of a Samsung Galaxy M30. My phone was showing an issue with moisture in USB port which seemed to be just a software glitch and after waiting for a whole day the phone was not charging with the standard samsung charger but the same charger is working with other Xiaomi Remi Note 7. I called the Samsung customer care. They gave me resolution of either updating the device or take it to the Samsung service centre nearby, which unfortunately was TVS electronics in Dwarka ,Ramphal chowk ,sector-7, New Delhi. As I was not able to take the device with me to the centre my mom went there with the device. It was until now that we did not have an issue with a small scratch on the screen (just below the front camera on the bezel but not on the screen or camera) which was promoted in status by the customer care staff to a “crack” in screen. Any way the device did not have any issues with the screen it was just supposed to be charged and may be updated as suggested by the customer care person. The device was bought on 22nd May 2019 i.e. approximately 1 month before this incident. So, we hoped that we would not have to pay anything as we where there for a software issue. The customer care representative came in with the report that it is a crack in the screen and they cannot fix the screen until they get screen fixed for Rs. 6000 /- then only they will fix any other issues which were covered in the warranty. Once again I had no issues with the screen. They were adamant about the scratch being the crack on the screen and asked to either pay and get the phone fixed or they cannot help us.
I called the consumer court help line and registered a complaint ( Docket no. 1413754).
I received a call from samsung and have been receiving calls for almost one week. I have sent clear pictures of the scratch and have been very patient with he process being followed. But my patience have been wearing thin as the Samsung executive only calls if there is an update done by me to the consumer helping complaint and asking me to wait and never provides a resolution.
Is this the type of service samsung is imparting to its customers these days? I was a user of samsung phone ( galaxy note one ) and was very happy with it. The service and everything but had to leave because of similar issues in the past and now we are here again facing similar issues and with a realisation of making the same mistake again hoping samsung doing something better.

I had already submitted details of the device to  the samsung executive by the Dilasini Chaudhary in emails with subjects “Reagrding Samsung Device_3730657670” and “Sending more pictures of the scratch”.
The details of the device have been updated on the consumer complaint docket no. 1413754.

SM-M305F/DS
IMEI:xxxxxx/10/xxxxxx/4
IMEI:xxxxxxx/10/xxxxxx1/2
S/N: xxxxxxxxxxxx

Warm regards,

LATEST UPDATE: As soon as I sent the mail to Samsung CEO, I received a call from the person who has been delaying my issue. with the report that it is mishandling and we cannot resolve it. we have to sent it forward to management. from 28th of July today is 6th of July and the samsung M#) is lying on the desk just as a useless brick.

SO.... Don't Buy. Customer support should be priority even if you are a big company with phone banging(literal explosions case of galaxy note 7) everywhere.

Samsung has nailed this market segment with the inception of M series of smart phones, my latest pick which is the M30 brings segment best features like Super AMOLED display, Triple cameras, etc. The display is beyond words, this AMOLED display has great contrast, deep blacks, really saturated and popping colours which is the absolute best for consuming media like Netflix, YouTube, etc. And the display is pretty huge too at 6.4 inches but thanks to its minimal bezels and infinity-U notch, the overall footprint is quite handy! The M30 has a giant battery clocking at 5000 mAh which is more than plenty for day and a half's usage and yet the device is reasonably sleek and ergonomic.
And this time around Samsung went with a gradient back which in person looks very appealing. The back of the device also houses THREE cameras! The ultra wide angle lens is again the segment first and is really really convenient. The cameras in general is great with pretty good dynamic range once the HDR is turned on and the selfie camera has a lot of details and again has pretty good dynamic range with great skin tones. Samsung M30 has pretty impressive performance and is exactly why it's plenty fun to play PUBG and other games with heavy graphics, and the device never runs out of steam because of it's 6 gigabytes of LPDDR4 RAM. To sum it up, the Samsung Galaxy M30 has the right ingredients for a perfect smart phone for us millennials i.e. exceptional display, humongous battery, splendid cameras and mighty performance for the price that I paid.

My new Samsung Galaxy M30 hands down feels great overall, but to be more specific I'll point out few great things first and then those points are explained in details.

1. Great experience using AMOLED display.
2. 2 sims with SD card slot.
3. Triple Camera
4. Faster fingerprint and face unlock
5. Type C charging and 5000 mah battery with fast charging and light in weight
Now let me explain these in details,

1. With the AMOLED display looks so good and the while playing games and videos the feel is literally amazing

2. The phone although having a great storage capacity offers you a sd card slot with 2 sim cards.

3. I am really excited to use the new triple Camera setup in the Galaxy M30, with the triple camera. I can even can click great ultra wide shots for boosting up my smartphone photography skills.

4. The fingerprint and face unlock are comparatively faster than some other phones in this price range.

5. The Galaxy M30 houses a massive 5000mah battery that also supports 3X fast charging with type c charging, what more do you want at this price. Also with this big battery in the device it feels quite light weight.

Let's face it...
1.Any phone gets obsolete after minimum 8 months.. And the average time of use may be at least a year and half... If agreed then it is highly suggested to go for the 6 GB 128 GB Storage variant to help your phone be of any relevance.
2.its high time that amazon be serious about making available and suggesting the right and approved accessories as the wrong ones make the phone look cheap (example the quality of temper glass and the suggested case)
3.The adaptive display(auto adjust of brightness according to the environment isn't that adaptive and has a mind of its own.
4.This phone is definitely not a Ahhh...Wow phone and neither a Ohh...no phone.
5.Definitely needs a software and technical updates to utilise the phone to its full potential.
6.Camera is Really good for someone who isn't extremely serious about cameras. Requires a bit of updates too.
7.Sound from speaker could be a teeny tiny notch better but not bad either.
8.Amoled display is extremely good and I'm doubtful that I would downgrade to a lcd display.
9.Phone has 60%Of useful apps inbuilt removing the need to depend on third party apps filled with ads(ex. Antiviral, clone apps, screen power buttons etc)
10.Samsung itself doesn't recommend the dependability on face recognition that much while initiating and neither do I suggest it as an alrnative to good old password or pattern or fingerprint.

Overall...this phone is good for moderate to frequent users and not for extreme dependent users. I'm happy with this purchase and nothing can change that.

A very good phone at this price range. The Super AMLED display looks really stunning.  I read so many reviews says camera is worst but i feel the camera is good. The selfi camera is really good one. I was confused to go for M30 or Note 7 pro and finally decided to go with M30. I think that was good move. The phone looks premium even though the back is plastic.
Not sure about performance as i don't play games. The UI is good.Hope samsung will provide pie update with samsung one ui.
No notification light but it has always on screen feature which looks great.
There is no option for slow motion recording also no image stabilizetion. Battery is good. Speakers are nit loud but ok. Expecting pie update soon.

3rd Class GPS.
Very very poor network coverage.
Except fingerprint sensor all other sensors are confused all time.
Battery backup is ok.

This phone is not to playing PubG. Because It can't be run with a smooth network.

This review is based on both variants of M30 (4GB + 64GB) and (6GB +128 GB)
Me and my friend order both variants,
And we both are facing these problems, specially GPS and very low network coverage.

When you are in low network area the phone shows Emergency calls only ; whenever at same location other phone with same network operator shows more than 50% network.
And the internet access is also effect with network coverage, that's cause slow internet is irritating.😕

And the sound quality with my senheizer earphones is not good as like other samsung phones.

Guys please don't buy Samsung M series phones.
Because
Samsung reduce their quality too much for cost cutting.

I bought it for my dad, who travels a lot and forget to keep the mobile for charging every night. This mobile with 5000mah battery + Samsung super power saving mode ia give about 4-5 days of battery life ( if used only for calls )
Only thing is that power cable is too short and very cheap quality.

i will replace box cable with an amozon basic type C fast charging cable

Apart from cable quality, rest is acceptable

The phone is amazing
And I loved the picture quality of the phone ... Even the body of the phone looks attractive and it has got quick finger print sensor. How can I forget about the face recognition. The design is so nice also it has very light weight. This phone is everything you ask for. The best about this phone is it's price. It has such low price yet so many features. It's more like investing less and getting more. You will for sure love this phone and of course you won't regret investing in this phone. It's a very smooth phone and the photos are the best.

It's just an average mobile, reading the reviews earlier I decided to buy this but after using it for 2 weeks I am not happy with its performance.
Eventhough the battery size is 5000mah when you start using it it's just an average battery life. The fast charger doesn't work. It take more than 2 hrs to charge.

Camera considering the price is again "ok".

This smartphone is is easy to use for my daily lifestyle. If you wanna buy a budget phone then this is just perfect. Galaxy M30 is one of the cheapest phones with a triple camera setup. The camera system includes a 13MP primary camera with f/1.9 aperture, a 5MP wide-angle camera and another 5MP camera for depth sensing. On the front, the Galaxy M30 gets a 16MP front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture. The handset ships with Android 8.1 Oreo with Samsung's Experience UI 9.5 on top. The M30 supports dual Nano SIM cards with support for Dual 4G standby.The Galaxy M30 sports a large 6.4-inch Super AMOLED FHD+ (2340x1080) display. Samsung is using its Infinity-U panel for the Galaxy M30, which offers a U-shaped waterdrop notch on the top of the display to house the selfie camera. The Galaxy M30 comes with a plastic rear panel in gradient colours. It also sees a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and vertical triple camera system.Much like the Galaxy M20, the Galaxy M30 also houses a large 5,000mAh battery to offer a two-day battery life. I love this phone Samsung M30

90% of the screen turned white and is flickering. This happened suddenly when the phone was charging (I wasn't using it, just turned the screen on to check the battery percentage when it happened)

I hope I get a fix/replacement for it. Will update my review based on the resolution I get.

Edit: I did get a replacement but the whole experience was not pleasant. All things considered 3 Stars.

The phone provides a very good chipset and 5000 MAH battery ♥️. The size of the screen and the colour production is so superb it feels so premium especially at the price that I got it. The camera is mind blowing in the triple camera performs a very good job which feels like professional photography but its all captured in my smartphone. The ram of the phone is perfect too which makes me play my favourite game - PUBG without any lag and beat all my friend's records. Never seen a mobile like this in this budget range of under 18,000. Good job Samsung!! :)

This product is an over rated product.  To be honest , there are a lot of upgrades which have to be done from Samsung through the software . The phone itself is slow I mean it very slow in opening from the lock screen or even an app. Takes forever to see your face and recognize it, fingerprint reader is slow and not up to the mark. Display is good and battery is good. I use this phone for phone calls and minimum  apps as they will hang like all other Samsung do. Samsung needs to remove alot of unwanted apps and it's own galaxy apps and everything, slows down the phone alot.
Anyways I would suggest don't buy if you want a laggy and very slow phone .
I was so excited  to buy this phone and then it turned out to be a huge huge disappointment.  Sorry Samsung you need to really work on your processor  and apps .
Please release the next software update to fix quiet alot of issues

Pros:

1)Regarding Nozzle Display : It's best in the market. Easily beating MI Phone
2)Touch Screen : very smooth and fast response
3)Camera : Best quality one with new features of wide angle photos. Very good quality.
4)Battery : it's having 5000mah battery but not so impressive. It's last only one day. It's performance is almost same with 4000mah battery of Redmi phone.
5)External Memory : Unlike Redmi, it has dedicated SD card slot which removed our worries about running out of storage. Another thumbs up.
5) Network Strength : it's quite disappointing. At same place with same service provider SIM, Redmi phones has more signal strength than M30.
6) No stutter/ lag: Smooth experience when it comes to daily usage.
7) Minimal Heating: Very less heating. Some people have complained about heating during calls. I haven't faced any.
8) Call Clarity: It’s perfect

Cons:

1) No charging indication light
2) Notification Lights is not available
3) Head Phone is not included with the Box
4) Fast charging is not happening. Takes about 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 10%. Yes 2 hours is a lot but even the battery is large.
5) Pre-loaded security app not available.
6) Limited pre-loaded ring tones types

Overall I am quite satisfied and will recommend my friends can have a try with this one.

Samsung Galaxy M30. What a mid-range phone. For just Rs.15000/- we get a very great display. The super AMOLED display delivers just the most crisp details. Everything is really clear and it will be great in direct sunlight as well. Next best thing about the phone is the triple camera. The portrait mode does it's job on point. The edgings are perfect. The wide angle mode is the signature feature in this phone. The 5000 mAh battery lasts for almost two days on one full charge. Gaming has become more fun on this phone with the 1.8GHz octa-core Samsung Exynos 7904 processor giving a very smooth gaming experience. Moreover the phone is super light. All I can say is that, this is a really great phone at this price.

The overall phone build is good. Some features that are good but not spoken about:-
1. Battery optimisation similar to AI battery usage.
2. Blue light filter present which reduces the strain on eyes.
3. Battery life is simply amazing without compromising the performance. It fetches one full day even on heavy use.
4. No unnesessary apps and most apps that are already present can be deleted. So, we get around 90% free internal storage.
5. It has dragon trail pro glass.
6. Very smooth performance.
7. Display due to SAMOLED and speaker sound due to Dolby ATMOS is excellent.
  Marketing of the phone is not DONE well and It has many more good features

Now some drawbacks it has are:-
1. At this price the processor is not great in specs. Though, does multitasking well.
2. Call volume is low.
3. The entire phone, the screen as well as the back is a finger print magnet.
3. All Camera in outdoors and good light is good but not great low light photography.
4. The back cover is prone to scratches quickly, so get a back cover.
5. The glass also tends to get minute scratches but not easily seen.

As I said has more pros than cons

This phone is pretty good. It comes with three cameras at back with 13 megapixel, 5 megapixel and 5 megapixel which makes me look professional and same goes with the front camera which makes me take amazing selfies. It's battery backup is really good, it has 5000mAH and supports proprietary fast charging, I need not worry attending all my classes and yet manage to play a couple of games on my phone. It's got face unlock so you can quickly unlock your phone using your face. Lots Of RAM means more applications can run at the same time, which makes the mobile faster. More storage allows you to store more songs, videos, photos and install more applications. Its one of the best picks for me.

Pros:
1.Super Amoled display
2.Samsung UI (not a fan of mi ui)
3.Camera (both rear and front are good enough including live focus mode)
4.Battery life(excellent)
5.Fast charging

Cons:
1.Speed sucks (not so smooth while opening apps or while minimising the apps)
2.Face recognition and finger print are not so fast ( finger print is bit better )

Buy if you are looking up for a better battery and User interface.

P.S: Camera won't disappoint you unless you compare it with a much better camera.

Overall price wise its a good package when compares to Samsung's other device
Screen is the main usp and its fabulous also battery  is perfectly  powered
Picture  quality is not so great when compare to mi or honor devises even oppo and vivo
Also there is heating and build quality issue as the rear fingerprint reader shakes a little and back is prone to scratches
I also have compared it with samsung a50 which the looks are same but a50 stands superior  in miles when it comes to feel and camera but there is also a price difference of 5000 which is huge
Overall in this pricepoint this is a good phone for samsung lovers

I've been using M30 for the last 5 days and it has not let me down. The top features which prompted me to buy this phone are the Super AMOLED display, huge 5000 mAH battery and not to forget the dedicated memory slot. The display is crisp and beautiful and the battery is lasting 1.5 days since I am not a gamer, but I do watch movies and read ebooks. Prior to this I was using a Redmi Note 5 for the past 6 months which is also a good device but the OS MIUI was a big headache with it's ads everywhere. I am not a tech guy to know how to turn them off. So I was waiting for a device from Samsung and M30 it was. I got a 6GB+128 GB variant and it's smooth without any lags. But I love this display. The cameras are also good and give crisp and bright photos. Another feature which really impressed me is the Dolby Atmos for sound. I really mean it when I say M30 has the best features for it's price. Thank you Samsung for giving the M series.
The one thing I miss is the Android P update with Samsung One UI. Hopeful that Samsung gives these features very early with there update.

The device which I am using is Samsung Galaxy M30 which comes with 6gb RAM and 128gb of storage.
Samsung Galaxy M30 is powered by a 1.8GHz octa-core Samsung Exynos 7904 processor that features 2 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and 6 cores clocked at 1.6GHz. It has Mali G71 gpu.
Coming to the display it has 6.40-inch infinity U superAMOLED FullHD+ touchscreen and an aspect ratio of 19.5 : 9.The screen has very good viewing angles and looks very punchy.It has that auto brightness option too.
Moving on to the camera it has a rear triple camera setup which is a very nice thing.We have 13 MP main camera @ f1.9 + 5MP Wide Angle camera + 5 MP Depth sensing camera.Moving to to the front camera it's a 16MP shooter.
It's having a huge 5000 mAh battery which is a good thing for heavy users. We can easily get 10-12. Hrs of screentime in this device.
Moving on to the charger it has USB type-C port which is actually a good thing. The charger is a fast charger that is 9 Volts at 1.6 ampere.
Coming on to the device it has a polycarbonate back with gradiant colour i.e. at the top it is more bluish and becomes black at the bottom. It actually gives it a premium look and also at the back we have finger unlock sensor.
In addition it has a dual SIM slot(both 4G) plus a dedicated micro SD slot also which is a nice thing as well.Its memory is expandable up to 512 gb.
The phone has Android oreo 8.1 and Samsung Experience 9.5 UI.
It's a good phone with good built quality and I like all the features especially the tripple camera setup. It has that wide angle lens which gives a different perspective and it is a good feature to have on a smartphone. The pictures come out to be good with good colours.The camera does a very good job in low light conditions also.

It's a value for money kind of a device!

I have bought  this phone  on flash sale after using  this phone  for about 8 days i am writing this  review so that you could  judge how it is worthy. I used many chinese phones and was fed up of hardware that they provide.
Pros:
1) Amazing Display
2) call quality  is awesome
3) sound is Amazing
4) Hardware  is always dependable  i,e y brand matters
5) Battery  lasts long,about 1 day using heavy like playing  PUBG,calling, internet  using and much more .And about 1.5 days using medium and 2_3 days using calling  only.
6) Ram management  is upto the mark.
7)Fast charger is really  fast.
8) I am also a pubg lover and you can play pubg without  lag at default  settings.
Cons:
1) Worst rear camera 6/10 , may be it will get better after update,zooming  image one time tears down image quality  wholly .Front camera is not upto the mark 4/10
2) Processor is laggy but much better than previous  ones .However  it does the required  work well.
3) Build quality  is unimaginably  weak.One can easily  get display  cracked if dropped on LCD side .Backside finish  is premium  but of polycarbonate which is not so strong  to absorb shock.
4) Software needs to be  patched  so that UI  may beome smooth.
5) Proximity  sensor works only first time when you cover it during call and then doesn't  wake display automatically next time which  may be a software  problem .May be after Pie update + One UI .
I am still happy with this phone because i found  its pros more heavier  than cons.

This is one such phone I have been waiting for a very long time. I had researched quite a few things about the phone before buying and trust me after having it delieverd at my place I wasn't disappointed. Lucky me.The features this phone has to offer is exciting and I can’t wait to get my hands on it, Samsung has like always layed the stone in the market and with the M series coming in, the phone has spoken for itself. The infinity display is just outstanding. The camera of the M30 is amazing, can’t wait to know what more it has in store for us. The music which is hitched with the Dolby sound is going to killiing it in the sound department. On an overall feedback I’d say this is phone is a must buy. Also, it comes witH 64GB storage and how can I forget such battery life. It has 5000MAH battery life which can work for 4 days, at least. The phone is just fo 14,990 and with such amazing features what more can I ask for.

Exciting launching offers where not availed along with Samsung M30. Looks like we need to do a separate purchase for I AM COVERED, I AM PROTECTED and 2 more that was mentioned in launching offers. Completely dissatisfied with this promotion, since no where it is mentioned that we need to do a separate purchase for the same, then there is no point in mentioning them as exciting offers. Very bad promotion.

Have been using the device for almost 2 weeks now and also had an incident where the phone fell on the floor from a height of 2feet and the screen has cracked. What good is the gorilla glass !!!!
Battery is good lasts almost 2 days complete. Charging is faster than usual devices if u use the charger given in the package. The display is brilliant and rich. Camera is also better than Xiaomi devices. Face recognition is good though can be faster at times. I think the phone is a little slow not sure who else has experienced this but as compared to my other device which is a iPhone 7 this seems to be slow even when the native apps are being used. The other thing is that the adaptive brightness is not very adaptive, it reacts slowly to adapt to ambient light that also can be attributed to the device speed, so people should check this with other users as well

Samsung has really created a masterpiece. I have been using it for the last 10 days. I have used other Samsung phones but this one is something different. Here, I am listing the pros and cons of this mobile phone.
Pros -
1- The battery is great. 5000 mah battery give you more than a full day backup on moderate use. The power saving mode of Samsung is worth going for. Use it wisely and I guess the juice will not run out for 2 or more days. I have tried that recently while I was traveling.
2- Display is awesome. It feels.
3- Design is also great. I have the blue one and it looks beautiful. The navigation settings let you make the navigation buttons disappear and you experience a better screen.
4- The fast charging works really fast.
5- Camera is great. Both front and back. Especially in low light conditions. Flash is awesome. Zoom is also great.
6- No Hybrid slot is what I seek in the phones these days. Thus, you are not limited by the storage issue if you are using the dual sim.
7- Dual 4g is good. Now, I can use my BSNL 3g and at the same time, my Jio works fine.
8- Face recognition and fingerprint unlocking are very fast.
9- Touch sensitivity is very much.
10- I got 200GB space on One Drive for two years free with this device.

Cons -
1- The wide angle lens needs some improvement. The picture quality is just OK. But as this is a new experience, I would not say its a major con.
2- The placement of earphone is downwards so when you want to use your phone earphone and charger plugged in, it becomes a little difficult to operate.

For now, this is my experience, I'll keep updating.

The infinity U display one of the most feature in this series. FHD display,5000 mah battery and the camera's are awesome.Also samsung has change their home button and logo from the front body.  i just unbox it further experience will updated later.
The packaging of the product is so poor and hectic condition there is no safety comparing with other seller's, one more thing is this phone is country locked can use only in india . if you want to change this you can go to the samsung store itself.

Today i will write a genuine review of this Samsung M30 after use of 1.5 month.
1. Rear camera quality is clear in outdoor mode but reading face is very poor and indoor  plus night picture quality is very dull.
2. Front camera is good but no slo motion video available.
3. Battery life even after 5000 mah is just like making fool to us. Battery remains not even 24 hrs after heavy plus medium use. Totally fake 5000 mah battery.
4. Type C Charger is awesome. Keep it safe as this is realy good and original charger.
5. Touch screen and UIM is fine but little bit lagging in operating softwares.
6. Still no Android Pie is available.
7. No geomagnetic sensor given. False feature given.
8. Today people buy mobile for better picture quality. Camera feautres are less.
9. Screen having AmoLed is fine.
10. Ultra wide angle camera is 5 mwga pixel works but click very blur photo.
11. A mobile for 14990 is worst to buy as in less price than this mobile lots of option available.
12. Samsung dont provide screen protection and back cover with mobile so very hard to find cover and temperate glass in market.
13. Screen size 6.4 with notch display is fine.
14. Mobile goes heat up after heavy use and even charger gone heat up after charging mobile.

6gb ram it claims is only on paper. The phone works like a 2gb ram phone and camera quality is very poor. Not worth the money.  Called Amazon on the first day I received this phone. They are of no use. The basic features are missing in this phone. No option to block spam messages,  the full screen  videos don't work for YouTube,  no option to turn off camera shutter sound... the list goes on. Stay away from this phone. And it takes more than 3hrs to fully charge.

I am very sensitive person when it comes to what phone I will choose. So my review will be extremely honest. And "to the point".. All Samsung users will understand but users of Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo may not understand. See down-
1. Display: This is the main reason of me purchasing this phone over any other phone. I am a user of Samsung A9 Pro which came in 2016. It was a flagship category phone at that time. Infact I am writing this review on it. Okay, lets get to the points why I said this. Display has Amoled and I like only Amoled panels. But when I placed A9 Pro side by side I felt M30 is 5% less bright. It can be fixed with just one update. I just mentioned it. It is perfect but it requires just one more update where the company can fix it.
2. Camera: The camera in A9 Pro is 16 MP and I believe Samsungs camera is the best and 16 MP is the highest it offers. Now M30 is 13MP. Forget that 3 cameras or what is there in the front. Most people in most cases only need the back camera. I am talking about that. I have taken a few shots like 20- 30 photos. And I got an idea. I can say camera is okay. But it cannot beat A9 Pro as of now. It requires just one update. By that I dont mean it is bad. I mean " little bot of clarity" is needed. Regular Samsung users will understand this point. One thing I dont like is this camera application does not allow quick launch from pressing lock key or volume key. Since A9 Pro had physical home button double pressing it launches the camera. Now it is gone. The company could given the option for double pressing volume button (down or up) or double pressing lock button just like Nokia 5.1 Plus. Or shake to launch just like Motorola phones.
So these are the main highlights of the phone that this phone has over M20. I discussed them in some details. Obviously I did not say how much pixel which camera has etc because I am not writing this review for naive users.
Let us now see some other aspects-
1. I did not like the hand feel. Now a days the companys are making vertically long phones. This effects the way we use phones. Hands cant reach the top. And yes this display appears smaller than A9 Pro because of this only. This ruins the feel of carrying a nice phone. It effects the aesthetics.
2. Other things are just okay. But I can say it cant still beat A9 Pro.
Conclusion: I believe the phone can be improved a lot by updates. The issues that mentioned are mostly software based. Not hardware. And "it can be fixed by the company if it thinks so". After that it will be near flawless. I said near beacause this phone is plastic. Thats the reason!

I bought this phone for my younger brother who is not at all interested in gaming so for people like him,this phone was excellent as it had triple rear camera and 5000 mAh battery.Overall,this phone is a nice product from Samsung in Value for Money segment.

It is warst smart phone. Phone hange many times and sometimes phone touch unresponsive(3 to 4 times in day). 2 good points are cameras and battery. I suggest don't buy this phone. I am using smart phone till 2011 and this one(Samsung M30) is warst phone ever. I suggest please don't buy this phone and search other options.

This phone doesn't meet my expectations even after paying 18k didn't get 10k phone features
Such as, mirroring or cast, this phone is lacking those features where MI gives under 10k-15k range of phones

Antenna: I have checked at different location this phone has data speed issue whereas i have checked the same network gives better speed than this such as, MI MAX 2

Plus, Amazon service also not as flipkart
Amazon clearly says no to replace phone when you are dissatisfied with phone performance

Overall, Samsung should accept defeat against MI and other brands
now i know why, Samsung is losing market share to MI, Vivo, Oppo

The screen display died after 5 days. No software reset (vol down +power ) doesn’t reboot for display to get back. This phone rings and chimes but dead display. Phone is scratchless and spotless. We had barely transferred the data. These days for seniors this is the only line of communication for outside world with all critical help numbers from doctors to plumbing to electricians.
I am seriously never going to buy the Samsung phone or other expensive item from amazon.
After calling amazon they scheduled a no show technician and have delayed and refused to replace the phone thus far.
This phone is for senior citizen with medical condition and amazon instead of helping quickly has been delaying the replacement for last 6 days.
Worst phone. This was replacement for 4 year old iPhone 6s which never ever went bad.
Worst amazon customer service for not assisting in quick replacement for senior citizen with medical condition.

Worst purchase ever total waste of money. I purchased this phone few months of ago but it have some problem from the first day even I visited service center but they always do nothing and says it's working fine. Everytime it hangs while playing games and if you working on the same for a hour or a two. There are so many problems and every application have bugs no one can fixed it. Finally, I sold it out and will be buying new phone today.

Okay i have both 4 gb and 6 gb varients...

Now on 4gb we get everything smooth... Just the in game audio on speaker is slightly less... (mb due to in game call like pubg) however online games... Heavy games may give u a lag on 4 gb varient but 6 gb is flawless.. Pubg lovers can welcome this phone as there are zero lags and HD graphics supported.. So the full pc emulator view on your hands.
Camera... Is awsome with low light imaging and image stablization... Wide angle... Potrait mode... Nevertheless a beautiful camera...

I ll say go for it... It has a huge battery life and you can play games or use it over 10 hrs... Even if u use it savagly.

I pirchased 6gb from samsung directly however i got 4gb on flash sale.. The delivery i had was next day and got deliverd in 24 hrs.

I bought my device on 16 .after usage of 3 days it's working very smoothly and fastly.The performance  on PUBG and FREE FIRE with high graphics is superb.But after gaming more than 1hour the battery slightly get heated.while it's common on every phone in this budget.
  Next came to camera .Triple rear it's just amazing.the depth sensor with ultra wide angle camera gives u a perfect shot.The selfie camera is super even in low light .but the low light shots on rear camera it's not about full clarity .
  The phone get charged within 2 hours with c type charger.The huge 5000mah battery did not  get lesser than 25 %after heavy usage for a day.
  I forgot about its display.its osm .because of AMOLED Screen .
  The face lock works fast and also it recognizes  ur face in low light conditions.
  Fingerprint sensor is also too fast..
  The speakers also work smoothly and loudly.
Finally if u want a better phone on all the segments simply go for it.

Overall the product is good, but the face recognisition doesn’t work well. The finger print recognition sensor has a lag aswell. The display is good and the battery life is decent in this price range. Dint try the gaming yet(will try to post d feedback after trying few good games). People who r upgrading from a smaller phone will have some difficulties in handling initially. The touch sensor is very good and you’ll get used to it within a couple of days. Video recording is decent, but the inbuilt speakers of the phone r not that great in terms of sound quality.
Camera quality is good not the best.
Overall its a decent device looking at the price range.
The phone is fast(not as fast as shown in the promo)
Let us see after a long term use.

I have many complaints

1) It's (m30)marketed as exynos 7904 processor but , I got a unit with exynos 7885 processor . This is main cheating .

2)There is no light sensor , (I know front camera act as light sensor) but it's speed is pathetic I have adjust brightness every time . Shame for device of 15000 Rs cost .

3)Even after taking calls screen will not lit up automatically I have to manually do it(because of lack of light sensor and poor quality of proximity sensor ).

4) Speaker volume is not good (compare to old Samsung feature phones) and sound cracks more often . Head phone volume is low and it's not having good quality like old Samsung phones .

5)Ultra wide angle camera quality is waste it's 5mp wide angle so no details in pictures at all .

6) No native support for using amoled screen as led notification light . Have to use NoLED third party app.

7) 13MP main camera fully waste . Pictures taken have short range clarity but doesn't have details of distance objects (remember my old Motorola g4 get more detailed distance shots). I think camera module is not up to the mark (cost cutting ???)

8) status bar fonts are very small and no option to add extra icons like internet speed etc , there is no option in setting to increase status bar font .

9) data toggle buttons ( between to two Sims ) is not available in notification bar.

10) Samsung Galaxy apps always runs in background and collecting your information ,  no option for galaxy apps to stop in background and apply battery optimization. Often "install galaxy apps " ad pops up very annoying .

11) Even phone colour theme cannot be changed unless you  buy Samsung Galaxy themes

12) Exynos processor means to no custom ROM development.

13)Fragile screen with no screen protection (dragon tail is there but no good).

14) fast charger is total waste , you can't get much charge in short time so no 5 min charge and talk 2 hours like feature .

15)  No otg support for laptop hard disc with external case ( even some old phones support other for hard disc).

16)No correct size external cases and tempered glass support .

i am very much disappointed by Samsung pls don't buy this phone i will tell u why not to buy this phone
i ordered this phone twice in the sale of amazon and both the time there was a problem with the phone
on my first purchase, the display was not properly fixed to the phone and on second purchase the fingerprint was not proper the quality of the phone is worst then some Chinese phone out there in the market
because of the sale and limited stock samsung is not doing the quality check on the phone
i will recommend you to go for iphone 6 which is 100 times better then this phone yes the display is good but i think u r not buying a phone only for display. think  before u waste your 15000

When it comes to Samsung M30, you know you're in a good deal. From the display to the look of it, I love every single bit of it. The blue gradient color is one to look out of for. When it comes to using it, you have a power packed device in your hand. Powered with Android 8.1, it is the latest one in the market making it already a favourite. When it comes to RAM, it handles it all. The camera is pretty impressive and the display is an infinite making it amazing to view at. The battery life on the other hand, is long enough letting you do whatever you want to. Even if the battery is low, it charges up extremely fast enough to enjoy your phone once again. The fast charger is a unique and a must have one. The camera has all the settings of that a professional camera, making it an amazing option to have. I highly recommend this for all students.

Good product considering its price.
The design is great.
It is great for people who are looking for a phone near 15k with AMOLED display.
There processor is good and runs tasks smoothly.(comparing processors in the same price band).
The screen is just beautiful ....... it changes the screen information .... Wallpapers everytime you lock and unlock the phone.
The battery is massive ...... 5000 mAH....... runs almost two days.
Excellent .

Cons:
Heating Issue, when you use phone for 20 minutes, it will become hot to handle
Looks heavy, not slim, not handy in length and width.
Sound quality is terrible, not at all good.
Samsung ON Nxt is good compared to this in Sound quality.

Pros:
6 GB Ram, 128 GB Memory
Camera is Good
Very fast even after installing 60 Mobile applications.

Overall, there is no option to return or I would have returned it.

A person searching for good camera quality , enough ram and gb here's the search for them. M30 the perfect phone gives us the perfect infinity display without wasting any space on screen gives us a proper wide screen. The phones battery life is super good that on an average after regular use of mine in my old phone i use to charge thrice a day but after this phone , its even left with some good battery at the end of the day. The trio camera gives the perfectly wide angle picture in which your whole group looks super cute. The super fast phone it is. I found the perfect phone match what i wanted.

The signal reception on the phone is very very poor and when rarely it does appear there is sharp crackling sounds during the call which makes impossible for calls. Initially my mom ignored the problem but now when I re-checked it, I realized it's an hardware issue and the return window of 10 days is closed already. Do not buy. Amazon's flash sale is only a fraud concept.

Excellent display with good performance and good camera.

I bought this phone for my brother.
 Myself using redmi note 7 pro for past 2 months. This is my comparison.

M30 has the super display, and it's display u
 quality is evident during night (deep blacks made  me speech less) and in sunlight (better visibilty than redmi.)
In the room light, both looks alike.
Always on display in m30 is a cool thing which is the monopoly of amoled display.

Processor 7904 exynos vs Snapdragon 675
Redmi is the clear winner even though, that doesnt makes much difference in normal usage.

Camera
redmi is the clear winner with sony sensor,  but here m30 has near good quality.

Battery redmi 4000 mah vs m30 5000mah

M30 gives better backup with its 5000mah battery, amoled screen.
but its 14nm soc is not that much efficient as Snapdragon 11nm. So thr difference is narrow in high performance usage.

Build quality,
Of course the redmi with its 2 side gorrila 5 protection. Samsung doesnt feel cheap with its normal glass and plastic build.
But m30 is comfortable to hold because of its curved edges.
M30 sar value is .4
Refmi .96 higher radiation

Take home message.
Consider m30, if you want better display, and your main purpose is for browsing, watching videos, and reading. Also the amoled display causes less strain to eyes especially in night reading.

Consider redmi note 7 pro , if you are a power user and can compromise amoled display.

Excellent product. Go with this beast. If you are looking for a perfect smart buy then go with this M30🔥🔥🔥. Awesome selfie camera, the rear camera gives you a flagship level with the triple camera at this price range. The ultra wide feature is amazing. Then the 5000 mAh with fast charging battery gives massive performance. Then the Super AMOLED full HD display is terrible. Great product for this price with a great specs, suggesting all to buy this one if you are looking for best one🔥🔥🔥

Pro- cheap and best. Ram and internal memory is good.
No hanging issue as it have 6 GB RAM. Internal memory is 128 GB make a huge space means world is in your hands and you can save any thing .Extra one is extended external memory.
Camera is very good and good pic in dim light or night also. Better then Chinese mobile.
Cons:-Heating problem.
Battery back is not as expected.  J7prime battery is better than M30.
Looks Beautiful.
Conclusion -Enjoy the life with M30 Better than any other mobile in this range.
Go for M30
Thanks

One of the good mobile in this segment and price bracket. Perfect gift for parents. Worth every penny.

It comes with an sAMOLED display so you can get a brighter screen and better viewing angle while compared to the LCD panel mobiles. Daylight photography, performance is good.

Pros:
- Best display: sAMOLED display
- Good Battery life: 5000 Mah battery
- Low SAR: lower radiation
- Slim and Lightweight
- will get fast charger(15W) along with mobile

Cons:
- The back panel is slippery and feels like non-premium
- Doesn't come Earphones along with the mobile
- poor low light photography (primary and secondary) and lacks details on front cam

Overall good product from Samsung.

Phone does not respond many a times, even if you keep pressing touch screen. It is very surprising as it has not been experienced by me in any model or make earlier. Don't go by the reviews of this product on Amazon as they are all for 4GB/6GB models. Please remember this product is 3 GB and launched on 28/09/2019, so immediate reviews are not available. It appears there is no management between RAM and processor as phone looks confused at times and does not respond. I think Samsung should issue an update soon to manage RAM-PROCESSOR synchronization  seamlessly for M30 (3GB) otherwise product will fail

I bought this Product in sale and SIM card tray did not opened. I approached nearby mobile shop for help. He upon seeing mobile set said SIM tray will not open as another customer approached him yesterday with same problem . This means entire lot has this problem
When tried to return the mobile set, Amazon says they have only replacement policy for this product and I can not return the product. Now waiting for their technician to come up and certify that product is faulty.  Then only they will replace it. ...... my worst fear is what if the replacement has same issue.

Average phone... you're better off with an Asus or a moto.. the UI is very inconvenient.. takes a lot of getting used to.. even then using the phone is an annoyance rather than second nature.
The screen is super bright so that's a plus . And the battery backup is very very good... if it was a more sturdy build would have served a better purpose as a work phone coz you don't have to ask anyone for a damn charger.
That stupid pin with which you take the sim slot out should be banned for all phones. Could have had some other mechanism or at least give me a place to keep it..
The colour reproduction is okay... seems a bit washed out.
Random bugs and lags especially during basic functions like calls... very very annoying.
Finally the biggest drawback... the touch accuracy is down the drain... I have to touch min 5 times to pause a damn video... it's a nightmare if I want to skip ahead.
So if you need a phone maybe just to call and basic WhatsApp then this is the guy .. doesn't look too shabby... performs alright.. battery is awesomeness.
But if you want a little more out of your phone.. just go to the other 5000 mah battery ones.
Only reason I got this phone was for the fast charging 5000 mah battery which I wasn't  getting anywhere else.

So honestly, speaking when it comes to getting a mobile phone I do a lot of reseach but owning Samsung M30 makes me feel good! So me being me, photoholic M30 provides with amazing 13MP camera,supports Face Detection and high dynamic range(HDR) imaging as well. It is perfectly appropriate for people who considers battery backup above all. With such great features, the charging port at the bottom is reversible Type-C and the SIM tray has a dedicated card slot.Also, one can effortlessly look through photographs and send messages on the 6.38 inches .Okay now the best part its super long lasting battery life. Being always ready with 64 GB+ 4GB memory and having 3X charging capability is what makes it different from others. There’s no denying that the Samsung Galaxy M30 is super classy, affordable, easy to access and is a must buy. If you’re looking for a phone with big battery and good camera, Galaxy M30 is worth having. And not to forget its light weight and lastly, I am a happy customer of Samsung M30

Camera is bad, too much lengthy phone, 6.4 inch screen is too high,,, no need of this much big display. Amoled display is soo sooper. Loving it. Dolby atmos with my one plus bullets wireless earphones is excellent. Battery will last one day in very high usage.... Even 2 days in low usage. Fast charging takes almost 2hrs 15 minutes to full charge 5000mah battery from 5 percent. UI is better for me. Not that much glamorous in looks. I hope not to find any lag issues with exynos processor. I am not a gamer. But i am high user of internet, social media, and lots of other things.... Found no specific problems in it. It will take some time to learn all settings in it. I am loving it besides of its size. (bottom bessels are somewhat larger)

Worth 15K this is just another average phone.
With a slight lag in the user interface, it does sport a good screen whereas the performance remains on the slower side.
I'll rate it 3 out of 5

Writing after one month use. The product is good for everyday use... easy to hold not like other vivo oppo mobiles which has problem of holding due to big size... screen  battery and wide angle camera is top notch. Samsung need to work on camera software. Picture taken is good compared to note pro most of the time due to great dynamic rage, but potrate mode and absence of eos video qualities are not that good. So Samsung hope you will improve image stabilization... If yoh afe thinking you need a good mobile with great battery and for normal photography and watches YouTube's video or movie this is the one for you.... please like if you are impressed by the photos taken by me from m30...

This smartphone is easy to use for my daily lifestyle. The camera system includes a 13MP primary camera with f/1.9 aperture, a 5MP wide-angle camera and another 5MP camera for depth sensing. On the front, the Galaxy M30 gets a 16MP front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture. The handset ships with Android 8.1 Oreo with Samsung's Experience UI 9.5 on top. The M30 supports dual Nano SIM cards with support for Dual 4G standby.The Galaxy M30 sports a large 6.4-inch Super AMOLED FHD+ (2340x1080) display. Samsung is using its Infinity-U panel for the Galaxy M30, which offers a U-shaped waterdrop notch on the top of the display to house the selfie camera. The Galaxy M30 comes with a plastic rear panel in gradient colours. It also sees a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and vertical triple camera system.Much like the Galaxy M20, the Galaxy M30 also houses a large 5,000mAh battery to offer a two-day battery life. Samsung M30 is the best of all the phones.In love with this phone.

The Samsung Galaxy M30 is a very slim and neat looking phone. It is a very affordable phone for the numerous features it displays. The triple rear camera and ultra wide lens gives you a real image of the world around you! The live focus and blur control are great for photo shoots. Another amazing feature is the 5000mAh battery which can last you an entire day. Being a college student we're at college or internships during the day and we only get home late at night,so I know with this phone I don't have to worry about the phone dying on me. Another thing I don't have to worry about is space on my phone, although it is 128 gb it is expandable to 512gb. The security on the phone is amazing with the face scanning feature as it is very accurate. The phone comes with Dolby Atmos 360° surround sound which makes listening to music even more fun! All these features makes the Samsung Galaxy M30 a great phone to purchase!

Brought it mainly for the battery. Consider the A50, a better phone in all possible ways.
Postitives :
Great disaply, rich in color.
Awesome battery, lasts 2 days in heavy usage.
Good audio quality for music via headphones.
Good front camera.
Good bokeh camera lens.

Negatives:
Absolute rubbish camera, doesnt even have the quality of an old 5mp camera. Wide angle has almost no details in images. Main camera images have no detail and poor color reproduction.
No slow motion video support.
Poor cell reception, and 4G reception.
Wifi connection drops frequently and at times refuses to connect.
Lots of Samsung bloatware in os.
Display is fragile, not a gorilla glass dispaly.
No news of OS updates yet.

Samsung Galaxy M30 is easy to use. It has a gorgeous AMOLED screen and looks really good from the front. The screen is vibrant and offers pretty satisfactory legibility indoors and outdoors. There's no denying that the Galaxy M30 is super comfortable to wield, which is really saying something since the phone houses a massive 5000mAh battery.On moderate to heavy usage, Galaxy M30 can easily last more than a day. Our use case included lots of browsing, music and video streaming, and gaming.The camera has 13 megapixels on back to capture crisp and bright memories with your friends and family and 16 megapixels on the front to click incredible selfies. The smartphone comes with a feature of easy mode that helps you to get right what you want with a simple interface. On a whole, the Samsung Galaxy M30 is great.

Using this one since a month now hence thought will give an unbiased account.

Good:
1. AMOLED display is vibrant. Always on display feature is better than a notification light.
2. Battery life is sufficient for more than a day in average usage on 3g/4g connectivity.
3. Infinity display helps justify the phone size in pocket and while browsing docs or webpages.

Bad:
1. AOD missing customization options. Ex. Motorola Droid ultra like AOD-check YouTube videos for comparison.
2. People say Samsung batteries malfunction after 6-9 months and deteriorate in performance. I can feel that at times but I think it's not the battery tech, but the software interface which is poor in resource and power management.
3. Microphone clarity is not like Nokia.
4. Camera is average, especially low light photography is really poor.

Ugly:
1. Software interface is shit. Samsung one UI or Android one on Nokia is better..much better.
2. Phone hangs! Yes 6gb phone hangs while using apps. The on screen buttons freeze. Exynos processor coupled with the poor software interface are a pain in the arse. Poor processor performance compared to Asus snapdragon phones or even Nokia 6.1 plus.

I have been using this phone since last three weeks and has fallen in love with this piece of budget phone. I am not a gamer, so my basic needs are a lot of calls, few snapshots including scanning some documents with CamScanner, a bit of music and movies, WhatsApp, surfing net and, of course, long battery life. To my surprise, it meets all my needs.
Here I have tried to sum up my review in the form of Pros and Cons.
Pros:
---------
1. Stunning Super Amoled Display- I am pretty sure it will also be the first thing to attract everyone. It shows very deep colours which u won't see in normal lcd/tft displays.
2. Its Big battery- True 5000 mah battery. It gives me two days power. It takes around 2h 20m to get fully charged, which I think really fast for such a big battery.
3. Dedicated Card Slot which is rare nowadays (Believe me, I am one of those who will never buy a phone with Hybrid slot)
4. Adaptive Fast charging and inclusion of fast charger in the box.
5. Camera Configuration, especially the wide-angle camera. Shutter speed is also remarkably fast. It gives stunning pictures in daylight, though low light performance is bit down. But considering the price, I don’t have any grudge about it.
6. Beautiful Colour with radiation effect.
7. Beautiful u notch front camera whole with minimum bezels around the display.
8. Call Clarity - both audio and video
9. Speaker output is great. Listening to music and watching movies are great experience.
10. Samsung Experience v9.5. It has most of the the features and gestures one needs in an android device. I love the OS very much, especially as compared to Xiomi and Honor phones.
11. Always on display is an added beauty as well as advantage.
12. Superfast and accurate Fingerprint Scanner and Face Unlock.

Cons:
---------
None for me so far. Only I miss a Back Case in box which nowadays every company is providing, even Samsung is also providing cases in other phones.
As I am not a gamer, I have nothing to say about the Processor. Please read some other reviews for this particular point of view. But I can say its RAM Management is great. It keeps all the apps and processes in memory until I manually kill one. This is I think a great point to notice while buying a smartphone.

As it mentioned in the features, it is.
There are many camera features missing especially slow motion n timelapse which mostly I prefer they must've enabled.
I was looking for my day to day office productivity n entertainment device which it is.
Finally it's completely a entertainment specific device mean Super amoled display with Dolby atmos and supports Amazon prime n Netflix HD content and my favourite hotstar for watching cricket matches.
I'm completely new to Samsung devices n I'm satisfied with the performance I've expected.

1) Battery charging issue- full charge time 3.30 hours.
2) Brightness issue - taking too much time for brightness adjustment
3) Hanging issue - phone is hanging
4) Battery draining is too fast.
5) Speaker is not good.... Very low sound.

Over all my view.. DON'T PURCHASE THIS PHONE.

Had bought a M30 from the seller STPL online(SAVEX TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED) and product was well received in full packing in April first week.  There was some issue with Audio reception and delivery, has checked the reviews and found some similar issues in the reviews,After using for 02 months without major issues, in July first week one morning when I took a call, it got flickered and there was no display after the same, later checked with Samsung service centre and told its a physical damage and could not covered in warranty. Honestly I was surprised as there was no damage happened from my side and mobile was not even having any scratch. Had reported issue with Amazon Support also and even after waiting for 02 months, they also told they cannot help in this issue as the seller as denied the request.Now I felt that I have been cheated by sending some refurbished or any returned product which had lead to such an damage after using it for around 60 Days..So I think its better to buy from shops directly.

I received a defective Samsung Galaxy M30 from Amazon. When I am trying to turn on , it boots to the logo then goes to the "Samsung M30 powered by Android " screen, then it stays there. I've tried to do a hard reset by holding down the power button and the volume up button and have done reboot and still gets hung on the "SAMSUNG M30 " logo. I contact customer services of amazon but they also failed and arranged a Technician visit. After 2 days, Technician agent verify the mobile and reported to Amazon about this problem. After that amazon send a replacement unit to my address. Amazon transport service agent come my address and say that after verification mobile will be replace. Agent trying to turn on the device to get IMEI no. How is this possible? Phone already dead/hung at samsung logo. Agent said that if he saw IMEI number on mobile screen, then replacement will done. I contact customer services about this matter but no solution. Replacement is rejected by amazon transport agent . I saw order details in my amazon app, it shows replacement unit rejected by customer 🙄. I surprised about the service provided by amazon. There is no connection between amazon customer support, Amazon Transport agent, amazon app but managed Amazon india😆😆. All unit are managed by amazon but there is no connection and understanding between them. I think for mobiles flipkart is best and services provided by them is also great. Please do not purchase mobile phones from Amazon. Services provided by amazon is really worst. For this reason 95% of new Mobile phone lunched on flipkart. When purchase mobile phones on Amazon, think twice.

Battery life is good with 5000mah and 3times fast charging,happy with that
Picture quality is good.
Display with notch looks fantastic.
Finger print is better than face unlock.
Finger print should have placed little down.. its difficult to touch..
For heavy games it's not sutiable.
The only think I have disappointed is there is no notification led..
Overall phone is good..
It could  be better if they provide earphones and pouche..

i ordered this product to replace my galaxy J7 pro which i bought years back and also to upgrade to a 6+ 128 GB and i thought i got a great deal. when i set up the phone, it was sooo easy to bring everything from my old phone to thw new one. it was almost a bezel less phone and beautiful. then i found out that i didnt have my Whatsapp transferred so i accessed Playstore from my new M30 and when i clicked on Install, nothing worked. the button simply clicked and it was not loading  I tried that for all the Apps and it wasn't working. I did a factory reset and proceeded as a totally new phone without transferring my data from the old phone but nothing happened. the same problem exiated. then I contacted Amazon customer Care and they told me to Reset and i Did the same. Then finally i again requested Customer Care for help and they sent some Tech person to see and  asi g on the report, that the phone has some software glitches, it got returned for a replacement.  i still liked the phone so i was excited when the Replacement Unit was delivered.  but then again, the same Problem.  so in the end, i had to send the phone back and i got a refund. i am still have my J7 pro and i love the camera quality better of the old phone. when i tried to do a selfie with the M30, it was a bit dizzying to look at and the image quality is not so great.  so to replace my Samsung J7 Pro, i simply went ahead and got myself a Note 10 plus. so lets see how my samsung story goes!!!

What I like
Battery life. 1.5 days at least
Ultra power saving mode. It can extend the battery life by one day, acting as a basic phone without any external media filled apps.
Camera is decent. Front camera has software to auto edit the pics. I did not like the audio editted pics. Looks artificial.
Rear camera is just decent enough. In bright light the camera pics are excellent. Low light pics are not up to the mark.
What's good is the super amoled screen. Clear, crisp, and maybe the brightest among the lot.
What I don't
Screen response to touch is sluggish. I liked Redmi response far better. Did not expect this from Samsung.
Face recognition sometimes falters and fails to recognize.
Lots of useless Samsung apps which have no utility or use.
The auto brightness assisting feature takes a very long time to adjust and we have to wait in the sunlight a few extra seconds to let the screen become bright enough to be comfortable.

For regular Samsung users who're looking for an upgrade, let me tell you that this phone doesn't have standard Samsung features like Secure Folder, S-Secure, Samsung Pay (Mini) etc. and even if you want to install them, you won't be able to.

Battery life is good and with full charge and a heavy usage, it lasts for about 30 hours. Fast Charging doesn't seem much like Fast Charging after 50% battery is charged.

Android Pie works fine and there's no lag in the phone whatsoever, except for a few sporadic hanging occurrences. Front camera is better alone than the rear triple cameras and I frankly don't know why rear camera resolution is less; also dim light photography is quite below average from the rear camera.

4k recording isn't there. Also, the focus mode is sketchy and works only from a distance, not very efficient as compared to higher end phones.

Processor is average too, high performance games lag sometimes (even with 6 GB RAM version) and for some reason, the available RAM (even when not using any apps) shows only up to 2 GB, I have no idea where the remaining 4 GB is being utilized.

Best part of the phone is the internal memory that gives a lot to store, also the display is great and the colors really come out well. Also, Pie features like Always On Display, minimalistic icons etc. are a definitive add on.

Overall an above-average phone if you're not expecting too much from performance/processor or rear camera.

The M30 has a class-leading screen, which comes with the added benefit of further improved battery life - again to levels no competitor can match.
The Galaxy M30 is great all-rounder and makes a very compelling case for someone who doesn't find 3D gaming or camera performance particularly important. You still get to enjoy a very nice display and the outstanding battery life.
Pros
Exceptional battery life, okay charging speed.
One of the best displays you can have in the segment.
An ultra wide camera is hard to find in this class.
Good portraits, really nice selfies.
Dedicated microSD slot.
Cons
Plasticky build.
Unexciting image quality from the rear cameras.
No 4K recording even though the chipset supports it; no stabilization in 1080p either.
You can get a more powerful chipset at this price point.

I recently started using Samsung Galaxy M30 and I’m absolutely in love with that ! The gorgeous AMOLED display is what really makes the Galaxy M30 tick. The battery power on the Samsung Galaxy M30 is totally outstanding!! And how can I forget my most favourite thing which is camera , I just can’t stop clicking pictures from the auto focus mode! Also specially love the fact that their are two SIM card slots plus as memory card slot ! After a lot of bad experience from other brands this has absolutely become my favourite!! You guys are going to love this phone and would not want to switch thereafter.

My last phone was Randi note5 pro
After that I purchase note7 pro
I purchase this for my brother and after one day use I gave him my note 7 pro and keep it
This time Samsung rocks
Phone is excellent in this price range
Pros- amazing display those who spend more time on YouTube and videos it's more than perfect
Battery is excellent 2 days use in single charge
No lagging
Camera is better than fake Chinese brands who depends on mega pixels
Wide angle is useful
Cons- back side of phone need cover or lamination because it got scratches

In my opinion if I want a perfect combination of power, display and camera than blindly go for it.
And one thing most important this is not Chinese brand this is Korean and this brand doing more gd work 4 India as Samsung established biggest phone manufacturing unit in noida. So love Samsung 4 this and made in India phone.

"The Galaxy M30 is a great phone for me! Love the gradient design on its rear panel!
When the Samsung M30 phone launched on Amazon ,the sale went crazy, everybody wanted to buy this phone because it gives you so many features aat just 17,990. The phone has a really magnificent look with a 6.4 inch screen .The right edge hosts the power and volume buttons, which provide nice feedback. The left edge of the Samsung Galaxy M30 houses the SIM tray (Nano + Nano) with a microSD card slot, while the bottom edge features the speaker, USB Type-C port, and 3.5mm headphone jack.
The smartphone is powered by 1.8 GHz Octa core Exynos 7904 Processor. A 6GB of RAM &amp; Mali-G71 MP2 graphics processor which ensures the phone to run smoothly without any lag ,so high end gaming users this is a surely good. When you talk about the battery it has a fantastic 5000mah battery life and to accompany this it supports fast charging so within no time your battery is powered up which then gives it a healthy backup for hours. In terms of the camera it packs a triple rear camera set-up with a 13-megapixel primary sensor, a 5-megapixel depth sensor, and a 5-megapixel wide angle camera when you talk about the front camera it has a 16 megapixel camera which can handle selfies easily.
Last but not the least on the software side, the Galaxy M30 has Android 8.1 Oreo.It is a perfect phone for me!"

Samsung touch and screen are amazing, but even though 5000MAH battery is there it drains too fast not sure what causes too as I restricted all apps and kept GPS off and it lasted for 4 PM to 4 PM total 24 Hrs no video hardly played 2 hr audio and 1 hr audio and no phone call. Sim holder was too narrow even while pulling out I was scary that it should not break or else what will I do even u can't insert your sim ( this is a problem in my hand set not sure whether  this is a common)
Since now a day's people have mind set to recharge the phone by eod and hardly change their sim so I gave 3 star.  I ignored cosmetic  like back panel looks cheap plastic but  can be ignored if apply good cover. If you want to use a phone for a day long and don't  change  sim often this is a best phone you can have it

Bought this phone as gift for dad. Since I am an iOS user the ui that android offers felt quite different and I do not like it much. Phone does come with some preinstalled apps like Facebook, Galaxy apps etc which cannot be removed. It’s good as a secondary standby phone. The phone is not the snappiest but ok for everyday use. My dad does not play asphalt or do graphic intensive tasks so this phone is sufficient for his everyday normal tasks.

I have purchased the variant with 6GB RAM &amp; 128 GB storage. The biggest thumbs up is the battery life. With a single full charge (Requiring almost 2 hrs) at 8.00 AM , the battery has enough juice (65% remaining) at 8.00 PM with moderate number of phone calls and moderate to heavy internet use. The Super Amoled display is crisp and vibrant.
On the flip side Exynos processor is somewhat slower and a buttery smooth scrolling experience is somewhat missing. Camera quality is good. Overall, the phone is worth buying.

Product is very nice. It's worth of its price. People giving it less than 4 stars don't know it's all features.

CAMERA (+ve)
Triple camera looks nice.
Wide angle camera is awesome.
Rear&amp;front camera record 1080p FHD videos.
On front camera 16mp sensor, selfies are good enough to go on Instagram and other social media  platforms. Camera softens the skin tone a little bit (beauty mode default).Live focus is ok but nice as compared to others.

FINGERPRINT SENSOR(+ve)
Finger print sensor works very well and actively.
Face unlock very fast.

BATTRY(+ve)
5000mAh battery runs 24 hrs on single charge. On high power saver mode it extends to 3-4 days with limited usage.
It charges 15W (0 to 100%) in appx. 2hrs.

DISPLAY(+ve)
Display is SAMOLED Infinity-U display(not in other smartphones at this price).

Soft, smooth and sensitive touch helps to work fast.

FEATURES
Low radiation, Blue light filter, always on display.
Design is stunning.
Glass black gives it very nice look.

SPEAKER
loud and clear.Dobly Atmos for earphones.

CONS not splash proof.

After 1 month usage:
No lag for a second.
Lots of calls, mobile data on, all day and PUBGM for 30min and battery drain from 90% to 50-60% (30% only). Web surfing, movie online (2hr) and other uses.
It's better than Chinese products.
I recommend this product over others at this price.
I liked this product very much.

I just got the phone as the same in the model. I like  everything .Best phone. For a user like me,it is a better phone in my budget. Good packaging by Amazon. Well packed. No damages and fast delivery in the third day. Cool phone . Performance is good. No lags . Good processor. The camera works better than I expected. 16 mp front cam with live focus is great. The wide angle and depth sensor each of 5 mp adds to the rear cam of 13 mp. Good camera performance. Battery is 5000 maH. That is great. In normal use , we can use it for more than days after a full charge. Fast charger is available with the box. It doesn't even take 1 hour to charge my phone from 44 to 100. Fast phone.5/5for face recognition. Fingerprint unlock is some microseconds late and it is unnoticeable. Actually it is fast. Samsung provides super amoled led display in this range. The quality of display is awesome. The display covers more than 90 percent of screen. It's cool. The weight and size of phone is manageable. Slow motion videos are not available. 4k recording is not possible. There is less heating problems. Heating can be considered normal.Dual messenger /WhatsApp.. options are available.It has a slot which accommodates two nano sims and a micro SD card Also,auto brightness is present.Perfect phone .Brightness is automatically adjusted. It is a beast . I suggest you to buy it. Experience the m30....

Really excited to use the New Samsung M30 Phone as it is equipped with so many features. It has 3 cameras with a wide angle lens that will help me capture wide shots all in one frame. Really excited for the infinity screen now Samsung does too. Another great feature, would be the Android version that is Oreo &amp; also the long life battery which is essential for daily use &amp; work. The phone also has 6gb ram and finger print touch, Now that's impressive and the best part is that the phone is Pocket friendly considering all the features that are being provided. Overall the phone is great and I will definitely recommend it to others.

Guys y'all really need to buy this phone and see how it does wonders.

I'm writing this after more than 1 week of use .. this is the best one for this price..
Pros
Battery..  defenitly the 1st on the list
Camera.. i had doubts about the portrait mode initially... but took some outdoor photos and turned out to be amazing. Portriat on low lights may not be as good..  but phone cameras are not quite meant for night shots.
Screen ..  best in market.. Amoled
Have not faced any lag even after opening 10 to 12 apps together ..

Cons
i was using galaxy note 3 previously .. so the audio from speaker is not as good.  its the same loud and all ...but not as good.. but headphones output is just amazing compared to note 3
I dont play pubg or any other high graphics game to comment about gaming performance.

The phone comes with 128gb that gives decent storage. The stunning display is full screen and so detailed and precise. The triple camera concept is marvelous with amazing clarity beating the top camera phones or professional cameras in the market and same goes for the front camera as the selfies come out clean and makes everyone look so good. The battery life is the best thing as it comes along with 5000 mAh that makes it run through out the day and is beneficial during vacations as I plan to go on trips with my family and play PUBG throughout the day. All in all Im in love with my phone and if you're planning to buy a phone under 18,000 then this is definetly the best pick

After using 15 days with JIO network...Here find my review.
Overall phone profermnac is good.
Call quality and network quality is good.
Battery is very good can last whole day with heavy internet use.
Rear camera is very good in day light with good sharp image, struggle in low light.
Front cam is OK  OK...But video is superb.
You will definitly love Super Amoloed screen when u see ur lock screen or wallpaper.
No heating issue while playing Game like Clash Royal n other online games...Get little warm while charging.
Fast charging option is also good option in this phone.
Finger print and face unlock option is little slow takes 2-3 sec to open.
Waiting for Android Pie.

Have been using xiaomi phones for the past few years... Just wanted to try Samsung's new budget phone launched to compete with xiaomi. But really disappointed... Xiaomi is way ahead of samsung... As its much more user friendly. It doesn't have in built app lock facility.. We have to download it from play store. It's Screenshot capture function is way too pre historic(volume +power key pressing thing...)as compared to mi's three finger swipe. It's face recognition unlocking feature doesn't always work. It allows only three fingers to add for finger print scanning unlike mi, which allows ten fingers.
Though it supports fast charging... The phone doesn't charge so fast.
So overall not so happy.
But only silver lining is its rear triple camera &amp; good selfie camera.

Don't go for it, Samsung has badly screwed with Android 10 Update, With Android 9, I had it running so smoothly. I regret updating to Android 10. Just search in Google for samsung m30 lagging on Android 10, you will find many videos as well. Even opening simplest apps takes 5-8 seconds, calls are a big big problem. Truecaller already a slow app, is worst with this one. Save ur money, go for something else, redmi upgrades are better, go for it. :-)

THE SUPER AMOLED DISPAY IS AMAGING... NO DOUBT ABOUT IT...

THE 5000 MAH BATTERY IS UP TO THE MARK.....

AFTER USING A MONTH ITS CLEAR THAT DEVICE IS VERY SMOOTH... EXYNOS  PROCESSOR IS AWASOME...

THE TRIPAL REAR CAMERA COMES WITH WIDE ANGEL PERFORM GREAT SHOTS WITH FULL WIDE ANGLE... &amp; 16MP FRONT SELFIE SHOOTER PRODUCE BEST IN QUALITY IMAGES....

THE ONLY THING WHICH I M WATING FOR IS ITS UPDATE TO SAMSUNG ONE UI....
HOPE WE WILL GET SOON IN THIS DEVICE...

Battery lasts whole day, fingerprint sensor was really fast. Processor was average, it lags too much after several weeks. No issues occured in first month, but after that it lags too much while using (&gt;50mb) applications such as instagram, facebook. Also, pubg lags in low settings also.
Build quality was cheaper, made with plastic back.

The handset which I recently picked is the Samsung M30 6+128, Gradient Blue is really awesome. It's a bunch of good features in a pocket friendly handset especially since I'm a student and I wanted to buy a phone with my pocket money. The feel is quite sturdy and it looks premium. The color is really good looking. The screen is really smooth and dose not put strain on eyes. Gaming is a quite good experience on this handset as I plan to play PUBG throughout the day and I'm sure it wont lag due to the 6gb ram. Allover I loved it. I'm so happy to make the smart choice and pick the best phone.

I have been using this product for over a month now and for me the highlight of the phone is the battery and the display.

The display which is a sAMOLED display is simply amazing, I loved every second of every video I watched on it.

The battery is humongous,  I use this phone all day for shooting my YouTube videos, movies, internet, hotspot and easily I get about 10 hrs of screen on time.

If, however you game heavily or even moderately you might get around 7 to 8hrs of screen time as I dont game much on the device. However, I did try pubg on this phone, the phone ran smoothly on lower graphics, but when I played with higher settings the phone did show some frame drops.
The phone does not use a Snapdragon processor like the rest of the devices in the price range but over all the ram management and the processing of the phone is good so far.

The next feature I very much love is the fast charging of the phone,  as I already said the battery of the phone is huge and coupled with fast charging the combo is a must have, plugging in my phone for 15 minutes easily gives me  screen time of about 2.5 hrs which is amazing.

The only thing I DON'T LIKE about the phone is the camera.
Talking about the back camera, the primary camera is a 13 Mp coupled with a ultra wide lenses.
The primary came show the pictures a bit washed out, which could have been easily gotten rid of by a simple software, but even in the latest PIE update the phone recieved, the issue still remains.
The ultra wide camera in a phone is amazing featureto have,  but a 5MP module of the phone just doesn't cut it.
The front camera is a 16 MP camera and j use it for YouTube video shooting, but the footage has a noticeable digital noise.

VERDICT: Given the camera and the processor is somewhat a weak point of the phone, it's still a value buy if, your top most priority is a good display and an amazing battery backup. Not only that the phone has a solid build and a good speakers if not amazing.

lot of expectation and ordered same launched day. sAmoled screen and display size is awesome. latest android version. later i realized screen is not corning gorilla glass protection. no where mentioned and some tech reviewers told this is not protected display need of tempered glass. my old phone redmi4 2gb 16gb variant have gorilla glass I am using this for almost 2 years without tempered glass. still no scratch on my old phone. Samsung fooling us. apart from this phone is good. little lag in lock and unlock, end call etc. WiFi hot spot range is little than redmi 4 range. and camera is not good. low quality why need triple camera for this model? old redmi 4 has 13MP camera is better than this. if you need good camera shots buy some other model. I selected &amp; bought this for sAmoled screen, Display size,  full HD screen, triple slot and good brand for low radiation for this spec this price (Rs. 9999) is OK. if you need same features go with this. if you need better than this wait for redmi note 8.
Update:
1) after two week usage. battery life for two sims one for 4g internet one for 2g voice active. one and half day life average. I am used 80% mobile hotspot with 2 devices usage and no games.
2) battery quickly charge maximum 30mins to 45mins from 30% to 100% this is amazing.
3) Display clarity is awesome
4) no lag feel. earlier I mentioned..
5) macro camera shots are amazing. see the example photo..
6) kindle ebook, documents reading is very nice and butter smooth. I bought this size of screen for reading books also.

Samsung has made good product this time. Definitely value for money I can say. Camera is average. My 4 GB version is fluid and no lag recorded. Speaker sound is somewhat clarity and loudness lacks. In headphone music dolby atmos doesn't adds any wow effect. Very flat sound in headphone not boomy. Superb display with decent viewing angle. Super light weight compared to battery capacity. Battery lasts 30% at after 24 hrs of heavy usage. Fast charger does what it said. Overall very good product as per price for everyday life. Games not tested but definitely very smooth interference without lag.

First, i don't play game.
Second, my primary purpose of buying this phone is watching web series and movies through Amazon Prime Videos and doind daily  normal uses.
In Highest quality there is a option to download videos through prime videos is 1.8Gb/hr but honestly it will download only lass than 1Gb data in highest quality. The best part is you can play Prime videos in whole screen like which is not able to play in Redmi Note 8, which is also a full hd display phone.
In realme 3 pro the maximum download quality option available is 2.3 Gb/hr, so it download better quality videos as compared  to Samsung galaxy M30 or Redmi Note 8.
If your purpose is not watching prime videos than go for Redmi 8, yes simply 8, which has the best battery backup i have ever experienced. Lasts for 2 day through intense use.
You can't compare the video quality through youtube or a video in your sd card ( videos will look approximately same in all these phones) but when you will start watching online contents (Amazon prime videos,  Netflix  etc) then there will be a major difference between these phones.
Samsung M30 Android 10 experience after updates is very smooth. You can uninstall majority of preinstalled apps like Google play music, movies, books etc which you can't do in Redme note 8 and Realme 3 pro. There will be many advertisements in the realme and redme in there pre installed apps which you can't uninstall or even disable,but not in Samsung M30.
For daily uses 3gb ram and 32gb memory of m30 is more than enough i didn't experience any lag or hang,works smoothly.

Where to begin. It's been a month using this smartphone . Believe me guys I generally doesn't use to recommend any Samsung smartphone of this range . Bt this product just made me change my opinion for the Samsung smartphones

Pros:

Battery is remarkable it easily give u backup for one complete day with heavy usage . I usually get 30-40% battery at the end of the day

Dolby atmos gives total different experience for audio output if using bluetooth speakers or any headsets  I use boat earpiece. For better music experience use Poweramp music player

Display what to say about it. Super amoled at this price range is cherry on the top. Viewing experience is top notch .

Camera micro shots are superb amazing selfie cam does it job in the best way it can at this price range

Tripple slot 2 sims+1 dedicated SD card slot gives u opportunity to use both sims and expand your storage simultaneously

FEATURE LIKE APPS MOVING TO SD CARD IS BACK! I mean finally this feature Is back which helps u to free your internal storage more conveniently and effectively

Themes interface n icons lockscreen everything is so perfectly designed and user friendly n that too most of them are free. Not many bloatware apps and ads.

Cons:

Back cam struggles a bit can  n improved in further updates  but a simple advice try to use Retrica app it gives the best result with both front and back cam .u will definitely gonna surprise with the results  with the pics taken from the app even low light experience gets far better once used retrica app .

Audio output as in with speakers could have been better .

Processor is also an aspect where it lags a bit . But If u r not a much into high end games with great graphics u can go for it . Day to day multi tasking can easily be handled with the processor smoothly

Final conclusion : if battery brand and viewing experience is your priority go for it . Not for heavy end gamers tho camera experience can b improved by using the app mentioned above.

Thank you!

This age samsung phones are nothing, when it comes to feel and user experience. The time the phone was first unboxed, the touch felt hard,but worked without error. Everything else good, camera clearer and real like, clearer than redmi phones, amoled also was ok, definitely amoled, but not very bright and colorful display. The back of phone also was over heating,I called up customer service, they said install all updates, it might change . But even after that, overheating is showing in the processor side and full screen ,when one game starts. The touch problem could not be solved completely, as this was not a appreciable error ,but only weak response and hard touch. I never felt like playing any game with such a touch and poor power behind the handset. Tried all touch repair apps from play store, and reset the phone also, but this never comes to a new phone touch feel. Terrible experience!! Even many China phones do more justice to everything. Samsung phones are only a name sake top notch.

I made a mistake buying this mobile. So many told me not to buy Samsung mobile for its slowness and network issues, still I went ahead and bought it thinking by now Samsung quality would have bettered but nope. So many issues! First the mobile box had tampered, it looked like very old stock with dirty box. Then the box had only mobile and charger not even screen guard applied. Mobiles back is so plasticky and such a ugly looking! Only the amoled display is worth looking at. Finger print reader is so bad and slow, it takes a while to unlock or react. You doubt whether you properly kept the finger or not.
Is been 10 days and phone is ashtray slow. Screen gets hung when some app is open and you get a call. Also, it gets hung when you get a call and try to silence it by pressing start button. Sometimes you feel even touch isn't working but it's because the app reaction is slow in this mobile.
Good things I liked are amoled display, dark mode, customizations and some actions given to finger print reader like pulling down navigation bar.

Please dont buy this mobile, touch screen is not working sometimes where it showing working good in mobile checking app.

Network issue, and finally you can't return the product as they mentioned on product description return/replace.

They said ,install a app for checking the performance but in that app its showing there is no problem.

Go for other brand!!
and use Flipkart, there you can return without hesitation and get the refund immediately after the product accepted by delivery boy.

Flipkart is best..!

After 1 month of usage
1) Camera quality is very bad and Low light pictures are tomuch pixelated and blur
2) Sensors are not working properly. After taking calls screen will not lit up automatically, we have to manually press the button to screen on (This is very very bad samsung)
3) very lagy.
4) Touch sensitivity is not good and Some times we need touch 2 to 3 times.
5) This mobile is not worth for 15K. I have purchased by seeing the Samsung brand name but this phone is not worth.
5) Please think twice before purchasing.
6) Speaker volume is very very low. In side the house itself you can’t hear the music.
What is the use of purchasing this mobile for 15K. Basic phone functionalities are missing. Don’t go for this mobile. Go for Realme 3 pro or Redmi note pro 7.  Dear Samsung hope you will read the comments. Please don’t cheat the customers with wrong promises.

Worth every penny with a Samsung brand value.
 I have used it for 8 months now. Its a secondary phone for me  not as a main so purpose for it is for add ons like:
1. Navigation while driving off cities
2. All sorts of applications for online purpose so main phone does not get clogged for stupid pop ups.
3. Home camera vieslws
4. Any screen sharing home
5. Home automation applications usage
6. Other calls etc
Now i ll tell you:
Pro:
1. Perfect budget phone with top notch quality of Samsung reliability
2. Features are a class w.r.t samsung as known for innovations and users needs and friendly.
3. Camera i disnt find much good with 3 lenses when i compare it with samsungs own 2 lenses of s8+ which i am using. Its far low for me. Anyways its my personal openion
4. Battery is phenomenal. Easily last 2 days. You can count on samsung for it no matter what-ve reviews u hear. I am woth samsung for 10 yrs now. Never disappointed.
5. Screen is premium. Not like flagship but its definately a premium look
6. Performance is high class, flawless, lagfree, stuttering is not yet noticed, its plenty to ve 6gb ram atleast for nxt 2 years.
7. Keys are well placed on body.
8. Amoled is plus here with this proce tag. Those who cry for apple orange are juz fanatics who will not accept technology. So if you re from a vivid and real crictics who appreciate quality vs pseudo mindset. Then u ll not regret.
Cons:
Camera it didnt impress me much as a 3 lense. But for most of day to day and maybe high end it matches. I am disappointed on personal grounds
2. Speaker os waste. Too low. Almost all samsumg phone is same.
3. Back cover is plastic. Develops scratches
4. Screen also developing scratches. So buy a guard.
5. Battery time takes longer. 2 hrs or so have a power bank of you are away from power for longer duration as u need handy chargeer for longer time.
6. No fast charge.
7. Actually in this price range i can't complaint.
Final verdicts:
Go for it. It guarantees nxt 2-4 yrs

I recently bought a Galaxy M30 phone and I am fully satisfied with it. Thanks to the 6GB RAM, there is no perceptible delay in processing any command. Then there is the 128 GB Memory, which is more than a match for the videos which one gets very frequently on WhatsApp groups. The 5000 aAh battery enables it to run for two days without charging. Thanks to the C type charging cable, it gets fully charged in about an hour (earlier, I had to charge my phone each night, but sometimes I ran out of juice by evening).

Feature by feature, M30 is better than the J8 I was using earlier, but it cost me less than what I paid for J8 less than a year ago. M30 also compares quite well with the higher priced A50 which my nephew uses - the specifications are nearly identical, but the camera is superior in M30.

This phone is described as "Made for India" and Samsung seems to have done away with all the frills in terms of packaging - in other words, the box is quite flimsy. Apart from the handset itself, all you get is a data cable, a travel adaptor and an ejection pin - there are no earphones which used to be a standard accessory in earlier models. However, no compromises have been made in the specifications and the manufacturing quality of the phone itself.

On the whole, an excellent option for Samsung fans - the latest features and very good value for money too!

Phones memory is a big plus
Camera - ok-ish not suitable for photo lovers, front camera decent.
Battery - I am a moderate user holds for a day,
Screen - screen quality is good ,
Speed - there is a lag here and there but runs smoothly , not to the level of 6gb ram!!

Needs improvement in touch sensitivity
Light weighted easy to handle can be operated in one hand
There is heating while charging but not so noticible while using..

Value for money... Camera is the area to be improved

Not worth the price. Don't buy this until it's price is down to 10k. Even a 6b Ram couldn't make the use a smooth one. Wonder how apple and pixel survive so great with 3 and 4 GB RAMs. Except for the screen quality nothing is praise worthy.
The back is a fingerprint magnet. Speakers suck. Camera quality is a big time flop.. too much artificial image production..
Battery life is kind of Ok. This is a good phone if you want a large fullhd amoled screen to watch movies and yt while you are connected to a good speaker. Sad to have burnt my heart earned 19k with 18% Amazon EMI...

Hello from here ,
I m smaranika Mohapatra a regular customer of Amazon reviewing my newly launched Samsung Galaxy m30 blue  after using it for exactly 6 months (purchased from Amazon in March 2019 )
Here's the review
1.looks - it has a stylish look at the back I personally like the shady appearance of this phone it gives a classy feel when you use it !
2.the camera- front camera which is 16 megapixels and back 13 +5 triple camera has an  amazing picture quality
Trust me you require zero settings regarding to camera it itself adjusts it self the back camera is equally perfect
3.about phone - there are so many of advanced futures  which Samsung has added in this model
Such as smart pop up view, motion and gesture, multi window,  reduced animations apps while closing and opening,panic mode ,dual messenger,hide app etc
4.In general I really like the built quality of the speakers it is amazing and soothing which would totally change your listening to songs and video experiences
5. It supports type c cables charger basically
6.supports fast charging as well
7.nocth view of front camera gives more coverage
Not every feature of the phone  can be covered here you know it when you use
Till date I am happily using the phone without any complain !
Hope this small review is useful to all Samsung customers to be **)
Thank you and have a good day

1. Built and color looks premium. Appealing to the eye.
2. Camera is decent. It captures good pics. Do not expect something great. It's average.
3. Battery is excellent and provides more than enough back up. The fast charger actually charges the phone very soon and its great.
4. Screen is the best thing about this phone
  Super AMOLED nothing is better than it at this point.
5. 6gbs of ram makes it fast
6. Processor is definitely better
7. Ample storage
8. Finger print sensor is faster than other fones in M series
9. Samsung Brand value
10. Overall Excellent!

Reviews after a week of use.
Better than Redmi not 7 and any other mobile below 14ooo if you are not a game lover (I don't play games so can't comment on that).
Few observations:
1. Battery is best in the market, easily goes more than 48hrs with above average use. Regular surfing,  one movie daily, more than an hour video other than movie, 3 hrs call and 2 hrs music daily is my uses. it takes 2 hrs to charge from 5% to 100%.
2. Display is other best feature of this phone. If you are watching videos regularly, go for it blindly.
3. Camera may not be the best but surve its purpose. Triple camera in this price range is appreciable. Detailing is not very good but color contrast and landscape photos in daylight are awesome. Very good for natural and closeup photography.
4. Look is absolutely premium.
5. Other features like fingerprint sensors, face detection, touch sensors, sound and grip are good, no complaints.
6. Software can be updated immediately to android 9.0 with One UI core. In fact this is the first thing one should do before installing apps and personalizing.
7. Didn't play games but 4gb/64gb configuration with moderate processor should be good to play moderate games.

M30- Jack of all trade, master of none.
In a good sense..
Coz you dont need a cell phone which has only a good camera, or a battery, or fingerprint sensor.

Screen is way too awesome. Supports 2k videos playback. (I know i know u dont care, coz 1080 looks way too sharp) but still.
Speakers are loud enough to listen to (dont sell your music system coz this is just a phone) blues and jazz with pin point music amplification.
Camera is fine, it will not fetch you oscar but for insta and snapchat its way more than enough.
Slo-mo are super sick to watch and shoot.
Performance is like a retired racing horse.
(Atleast retired ones are trained than a wild one)

Conclusion:- its not a worst phone. It acts like a cell phone. And priced like a cell phone. In other words you will use each of its feature in a day to day basis.
(Not like other which has tones of feature but no place to use  eg:- gesture control, animoji,tounge and wink detection,3D pressure touch (you got the point, didnt you??)

What you feel and say if you have not got any CONS in a smartphone. Samsung M30 is that model. Samsung has really done good innovation with M30. The mobile is butter soft and fire speed. Here goes my reviews after using it for 3 weeks. I am always using a device experiencing it &amp; testing then only busying myself on the keyboard to write a "Review- A genuine review" so that it can help other customer attached to Amazon. This M30 is definitely a Total Paisa Vasool for your hard earned money. I brought a 6/128GB variant on a lightening deal.

Camera - (Check the image clarity &amp; crisp on the attached above image taken from M30 Autofocus mode) Average good color saturation and focus even Bookeh effect and Palm jesture options. This quality is more than enough for a daily or often usage. Don't expect a DSLR out of it ha ha ha.
Battery - Huge backup to run for more than a day. Thanks to SuperAmoled display
Processor - Ultra clock speed. Exynos is doing its job. As I played PUBG the most advanced graphic &amp; RAM tester game ever made.
Design - Super cool &amp; young generation style. Gradation look is something Unique from Samsung.
Sound/Audio - Dolby Atmos what more u want. Sitting in the crowded cab felt like Theatre Dolby experience crisp and clear+DUAL Sound effect of background+vocal speech in less volume you can hear all the details which I was missing in other smartphones till date. Even the Headphones earphones and also Speaker volume also too good due to Dolby Atmos sound engineering becos of this I felt comfortable in watching a movie over the Speaker which I never used with other smartphones till date used so far. The Bass of the Speaker u can feel it and on high volume also its not getting break.
Display - A unique MASSIVE FHD SuperAmoled on 6.4 inchs display (good battery saver known fact)
This M30 is Highly recommended. Buy and experience its magic performance then u will surely find my reviews true. Go for it don't think back!!!!  Thanks Amazon for fast delivery and the Seller for delivering me in a Good package. Buy today and experience smooth silky speed of Samsung M30.

I have been using this phone for almost 1 month ....and in this period i've discovered some good and bad qualities of the phone....first let me come to the good things about this phone....
1. Battery and charging : battery lasts very long....with a normal usage (youtube, facebook,whatsapp...everything necessary....only except gaming) it gives a backup of 1day 17 hours.... i.e almost 2 days.... and the fast charger given inside the box charges the phone fully (starting from 10%) within 2 hours....
2. Display : it allows 1080p video watching....
3.Camera: it is quite satisfactory...in the daylight...the picture quality (with out live focus mode....i.e. background blur) is stunning....and when background blur is on...picture quality is quite good....and it is not very much aggessive ....and it can also be adjusted manually after the capture....selfie camera is also very nice which comes with a screen flash....but low light photography doesn't give much detailing of the photo....at night both the cameras are so so....
4.Performane : for a regular usage performance is sufficient .... there is also option for miltitusking....2 apps can be opened at the same time....
Now the bad ones are.... (although i don't know whether these are the problem of this particular set or not..)
1. Face recognition : every now and then it cannot recognize the registered face...and some times it takes 3-4 sec. to do it...
2.Fingerprint sensor: doesn't unlock in a moment all the time . Sometimes takes 2 - 3 sec.
3. Earphone : no earphone is there inside the box.

Very good screen clarity, it looks very neat and appealing, Camera is very good, low light photography is excellent. Fingerprint sensor is fast and it has good speed which helps me switch between apps smoothly. Gaming on this phone is awesome and it doesn't lag while playing games like PUBG and NFS. The 5000mah battery helps me almost never run out of charge . The charger included with the phone charges my phone in a matter of minutes. The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone. I love it

After some years this is my another Samsung device.To be exact I have opt to buy another Samsung device after j7pro.The best thing is the display and the battery life of this device. It is a pleasure to watch videos in this amoled screen. Battery life is good no issues with day.Heavy users can get 1day easily and normal usage it can get easily one and half day or 2days(my usage).
But the major con for me when I get this device is the lack of secure folder or inbuilt app lock.Yes M30 don't have any built inapp lock as of now.I suggest to download Norton app lock from play store over other apps as it is from a reputed developer and also it doesn't hamper the phone(lag).
And please don't believe the so called reviewer everywhere saying this exynos chip isn't capable. It is capable enough to do what you need to to with a smart phone every day though I suggest everyone to go for 6gb variants if you are a game buff or performance  maniac.And yes it now run on Samsung latest one UI with android pie.just check the update after few minutes after you completed the setup process.
Hope this ultra long boarin review help you.Thanks.

💯This is my honest experience of Galaxy M3o

=&gt; Design
It has two-tone gradient finish on the back panel.From light to dark which gives a classy new look to smart phone. Phone is very handy without back cover .(9/10)

=&gt; Display
sAmoled display is excellent.It gives perfect light in night and day usage But I REALLY MISS Corning gorilla glass protection so i will give for display (8/10)

=&gt; Battery
Well , With battery life I am very happy. It has 5000mAh battery which last for approx two days with average use.ALso it has fast charging which help me to charge it in shorter time. Best phone for battery in this price range (10/10)

=&gt; Software
It comes with oreo , but I received android pie update same day when i received phone. It also have One UI which gives smooth use.( 9/10 )

=&gt; Camera
Rear camera is good , it perform good in all aspects as compared to other phones in same price range. But I am slightly disappointed with front camera. It has different colors then actual condition. Low light photography from front camera is terrible.disappointed with front caemra . score (6/10)

=&gt; performance
Samsung offers a good ui which gives excellent performance, have not played any games so no idea of games on phones, but normal usage is best in this phone (9/10)

=&gt;&gt; Special Features
It has some gestures like you can swipe finger print scanner to open notification panel.  it has new features which helps to use phone smartly, as android pie do not have multi window but with samsung ui you can use multiple windows.
=&gt; MY experience
This phone fulfills my need as I changed my old phone just due to battery backup. This phone has excellent battery back of two days which keep jucied up. Also it has fast charging and lag free experience. So I am Happy With purchase
If you are not selfie camera addicted then it will be best choice for this range.

Great phone my samsung
I came back after 8 years to samsung!

Guys I have bought this phone twice. Because the product I have received in the first time was very bad one. The battery is burning out quickly that is we can only use the phone until when it becomes full charger only for 4 hours. Also that the phone is getting very hot when we turn on the mobile data. After I returing the product I have got a product having the same issue. Very. Very bad experience with Amazon because there returing procedure of a phone is very big task. Amazon please change your method of the returning these type of product and please make sure that the product you are delivering is good.

For the points i brought this product are not satisfactory. Damn slow...this is my second week. Dont judge me..i am a software engineer and i have good sense to test technical stuff.

Calling functionality like calling n receivng is damn damn slow. I dont know what they have messed up with this. Tremendous slow and irritaating.

Battery is 5000mah but appears like 3000mah. Drain out in one n half day. What they have claimed does not match to.

Touch is so poor. I used mi before it had a good touch. Dont know most of the option i always been required to touch twice as it does not listen to it. But its animation shows that i have touched the option..crazy..it has a problem.

I have now been using the product for quite sometime and without a second thought I would say that it deserves a 5.0 rating because of the brand, quality, affordability, flexibility in using.

Pros
1. Great screen at this price range, outdoor lighting is well managed with adaptive brightness. Clarity is great and I would say better than Xiaomi phones, my wife has been using one.
2. Less adverts, I love this as it is a terrible interference in Xiaomi phones.
3. Dual Volte, Bluetooth, WiFi management is great. I have been using the phone for Duo Video Conferencing, whatsapp calls, etc. all work great without a glitch.
4. I don't know why would people talk negative about the camera, I felt it takes great pics, portrait mode works perfect with nice quality pics. Extended mode and Zoom is great, video recording is perfect. I felt the selfie camera is even better then the rear one. The triple rear camera does a great job too.
5. Simple interface, not too many bloatwares or pre-installed apps. Notifications menu and management is appropriate, never saw the phone hanging until now. I use VLC for video and music, runs great, you can extend it to full screen while watching Prime or Netflix. I like the dual clock widget, hope they increase it to three in the future.
6. Google voice feature 'Ok Google' works great. Fingerprint may not be as fast as Xiaomi phones but does a good job.
7. Battery is mind blowing, under heavy usage with 2 hours video, 2 hours audio and full phone usage under mobile/wifi data along with bluetooth connectivity it gives me 2 days battery time.
8. Simple interface, nothing to complicate things.
9. Sound is great, voice clarity and speaker are too good. Dolby Atmos feature is a classic option for Prime/Netflix videos with soft voice. Previously I used to have Pulsar to amplify sound, but you don't require one here.
10. Double screen touch works great to switch on the phone in the lock mode.

Cons
1. No. of Fingerprints that you can record are 3 and not 5 as in Xiaomi phones.
2. Default phone lock / screen shot widgets are not available, need to download them from playstore.
3.  There is no Infrared capability.
4. Processing capability may be a little slower than Xiaomi Snapdragon 666. I don't use the phone for games, but for professional and multimedia use, I don't see a huge difference.

♡Only one thing is good you will get proper notifications.

The phone is heating even on small thinks like calling or browsing.
Amazon Team did a test the found temperature 40+ °C on but they said below 45 °C is acceptable.
I will not recommend it.
I ordered on 2nd Apr, received it on 4th Apr. I request for return on 11 Apr, they dined for return or replacement.
But they will send technician on 15 Apr to check it then he will decide, that is the last hope to return.

Good product. It's made in India not made in China like MI mobiles.

CAMERA- camera resolution is good . Provides different picture resolutions. Many good features.16MP front camera is impressive, the quality of face gets enhanced. Light settings are bit low . LIVE FOCUS IS AWESOME
9.5/10

Screen- The best in class. More than 90% screen body ratio. Impressive. Like 4K QUALITY
10/10

PROCESSOR- It is a weak part. The phone LAGS SLIGHTLY while playing games like pubg even in medium graphics
7/10

STORAGE-sufficient
10/10

Build- Its sleek and stylish. The fingerprint sensor is also nice. The plastic body is a drawback and is PRONE TO SCRATCHES
8/10

SMART GESTURES-provides useful features . DOUBLE WINDOW IS AWESOME
8/10

BEST IN CLASS PRODUCT AT THIS RANGE
WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT GO FOR IT.

OVERALL SCORE- 87% (OUT OF 100%)

I have been using this for more than a month.  The camera closes everytime i try to use the 'Live Focus' mode. The problem has escalated. Now the camera often fails to work occasionally.
UPDATE : I had to take my device to a Samsung Service Centre and I got a free replacement of the motherboard for free. A plus point.

Samsung phones have all kinds of preloaded apps / bloatwares which users cannot uninstal. For instance, there is this 'Galaxy Store' although there is a much more efficient playstore in the google/android ecosystem. Why do Samsung think the users need this pathetic uninstalable Galaxy Store. They should have at least provided the option of removing it from our device.

I do not know about others but I see no reason why I should have a SAMSUNG ACCOUNT to operate my phone. All the services that come along with it are already there with a simple google account that I can use on all android platforms. I gave 3 stars in my first review but after using the phone for almost 3 months, I am now  giving a single star.

I am always Samsung lover from Guru , Galaxy Sii …… Galaxy J7 variants and this one... M30. this is the best model among the lot in the market. I was advised by my fellow members to go for other phone which comes at the same price. But I decided to stick on Samsung. So without any hesitation I go for this M30 model. And I was not disappointed. Though I don't have any fascination on Mobile camera, Still like to say that it is awesome. I feel no one can beat Samsung on this part, except iPhone. Battery lasts for almost 1 and half day with my wifi on most of the times. Screen resolution is also awesome. In single word this is a excellent phone at this price. thank you Samsung.

What's the reason to like M30 there are reasons 50
The main reason of my buying was comparing SAR values between different brands and found them to be one of the lowest and this almost made sure that I bought this product
Between galaxy y and m30 I used many brands but was never satisfied so returned.to Samsung and am loving it
Rear camera is good with a 3rd camera an extra feature to expand the picture ( but blurs the picture a little) but still good
Front camera is also better can take very nice selfie
Battery life is very good even at 24 percent it worked and I charged next day And also charges fast
Screen touch is smooth and screen size too good
Loving it very much
Fingerprint scanner easy to use but have to store fingerprint scans to be able to use this feature unlike Redmi phones where if no scan is stored anybody can use to unlock screen
I have been using for around 4 months now and am very satisfied

Review after 3 months of use. Excellent smartphone for daily use. Processor is very fast. Fingerprint sensor is working very well. Recent software update for android pie and one Ui makes this device more beautiful and value for money. Camera quality is overall good but rear camera is not good for low light photography,otherwise rear camera performence is very well in daylight. Selfi camera is excellent. Battery performence is not up to the mark as a 5000 mAh battery. Sound quality and display quality are the best things in this device. Overall impressive device.

I am writing this review after using the phone for 20 days approx.
First of all i will never suggest you to buy this phone if u use phone more than 6-8 hours a day.
After using xiaomi phones i thought i should try samsung bt it was my biggest mistake.
In few days only phone started hanging as i am a heavy user.
Fingerprint sensor also responds a bit later.
The camera quality is good for day shoot bt at night there is no night mode feature or low light feature so the quality becomes worst.
Yes the battery of this phone is better than any other phone in this budget and the charging system is also good as it provides type c with fast charging modes which charges the phone's 5000mh battery in 2 hours.
Another good thing is that we get amoled display in this mobile.
So, overall if we see if u r heavy user then plzz dont buy this phone or any low budget samsung phone and if u r normal user then u can try this else u will feel regret

Build quality: plastic, where we get glass back at the same price in other phones like 7
Battery: serves the purpose.. even after binge watching for 6hours it lasts for 1 day..
Display: Excellent..super amoled with L1 certification... watching HD content is really worth the price..
No head phones..which is sad..
Sound quality when in call and through headphones both are better..
Type C charger..which takes almost 2-3hours to fully charge..
Camera: front camera is better when compared to its competitors like note 7 pro..
Back camera just serves the purpose..its just ok.. nothing great to talk about..7 pro is far better at this price range..
Storage and ram 64 gigs with 4 GB Ram..quite better
Processor:exynos...just does it work..not so fast compared to snap dragon 675 ..
No heating seen even after using continuously for 10-11 hours watching movies in Netflix..
No night mode and slow motion videos.. which is very pathetic at this price point.
No Software bloat..love one UI samsung interface with Pie update..
Very good at signal reception while I'm using jio and even the net speed is too good not sure about the other phones at this price point

The plus point of this phone is the display, ultra wide camera and the battery life. If you're someone who takes a lot of photos, and consumes a lot of media on there device then this phone is for you.

Pros:
-sAMOLED Display
-Ultra Wide Lens
-Battery Life

Cons
-Slower Processor
-Software (Samsung Experience 9.5 looks dated design wise)

Personally I haven't noticed much difference in using the AMOLED Display but this might change with time. One thing you might need to keep in mind (I found out about this a little too late) is the processor is closed source so third party ROMs development might not be there. They should have shipped it with Android P and the one UI which is more polished.

 If you want a phone for camera and media consumption then buy the M30, otherwise if you want a durable phone with better android experience and processor get the Moto One Power.

EDIT: After a week of usage I do not find the camera upto the mark, Images lack sharpness and they look a grainy when zoomed in even a bit. This was a huge let down as I expected this phone to have a better camera.

The best phone in the range, we could call it. If we talk about cons, I can speak volumes. The battery life is superb. For a heavy user, it will last for a day or a day n a half. Camera reflects professionalism. Quality pictures are no more a dream for budget oriented phones. Good for gaming too, as there is no heating issue. UI feels great.  The design of the phone is also a boon. The polycarbonate back mounted with triple cameras and the infinity U display and the sleek design makes the phone look great in our hands. About the display, i don't think we can get anything better than this. The superamoled display gets me mesmerised every time I unlock this device.
About the cons, i am yet to face them. No cons as of now.
Go for it, you wont regret.

I am using this mobile from 3rd sale on amazon
Just don't buy this phone
Because in this price range you can get better device compare to m30
CAMERA :- The camera quality on back is very poor and the wide angle doesn't take detail picture since it got 5MP but it take better selfies
PERFORMANCE :- M30 runs on exynos chip 7904 which is not suitable for gamers but it works perfectly for day to day activities
BATTERY :- Since it got 5000 mah you can use it for 1 day but it heats up very quickly
M-SERIES :- All M-series phones doesn't not have Knox means your device is not protected you should download 3rd party app to protect your data except M-series all samsung devices have this feature
After using 1 month you will experience lag issue

The Samsung galaxy M30 is best in this price range. This phone's fingerprint reader is 0.4 micro second slow than any other phone but this is not a matter to criticize this phone. This phone has super amoled display and the screen quality is very good. This phone has everything what ever you want. Really this phone is value for money.

My liking for a mobile is to get better response in communication . I do not care to use it as an alternative of XLR camera ,nor  to use it as a replacement  for smart TV . A good battery so that it can help me to do my essential job when I am out of station . Your this model I selected forthese reasons . Till now I have not used it as a substitue for professional camera nor watchng a TV show or movie.Samsung Galaxy M30 (Gradation Black, 4+64 GB) is helping me but I do not want to change my hand set frequently as that kills my time to make the new mobile user freindly

Loving this phone. With such great features. The charging port at the bottom is reversible Type-C and the SIM tray has a dedicated card slot. For a person who likes clicking pictures, 13 MP is amazing. It also supports Face Detection and high dynamic range(HDR) imaging. Also, you can effortlessly look through photographs and send messages on the 6.38 inches HD screen. Being battle ready with 4+64 GB memory and having 3X charging capability is what anyone would love to have. It is perfectly apt for consumers who prioritize battery backup above all else. There’s no denying that the Galaxy M30 is super comfortable to wield. Affordable, easy to access, and of one of the most trustworthy brand, Samsung Galaxy M30 is a must buy. If you’re looking for a phone with big battery and good camera, Galaxy M30 is worth considering. It is light weight with amazing display which can be expected from Samsung because it’s a brand which always has an additional feature to spice things up. This phone being available at just IMR 14,990 is surprising!

Well that's a great entry by samsung in mid range mobile segment. This galaxy m30 is exceptionally good in terms of Camera, Speed and especially Screen quality &amp; battery backup. Photos are crispy clear in daylight but, you should  not expect that same magic in night mode, talking about Speed it has an Exynos 7904 processor which is equal to Snapdragon's 660 to the some extent. The phone runs very fast, you can switch to apps very fast. The battery life is very long, one full charge can be use for 48 hours with moderate use. The Turbo Charger charges the phone Very Fast as compare to normal charger. The super Amoled screen does its magic  very well on your eyes as you would feel like using a premium  segment moblie. The new One UI Rom specialized for Samsung user is Simple, Interactive and Perfect to use with android's Pie. On a whole, THIS IS A GAME CHANGER FROM THE SAMSUNG IN MID RANGE SEGMENT.

Samsung has arrived. With M30 certain about one fact they have cracked the mass market.
Very Happy with the battery life. Nwould give a 6 star out of 5.
The camera perfomance is also great. The pictures of great quality for online publishing and with the prove point very happy.  The 6 gb 64 gb variant is a power packed version. Ample space and ram to parellel task a lot of applications and the display size and thickness of the phone makes it so much easy to carry and comfortable to hold. Just the placement of the finger print scanner on the back is a little discomfort with all appps using bio print you have to pick up the phone.
Over all value for money phone for all users especially student and workinv professionals

Everything about this phone is superb. DISPLAY- CAMERA - BATTERY - AWESOME.
thanks to its Super AMOLED display, triple camera setup and massive 5,000mAh battery.
Now after the latest update of ANDROID  PIE, the phone has become super smooth. The  1.8GHz octa-core Exynos 7904 chipset deserves a mention here.
I am a heavy gamer and also drive around 9 hrs per day using the phone GPS and Google maps.
The quick charger included with the phone is super efficient to charge upto 50% in 30 minutes.
The use of Finger print reader is brilliant.  Now I never have to key in my password everytime for logging in and checking out . My one finger print helps me in dozens of daily transactions across several sites and this is amazing using only my fingerprint.
The Camera setup too is good especially the wide angle lens, the HQ photos and videos also do not require lot of space for storage. (higher the camera MP higher the picture MB)
  My M30 is strong and powerful enough to last with me for next 10 years and I will recommend it for everyone.

I was using iPhone X and because of true caller I bought this phone. It was just to avoid spam calls I wanted to switch my calling number to Samsung. Rest all I use in iPhone. But trust me this phone has given way to switch from iPhone to Samsung. Next plan is to buy note 10 instead of iPhone high end. I prefer to use notes and camera in iPhone. I am not a professional photo taker. I use it for instant clicks. Samsung needs some settings for good clicks. iPhone can click anything in good clarity. Well this phone has very good battery life and speed is also good. It was good to experience Samsung with small budget phone and high performance.

The phone has Excellent Display, Battery backup is perfect to last the entire day even on high usage and also triple camera is cherry on the cake which enhances the picture quality!! Reading, browsing internet and watching videos is more pleasing experience on a bigger screen. The Face Recognition feature is so quick and effortlessly stylish. Slimmer phones are easier to carry and look more fashionable. Use multiple sims at the same time. It allows you to use two services without the need to carry two mobiles at the same time. Touch Displays offer a more interactive experience. Camera features are great and they offer image stabilization which really helps as I travel a lot and requirement is high, pictures in low light also come out pretty great. Overall, it's got new and exciting features some of which include face unlock, a gyroscope and a compass which makes using the phone fun and enjoyable!

well first of all it's not for gamers this exynos processor is trash. Second, sometime there is a crash problem for apps like youtube and chrome. I don't know whether it's the problem in apps or the phone. And yeah there is a slight problem of cellular range and wifi reciever. This model has some really bad recievers installed in them. It keeps the brs barely where other phones have full range. And it has trouble connecting to wifi from long distance where other phones get easily connected. Rear camera is good but we rarely use the rear camera for quality purpose. And selfie camera is good compared to the smartphones in same range like redmi note 7 pro.

Face Recognition is not so good on this phone, the device fails to recognize you if there is a slight change.
PROS:-
Amazing Battery Life.
Smooth UI.
Amazing Selfies.
Good Performance.
Works Smooth In Day To Day Tasks.
Looks Good.
Sleek.
Fast Charge.
Amazing Game Performance.
CONS:-
No Processor Upgrade(Same SoC as M20)
Low Light Camera Performance is not so good.
Portrait Shots are kinda just OK.

Overall, the device is good. It's an all-rounder. I'd say buy it if you have a budget near 16K.

When I Received The Box It is seal pack box I am very happy and confident that inside all parts are geniue and new.cut the all seal and open the box.When I opened it, I saw that the phone in which this plastic is wrapped is completely messy and it was very stained, the same was in the back side of the phone.I did not know that this phone was real or fake, it seemed as if someone dragged it or used it some day. the phone is working right condition, so I kept it instead of retrun it,everything is fine working on this phone but I am a bit sorry because of the stain behind it.

Smoothest interface and no lag in using heavy applications.
After hours of usage this phone won't heat up and the quick charger will recharge the battery in no time.

finger print sensors are very fast and accurate.

camera quality is something i will definitely like to talk about , triple camera with 4x zoom and wide angle camera with stabilization make it the picture perfect phone.

Go ahead , trust me you wont regret buyin it...go and grab your M30 today.

The phone seems ok . I think I should have waited a lil and got a good one for this price.  The camera is not that great .,

I have issue with network (Jio )on this phone , net , videos load late and calls take time to connect .
The same sim (Jio) when I use it on my lenovo  phone it's seems to be  fast and good
I suspect it's the M30 phone issue ( tried call possible setting with the help of Jio customer care ) no luck and no return policy also which is lil disappointing . Guess that money gone for a waste and now am searching for a new one / #waiting for Realme X , specs seems very interesting for that price range .

If you are planning to buy better think cos you have lot of other options for this price

The 32 GB variant was launched during Amazon GIF Sale. I bought this phone for my mom who use a light user. 32 GB is enough.

Fingerprint reader works fine. Camera is Okay but battery is unbelievable. The battery % was 48% when I took the phone out of the box. After 3 days of usage  only 30% of battery was lost. 18% battery was still available after 3 days. However,  phone was only used for calling and internet wifi was off. Still, the battery backup is really amazing.

Excellent sAMOLED FULL HD+ display (side by side comparasion with s9+ which hv quad HD+)
Sound quality is good but not too loud and dolby atmos is nice but only available on headphone not on phone speaker,
Camara is good @ this price point but redmi note 7 pro done great job here,
Ram management was excellent,but little slow/lag  due to exynos 7904 processor,but acceptable

Finally BATTERY,no other phones(asus M1,M2,RN7 PRO,Moto one power,oppo,vivo,realme series)can't beat this beast on this category even samsung A series and other M series(due to LCD) also,because of sAMOLED meets 5000 mah battery here.surely you will get maximum of SOT than anyothers.(one of the main reason to buy this).,
15W Fast charger is bundled(dont like RN7PRO),even flagship s9+/s10+/note series also hav same charger
CONS
SAMSUNG  R &amp;  D only concentrate on hardware,not on software,so don't expect the recent/current software updates on thier phones even on flagships also.,you could wait for several months to got the updates.
P.S: This all are my personal opinion...

Welcome back Samsung to my life. After using so many phones, I came back to Samsung with M30. Despite of other companies, Samsung is still the best for Android. Since I bought the phone, I never faced any hang or slowness. The screen quality is good for watching Youtube or other videos. Though, sound can be better but within this price range seems this is perfect combination of technology. Both SIM are 4G enabled so one can use 4G SIM in both the slots. You can also get a dedicated SD Card slot that can be used to increase the memory further with 2 SIMs installed.
The C-Type USB provided with fast charger is awesome and can charge the phone from 0 to 80 in slightly less than 45 min. The battery life is also very good when used in normal conditions (I usually do not play games) with Phone, Internet, Music, and Videos. With this type of usage I am getting around 24+ hours of battery life.
Processing speed is also good for any business use. I currently have more than 100 apps but the performance of the phone is unmatched.
The phone also work awesome with Android Auto where most of the phones (MI, ASUS).
Overall, I am very happy with my decision of buying this Phone.

The Samsung galaxy M30 is a amazing  Phone. The device has a super amoled 6.4 inches full HD + (2280×1080) pixels resolution. Battery backup is perfect to last the entire day even on high usage. I pay lotts of heavy gaming applications (pubg). The triple camera on the device is very useful to take background blur, zoom and wide angel photos which enhance the picture quality. It feels very great to watch movies on the bigger screen.  You can use multiple Sims at the same time it allows you to use two Sims without the need of carry two mobile at the same time. It has some bunch of cool features in a pocket friendly handset. As it is a very light weight device its very comfortable to hold it with one hand. Overall this phone is worth the money, I'd definitely recommend this phone.

M30 - 4+64 Samsung M30 is the combination of all the best features out there. To begin with the camera this time it comes Triple rear cameras, I really enjoyed using the wide angle feature because it is so much wider than any other cameras right now at this price, The live does a pretty good job while blurring the Background giving a really cool DSLR effect. Samsung is always known for it's display this one is no exception it comes with this really cool Amoled display with a Infinity U setup with amazing screen to body ratio. The battery in this phone is just amazing a 5000mah Battery which is enough for days easily. Overall very great phone at a low price.I recommend everyone to buy this phone. It fits in the budget and is ofcourse affordable

Samsung needs to workout to get their phones hang issue. I am writing this review within one hour after receiving my phone.  Phone started once but hang out later before completing android setup.  Somehow, I managed to factory reset but again phone is not getting on but stucked at STARTING ANDROID and not gettung off..  Now it's  almost 2 hours &amp; phone is showing same status.  I contacted Amazon Customer Service, who setup a techinical engineer to check the phone &amp; then they will decide if phone is faulty or not..

First putting this mobile on sale is the most bogus thing by amazon, seller n samsung. I received my order after 4days by Amazon delivery most slow not happy.Also package bag is little open but product is in fine state.

Now comes to product it is very average looking samsung phone.I have to setup it 3 times as in first go i setup quickly then ads came while unlocking it.
2nd time after factory reset when apps downloaded their icons not shown on screen.
So in 3rd attempt i got success in setting phone according to my settings.(very headache process)
No headphones at this price range and a small charging cable are again part of cost cutting for company n loss to customers.
You have to buy a good cover otherwise its a slippery phone to handle.
As for now its working fine no other issue...will update  further.

Thank you samsung for the awesome device.  when using the device..

Review this device 50+ days usage..

Its premium ? - Yes...
Its cool ? - Yes..
It's right cost - Yes...

Its come with us for whole day.. No need 2 times charging in a day.

Spot clearance when go thru finger print.

I'm not using Face unlock.. so no idea about that..

Love the One UI &amp; Night mode using this phone is a good experience..

except camera, everything is premium.. Hope samsung will improve the camera via upcoming updates. But it's not poor.. not average.. camera is mid-high.

Overall I will give 4.99 for 5
This 0.01 deviation is waiting for camera improvement.

Finally a phone that doesn't make me scramble for the charger all the time. The battery lasts a full 2 days even with slightly heavy use. The design is cool with a modern look. Despite the battery capacity, the phone is sleek - kudos to the engineers.

Phone is pretty responsive. On a few occasions I noticed that the fingerprint sensor takes a bit of time to respond, but only sometimes. The only con is the speaker audio if one is outdoor/noisy environment.

All in all - this is a total value for every rupee. Must have.

Updated as on 16 feb 2020 after 5 months of use
Pros: 1.Excellent amoled display quality and build quality.
2.Battery will last more than a day if you are light user, will stay whole day for medium users. Fast charger comes with the box. If you are an office-goer, half an hour of charge will last you till end of the day if you are a light user.
3. Camera is decent but not upto the mark considering other phones in the same price range.
4.The buttons are clicky and in place properly. Looks stylish in hand.
5. Less bloatware. You can uninstall useless apps.

Cons: 1.Fingerprint scanner's position is a little awkward for people with small hands.
2.Fingerprint sensor is laggy and inaccurate, even misses sometimes. I feel this is because of Samsung's software. Can be improved with an upgrade.
3.Runs on Android Pie out of box currently running on Android 10.
4.Poor processor. Samsung's interface is not smooth. Transitions from one screen to another feels choppy. I prefer Android one's cleanliness. I prefer to turn off all animations to zero in the developer options which drastically improves the transitions.

My verdict: I bought this because my priority was battery life, Samsung's amoled display and brand name.
Please do not buy if your priority is performance and camera, but it can still run pubg at smooth graphics without any lag or heating issues.
Now in 2020 you should go for M30s instead of this one.

Wonderful product so far! Haven't encountered any major problems so far. The phones is overall a good budget smartphone.
Pros-
1)Great Battery Life
2)Large storage as well as ram
decent processor (hasn't slowed the phone down)
3)Great Screen
4)Good front camera
all at a decent price tag.

Cons-
1) Rear Camera is not what you would expect
2) In my model specifically, the SD card didn't fit into the slot
3) Massive storage also results in longer loading time (sometimes)

Other than that, I think if you're looking for a decent, dependable and good smartphone under 20k, this is the phone for you

The main reason I have purchased this phone for the 5000 mAh battery, i don't think so its works as designed with specs the battery drains faster and the most irritating thing was it heat up too much the user in not able to keep the phone near ears, if you streaming any online videos and the you pick up any phone call it heated up in such way its not able to keep the phone in ears. only good thing is the display

Those were the days with Nokia, then came Samsung ...But it lost much ground to Chinese products ... Now again, I'm joyed to renew the bond with the Koreans ...Truly made in India  feel...Obviously they have rooms for improvement, but they have retained their character ... Great product at this price ...Super amoled screen is fantastic, next comes the lasting battery. But Samsung, pls provide prompt updates...You must have done market survey about the reasons for your loosing steam in the Indian market... 29.5.19 now after pi update M30 seems more complete phone at this price...Very happy with this..Samsung

Samsung M30 is one hell of a device which is useful for the millemals of this generation. It comes with a 5000maH battery which is a very long lasting one with 3 times charging. It has a very sleek and special Design. It has a 6.4 screen with 6 gb ram and shake down all the apps fast. It comes with a 13MP +5MP primary camera and 16MP front camera.It has rear finger print behind in the back.The Galaxy M30 has the same The software experience is better than other Mobile phones. M30 also has a dual-band WIFI support. It also has a dedicated SD card slot . So overall comparing all the pros and M30 is a great choice for the price that it comes in. I'll recommend this phone to all.

Jhandu phone. It is just a hoax. It is so unfortunate that even after being so long into the business they cannot produce a good phone. They try to capitalize only on the brand name and look. The performance is as good as Samsung's internal team.

Bloody battery runs out within 1 day even if you have minimum apps and live in a Metro like Gurgaon.

Genetically Hangs on every given opportunity. I mean really Samsung can't fix this basic problem?

It's like wasting my time writing this review. Just buzz off.

What a phone this is Man... such a steal... this is really one big marathon runner... The battery life really is sooo long.... Using the phone round the clock and I still will have enough charge for two days... UI is clear and rapid enough for the chipset... This phone is all about simple and upto the point... The display is really great... You don't get to have lot of super amoled screens at this range... So, there isn't any reason why you shouldn't buy it. One of the best phones out there at this range....

Amoled screen looks awesome and battery is also great. The processor is fine as I'm not a heavy user and use the phone for social media, songs, maps,and some basic games, etc
However camera is a big let down of this phone. I have mi a2 and the camera on that blows this one away!
The photos from m30 come out blurred and low light photos are terrible.
If ur buying this for camera, stay away.
I have always  been a samsung user but this camera is really bad, almost all my photos are too soft or blurred except during day light.

The best and the most distinctive feature is the infinity -U display which makes the phone look absolutely  stunning. The triple camera makes pictures come to reality and the ultra wide feature fits all you require  in one picture. With Samsungs Exynos 7904 processor the phone works extremely  smoothly without any worries of multitasking. I can use the phone for the entire day and the phone  will always  last because  of the 5000mAh battery which makes life so much better than just around the charger.  With the sAMOLED display  every picture  comes to life with their amazing  colours. I never have to worry about the memory  as its expandable to 512GB!

This phone is just so perfect &amp; affordable too ."

My brother and I have gifted it to our Mother, and she have been using it over 4 months now.

Initially I was little skeptical of using it since previously I didn’t have good experience with Samsung device, but I fell in love with this device slowly.

The build quality, it’s look and feel in hand is awesome and my Mother have been using it regularly now.

Even the battery life is superb unlike Samsung’s previous devices. They have worked on improving battery life surely.

I would surely recommend this!!!

Undoubtedly, 5-star rating for this Samsung Galaxy M30 under this budget.

Got a totally defective piece at first and getting it replaced was quite a headache. Coming to the phone, M30 is a decent phone for moderate users and non-gamers like me. Camera quality is more than decent, performance is quite good while Display is absolutely amazing. But the most awesome feature of M30 has to be the battery life, it is like the Hulk!

there seems to be some problem with the M Series mobiles, i bought M20, it was getting rebooted by itself, so returned it and got the money back, then i bought much advanced m30, it used to get hanged, even in the boot screen it will get hanged, then got a  replacement, now this replaced one seems to be ok.
the camera is too good in this price, the mobile display is awesome, every thing is good about it, the battery back up could have been much better.
one more plus point is u can un-install/disable all the useless apps.
if there is any dilema regaring which one to go for in this price range then just go for it. but beaware i got this working handset after 2 trails in 3rd chance.

Like:
Screen and look.
Dislike:
Camera is okay quality.
Sound quality when you recieve a call.
Finger print scanner should be on the front of phone, not backside. It is painful to pick phone and find fingerprint scanner on the backside to unlock phone.
It's behaviour is very slow when you call someone or cut any call.
I hate using phone with covers and this Phone needs cover because phone backside grab scratches very easily, even you only put it on your desk.

What an amazing phone to use. Love the screen display the colour contrast and the way it looks, gives rich feels and the triple camera concept is just fabulous. The 64 gb option in this compact phone gives an amazing experience of a decent amount of storage option. The battery life adds on to the features to extend the usage for a longer period, during travel. The phone has colour choices that is black and blue, so you can choose according to your convinence. You will love how smoothly this phone functions and how beautiful features this phone has. It's worth the time and money. It is such a low priced phone but with such beautiful features

I'm sharing some of the issues I faced with this phone and some good things too, which might be useful for other users to decide whether they should buy it or not.

*Hardware:
1. Fully Plastic body feels cheap
2. Fingerprint works 3 out of 5 times and is remarkably slow (without vibration motor, so you wouldn't know whether it unlocked or not without looking into screen)
3. Super-Amoled display is amazing
4. Speaker is avarage
5. Screen has no protection (easily gets scratches)
6. Battery backup is superb (depends on your uses)
7. Camera is strictly avarage
8. Processor is just good (expected better)
9. Charging takes almost 2.5 hr to bring it from 0% to 100% (still called fast charging?)
10. Network reception is very poor (you get very low internet speed)

*Software:
1. It takes approx 30-40 seconds to turn the phone on
2. No good themes or wallpapers are free, you need to buy them 😷. See the screenshots I have attached (MiUi is far better)
3. You can't take screenshots or turn the screen off from notification panel (options aren't present, use hardware keys or activate assistant menu)
Also, you can't take long screenshots or edit them directly after taking (no doodling option is present in gallery app)

Verdict: A lot of phones are present in market with far better specs. Buy it only if you're a die hard fan of Samsung.

It is as expected from Samsung with high class features and it is a surprise that Samsung is giving it for a lower but reasonable price because generally the price is on the higher side as the configuration and specifications improve

Can't ask for a better phone in this price range.. The primary camera is more than decent in this category.. Even in lowlight conditions...Front camera is good.. though there's still noticeable pixeling.... most importantly the battery is excellent.. gives you enough juice for just over 24 hours with continuous online usage with video and audio..
But the best thing is AMOLED screen though.. Beats any flagship phone in this department... pair all this with a quick biometric readers ( fingerprint and face detector) &amp; Andriod stock UI (very light) and you got a winner in your hands...An absolute steal at this price point.... Go for it !

The phone looks great on spec. One problem I am facing is - I got this phone in India and had to visit USA where it does not provide 4G connection... I am using T mobile and they say the problem is with phone and not with their services. Seems Samsung has not activated the LTE service for networks outside India. There could be another problem, but at least I have to live with 3G network while other Samsung phones from USA do not have any problem. My earlier phone (not from Samsung) did not have this problem and I was on 4G network from T mobile without any issue. Hope this helps to someone.

I have purchased  it few days back,I'm facing problem while playing PUBG,if you are thinking to buy it and you think that you'll play pubg in this phone drop your plan to buy it.it is facing various problems
1) I can not locate on pubg map touch does not respond in that case.
2)I m facing multiple touch problems while playing the game
3)there is lag while playing when everyone using tha same wifi connection to play.(I thought Samsung m series will be different from old Samsung hang problems but I was wrong)
And the worst thing,They will not refund you(non refund policy) they will not replace it saying that is a third party application and they can't  do anything about it and advising
me to uninstall  it. basically I'm stuck and cursing the moment I decide to go for samsung m30. Please yo don't fall in that trap.
There is no option of giving 0 else I have done it.

Here's a detailed review of this phone :
1. Display - There is no arguing that this is the best display in this price point . The colours are accurate and the details are crisp . This is one of the strong points of this phone .
2. Battery - The phone will last an entire day even on extreme heavy usage . It charges pretty quickly too .
3. Performance - It'll handle all day to day activities and can run multiple apps smoothly . Although i haven't played any high graphic games on it so I can't comment on that. You can look up gaming reviews of this phone on youtube .
4. Build quality is good for this price . It feels good in your hand . It is a fingerprint magnet though - so it's recommended that you buy a case.
5. Camera - This is the department where it didn't quite meet my expectations or maybe i was expecting too much from it - IDK . In bright daylight it shoots great photos but fails to impress in low light setting ( same applies for front camera  as well as video shooting) . I find myself using the wide angle lens very rarely as it creates a fish eye effect and the image quality drops compared to the main lens . They should have included a 2X optical zoom lens instead. But none the less the camera is decent , just don't keep your hopes very high .
6. The speaker quality and headphone jack audio quality is good . The fingerprint reader is quick too .
Final verdict :

The reasons why I chose this phone are as follows
1. It has the best display in this segment and it's what i required .
2. I'm quite sure this phone will last way longer in  the long term than it's Chinese counterparts .
3. I personally don't like the user interface of Chinese phones - it feels too cheap for my liking.
4. Great battery life.
5. I'm neither a gamer nor a big camera person - so those two departments didn't matter to me that much .

If your preferences are the same as mine , you can go ahead and purchase this phone without hesitation and i'm sure you won't regret it .

This a very good mobile, screen quality awesome, battery life excellent, good looking phone. But there is some cons also. Ist one is face lock which is not reliable because this unlocking devixe which eye closed and 2nd one is camera  camera is good but lacking in clarity, captured photo is not sharp and detailed. Camera is just average. Overall good phone in this price point. You Can purchase if you have low budget and you want a great branded mobile phone. After sales service is excellent of Samsung. You can consider this mobile if you don't want to change your mobile in every 6 month. Samsung mobile run for long time without any issue.

Sturdy and good quality phone.
Battery lasts almost 1.5 days in heavy use( 4g on all the time, 50mails and reply, movies and videos for 3-4 hours, 3-4 hours of social media surfing and 150 minutes of minimum phone calls.).
Camera quality is good, panoramic,  lowlight and close up are excellent.. zoom work perfect. No picture distortion. (Uploaded few pics for you to check)
Panels are sturdy.
Face recognition and finger print reader are pretty fast and accurate.
Split screens and security features are up too the tee.
Samsung features are also useful.
VIOLA... Just upgraded to ui9 android.

Just buy these amazing super hit mobile instrument. Highly recommended.

This phone is not all secured valunrable for cyber attacks. This is my first Samsung phone which I bought as trail and error and it was horrible experience. On the first day of usage of this phone, my Amazon account was breached and money from Amazon pay was stolen. Apart from that, my linked (AMEX) card was also misused by used by hackers. There are alligations/rumors that ransomware attacks were initiated from Korea and I am forced to believe as I had a bitter proof as this phone is from same country. Better buy some other brands.

The Samsung has done a great job by making this mobile. The camera quality is awesome. The battery life is good. The charging time is very less it takes 1:45 min for full charge and last atleast 2 days. The Dolby atmos gives you awesome feedback after customization. The gaming quality is good but not best it doesn't lag but the processor is little bit slow. The apps runs good in background. The display and 16m colours are just awesome. The phone touch and fingerprint sensors are good. The phone is very good. The looks are awesome. The phone is best as compared to other phones at same price. If you looking to buy it then buy it. It worth the money you spend. Thanks Samsung team you have done a great job.

I ordered in 2nd indian festival sale  price shown is 9999. And also 1000 as Amazon pay balance and bank offer  . So worth decided to buy for 8100.  Suddenly i think of. I exchanged my old mobile asus zenfone  for 1500. So totally i get this samsumg m 30 for 6600.🤗🤗 I would say it is very worth more then a value for money phone.
I ordered black colour looking very shiny and premium but slippery.
Pros
The screen is massive 6.4full hd led panel very bright very punchy.
It has triple slot
Does not bump in  cameras like Chinese phones
Massive 5000mah battery with 15v fast charger in box
It is the same charger coming in samsung s10
Charging take nearly 2 hrs. No heating in charging. Even it has 5000mah battery it is very light in weight
It come around 1.5 to 2days for average user
The battery draining is very slow. Whole night with always on display it drains only5percent
Important ly it has always on display
Camera is doing pretty good for 6600price triple camera
Front camera is good
Its comes with one ui Samsung own ui its very smooth
Cons
The charger cable is short ..
For heavy gamer i think i does not do it
 Finally my point it is very worth to buy for 6600
Thank amazon.

Overall phone is good and branding of Samsung perfect. But the major problem that will never happened in any phone is network problem. M30 has a big network problem, because it has its own chip, that's not well tested and for avail in low cost phone Samsung ignore that major issue wit the chip of network failure. I am using the phone since one and half month and the problem is the network on this device is not stable in many areas, while using another phone in the same area with same operator work perfectly and the coverage is also fulk but with M30 coverage was not full and internet is not work properly.
2nd is the sount of mobile speaker is too low. You could not hear that loud an clear while you are outside or in home not that loud. So no proper network no proper signal no proper coverage we can't use this phone at all, it is useless because no proper internet access &amp; always carry a headphone if you want to listen properly.

Honestly, I've never really trusted "Samsung" because of frequent issues with the software and hardware from this brand. I've always discriminated Samsung for this, until now. I finally decided to give it a shot. And, trust me, this is THE BEST that you get in this range! I bought the 6GB+128GB variant and it works smoothly! The battery backup and charging time is amazing! I literally spent like 3 days using the phone on mobile data without charging! Camera is again great! Can't really fault this smartphone! And, the display! Oh man, it's Stunning! Go for it! You won't regret.

The Phone is very good but honest review after using for 2 days is important.

Looks:- Very Nice, Feels premium

Operation:- The phone performs well in day to day operation, haven't tested with any heavy game.
Battery:- despite being a 5000 mAh battery it will drain out in less than 24 hours if used massively for internet-based applications such as youtube, play store, etc.

RAM and Storage:- Ram is massive 6GB, however, the phone utilises about 4 GB at any given time, hence there is little scope to use any application that would require extra.

Charging:- The only upside is the fast charging feature which lives up to its reputation.

Final Verdict - It's an ordinary Samsung phone with a bit of special touch of Good Display and Extra Storage.

The Choice is your's Samsung is still far from what RedMI, Xiomi, MI, RealME, Honor and Huawei phone have achieved in short span of time.

Not worth the price at all, after all these year's of smartphones, it is a very basic expectation from the UI to be responsive and lag free specially at this price point. No matter how good the camera, processor or display might be, if the UI isn't smooth then the device will simply not be worth it. I want to return this but as per Amazon technical support app, this is working perfectly fine.

This is seriously one of the best phones in the market in this price range, we have so many alternatives right now available but the quality that Samsung provides can not be matched.
I bought this under an offer and got it for under 12,500 and the Display is just awesome.
The Super Amoled along with FHD takes away the crown and the Triple camera is one of the best. One of my friend also bought this upon my recommendation and they too love it.

Review for M30 -

Overall score – VFM Paisa Vasool – 9/10 – Phone@Deal Price score 10/10
side by side compared with K20 pro OP 6 Nokia 5.1 Samsung A9 pro LG Q6

Screen – 10/10 Super Amoled – super – side by side compared with K20 pro OP 6 Nokia 5.1 Samsung A9 pro LG Q6 – Screen is 10/10 same like A9pro which too has super amoled, the brightness and the dark blacks are uncomparable, heck its even better OP and K20 which costed 4 times the price of this – one word- outstanding – no one can beat samsung here

Cameras – 9/10 – front 16mp and back triple cameras do good job, for 8K price they are close to other 15-16k phones easily, k20 pro cameras are better for sure, but when you view the picture on super amoled you see such sharp crisp images again credit to the screen than the cameras, in same screen when i sent k20 image it shone even more

build quality – 9/10 – for 8K price its good, front looks premium with small notch and looks same as any premium phones, back is flimsy plastic due to which point deducted, though many phones have plastic backs including much expensive ones

software – 8/10, same samsung familiar UI software which is quite mature, has the regular samsung bloatware too, better than k20 but LG software is better and OP was best
cant complain much as its part of all samsung phones – will not get much updates – which i dont need anyhow.

performance – 8/10 – for 8k phone its great, doest lag in any work like browsing, videos, camera – i dont anyway play games so cant comment but i am sure it will lag with heavy games, neither i need that nor the price says to include that.

Overall 9/10 but for Deal price of 8K its 10/10 considering the most impactful thing of a smartphone is screen and this is the best out there, other things are good too.

Am I happy with the purchase – answer is a big yes, and great job by amazon to deliver it in 18 hours.

It is a fantastic phone for the price I paid. Excellent battery backup, triple camera setup, fast charging, smooth operation, great display, trouble free functioning, wide angle lens, excellent quality photos and videos are some of the features I liked. Low light photography can be improved.

Overall the phone is fantastic and so far working very well.

Very good display actually very good performance in sunlight,good touch sensitive mobile,more options but I am expecting 1ui update from Samsung as soon as possible, especially battery backup was too good it is extending upto 2 days at one full charge, good camera but some what less quality pictures in wide angle mode,can install additional camera apps for better cam performance, voice recognition level is too good, for day to day usage,and periodic game usage I prefer this mobile, one person who hates ads while using will conformly choose this mobiles.

General Review:-
I bought this phone for a family member and I did the setup and everything. As an iOS user, I thought the setup wouldn’t go as smoothly as it eventually did. Samsung, Sony and LG make really good tv screens, so when it comes to display technology they have no worthy adversaries(except amongst themselves). This phone has a glamorous look to it which at this price point is unmatched.
When you pay for tech, remember what your priorities are(that’s a life lesson too) and in my case this is quite important as it caters to the needs of my family member. Therefore, I’ll make this as objectively apparent for you as I can...

Pros:-
1. A beautiful and glamorous screen at this price point- This phone is meant for people who like watching movies and tv shows because of that 6.4 inch display.
2. The fingerprint scanner- It is fairly snappy.
3. The phone is user friendly- Setup, remember??
4. Dolby Atmos- it is powered by Dolby atmos which gives the movie watching experience the oomph that the user deserves.
5. Camera- Triple rear camera has 13MP+5MP+5MP lenses. In layman’s terms, the phone clicks good pictures in DAYLIGHT and with triple camera, the scenic view and zoom.. the pictures will profoundly compliment your Trips.
6. 5000 mAH battery- That’s a BIG Battery right there! It will last you an entire day and some more.
7. Fast Charge- M30 has fast Charge capability and comes with the fast charge Adapter and cable. Also, USB-C.
8. Looks- The weight of the phone, placement of the finger print scanner and the back panel looks great. The Back panel is plastic(but doesn’t feel cheap) and not glass but that’s good because you don’t see finger prints on it. It has gradience( the back panel goes from a dark grey to black)
9. The Sim Tray- It’s a dual sim phone and the tray has two dual sim slots and a separate microsd card slot. It isn’t that new cheap ass hybrid slot. I shouldn’t have to choose between memory expandability and dual sim features. The phone is expandable up to 512 GB
10. Front facing camera is great for selfies.

Cons:-
1. Exynos 7904 processor- The processor is backward and therefore, this phone is not for people who are dedicated gamers. (hint- Not suitable for that PUBG life)
2. Samsung Experience v9.5- it is a little behind than the fast growing tech times but I Liked it. The Experience was good(Badum tsss)
3. Night photography- It sucks!! Less than satisfactory.
4. No earphones- The company does not provide a free set of earphones. That’s a basic freebie.

Who is this product for?
- NOT a Dedicated gamer
- People who need to use the phone all day at work and don’t like carrying powerbanks.
- People who require moderate to high usage out of the phone
- People who like watching movies and taking pictures.
Other competitor in the same range is Redmi note 7 pro.

If you’re a Spec snob, this phone isn’t for you because it is for a person with basic requirements. For the advanced user, Samsung M40, A50, A70 are better alternatives but you’ll have to pay more for those. In this price range, this phone packs a punch. Buy the 6gb RAM version, it’s better.

The major reason for my purchase was the display. Samsung provides brilliant amoled displays at budget friendly price. As amoled displays shows more saturated graphics, i went straight into the display mode and changed it to Basic and this did the trick. I still get nice punchy colours appealing to eyes.  I was quite in doubt abt amoled at this price but then I found that it is a genuine amoled. Touch also smooth and soft
 Cameraa quality is far better than those within this range.
I found fingerprint sensor a bit slower than my previous phone but thats not a big issue.
Battery backup is not exceptional but its ok for mid to heavy user.
I have 3 gb version and didn't face any heating or lag or hang issue.

The major thing I m missing as compared to my previous phone is the android One OS. I find samsung UI less professional and out of trend. But as mentioned earlier - budget matters.
Decide accordingly.

Disgusting. My phone shows 2 stick network and struggling to open Amzon or any other site, need reboot for making data to work, this app from tech support is telling phone and network is working as expected. Proximity sensor doesn't work sometimes in call and there is no option for selecting the proximity sensor in app. Phone temperature is fine till 48 degree. Really?? Worst decision to buy Samsung phone from Amazon may be. No option to return defective items. Return procedure is such pain.

I have been writing this review after using this phone for the last 6 months.

Pros

1. Camera quality is good
2. Display quality is good
3. The look of the phone is good

Cons
1. The signal receiving quality of the phone is very bad
2. The LCD display screen has completely gone bad just in 6 months of use.

 The phone has fallen from my hand just once and the LCD has gone. I am very much dissatisfied with the longevity of this LCD screen. Please don't buy this product.

I have been using Samsung phones for a long time and M30 is by far one of the coolest phone. It has large screen and feels better to watch videos, also the notch is very small so that doesn't cover screen. It has triple camera system which helps in focusing and gives amazing shots. This phone is very light weight so its easy and comfortable to carry and because of my hectic schedule I don't get much time to charge the phone, but M30 has super battery of 5000mAh and comes with turbo charger that gives more charging in less time, also it is type-C which is good for mid-range phone.

SAmoled combined with 5000 mah battery combined with 15w usb C fast charge is seriously awesome..there is no glass protection the default display material is a form of hard plastic fibre,therefore the touch sensitivity is also low by default,after putting glass it become just fine,but nothing like old samsung J or A series (there is an option in settings to increase it though)..the body and frame is made of out standard plastic fibre and the manufacturing quality really low on these low budget series(including A 10's and 20's,I dont know about A30's but it is mostly in the same manufacturing batches)..not expected from samsung phones.. i remember i bought A7 2016 for rs 17500 and i was astonished that the body and frame were made out of alluminium and double side corning gorilla glass)..gone were the good old days now i guess if you want that type of quality you have to buy the S series..anyway i have put an really thick dual layer body cover and an 9H screen protector, lets see what happens..
agai, excellent display and battery but if you're a hardcore gamer then this phone is not recommended as its gpu's are slower as compared to the other competitors in this range,...i recommend the nokia 6.1 or similar hardware phone's with Adreno gpu's..

Superb product from Samsung. Besides having a reliable brand ( better than any Chinese) the Korean giant has shaken the market with M series of mobile phones. I own the 6+128 GB version of M30. It's great phone. Filled with excellent features. Other than gud processor and very sensitive finger print reader, I love its triple rear camera. Its wide angle view is amazing. Amoled display is great. ..and ofcourse the battery,  5000mAH is really doing great for me to go for long without charging.
After comparing with several hot selling phones of this price range and features, I found this the best !

The phone is very good for day by day normal use. A little bit camera quality concern because camera is not up to the mark as compare to other brands in this segment. Finger print scanner is super fast but face scanner is little bit slow. Battery performance is average keeping in mind 5000 mah battery.  My phone lasts only 15-16 hours after full charge. No serious heating or hanging issue detected after using 2 months. The most amazing feature of this phone is display of it. Lovely display. Lovely to watch video through it.

I bought this M30 and M30s by exchanging some mobiles which were 4 years old, thanks to Amazon for that.

Coming to the ratings

Camera: 4/10
Speed: 8/10
Display: 9/10
Audio: 9/10
Lag: Nope
Impressed? Yes.

If you have read my review for the M30s you would know what I wrote but anyways it’s a decent phone, battery is the main attraction in the house since my parents have very light usage so it lasts 4-6 days for them. Fast charging is 🔥

Please click helpful if you liked my review ;)

Don't buy this phone Guys because it is not Oreo 8.1 Samsung Experience UI as mentioned in the description but Pie 9.0 One UI Core which is pathetic in all respects n battery consuming. Oreo 8.1 Samsung Experience UI is far more better than Pie One UI. Convenient unique multi-window features were removed in this 9.0 One UI and Good Lock app along with all it's Plug-ins/modules which brings back Oreo features are not made available for this device in India. Also, in this Pie update with August 1st security patch they updated to Bootloader binaries '2' which made it impossible to downgrade it to Oreo 8.1 firmware which was of Bootloader binaries '1'. Now, what to do Guys with this M30, they ruined this phone with Pie One UI, no Pop-up windows from recents/split-screen, no swapping in Split-screen, no Good Lock app n modules, VoLte is not good, not charging fast n many other things ? I don't know what to do, I bought this phone seeing Oreo 8.1, now I can't return this phone because I exchanged it with my old phone which I won't get it back, Pl somebody suggest. I request Samsung to do the needful either by downgrading it to Oreo 8.1 or adding all the fine features of Oreo 8.1 Experience UI to Pie along with Good Lock app n it's modules, Tq.

Very good phone. Sleeker than most of the Chinese phones in the range. Amazing AMOLED display with curved glass. Definitely looks premium. Camera is ordinary, if you need a better camera then go for M30S. No slow motion recording feature. Turn ON battery saver and night mode feature and battery extends by 20-30% easily. Exynos processor is not bad. I don't play games on phone hence no heating issues observed while watching videos, browsing or music.

The mobile is quite good and handy. There are many drawbacks such as follows.
1. You can add only 3 fingers for biometric access.
2. Indoor photography is quite poor.
3. Battery performance is not upto the mark for 5000mah battery capacity. The screen on time is about 6-7 hours. Whereas moto device with the same battery give the screen on time of about 10 hours.
4. The bank panel gets dirty easily. Hence a cover is essential.

Only 5000 mAh battery is positive in this model.
Face unlocking is very slow &amp; fingerprint scanner is average. I'm not satisfied with its unlocking system.

Other specifications are same as other models of every brand.

Screen of my mobile is coming out due to low quality pasting near front camera.
3rd quality product I received from Samsung.
After 20 days using, I'm feeling heating &amp; hanging problem in 4-64 variant.

I am giving this review after using the mobile for 3months. The quality of Samsung phone has been compromised. I had visited for the service centre more than 10times after taking this device. They had replaced the mother board and battery because of continuous automatic restart. I started facing this issue after using the mobile for 1month and I went to Samsung service centre more than 10times then they replaced the mother board and battery. Now it's somewhat ok. sAMOLED screen is not that great also the  product quality is not good, my son dropped the device from 3 feet and the screen got broken, just dropping from 3feet which is unacceptable. So with in 3months I had to replace the battery mother board and screen. So I think there is no built quality anymore with Samsung. I don't have option here to give -ve rating so had given 1rating. I wish I had to give -ve rating for this Samsung device, I suggest better go for other mobile instead of this. Also the camera is good in another mobile in this price range.

This is the best option to opt for within a 10k price range .
Phone is awesome and finger print is far better than indisplay fingerprint sensor.
5000 mah battey is awesome but it takes too long to charge even with the fast charger.
The main thing is there is no headphones and no back case , Most of the phones comes with it but samsung made sure they would never add it for a 10k phone which is bad.
Display is far better than Samsung A50.
Verdict -its a good deal for the price range

Got a M30 today. Phone found to be defective. Display is not working. Camera lens positions are not proper.
Samsung should not sale phones without doing proper quality checks. Each product should be quality checked.
Bad experience after getting a phone in Sale event.
Requested for a replacement.
Again with Amazon replacement is a pain as there is no return policy. If someone want the phone urgently, it is not possible. Bad policy from Amazon.
They will send a technician after 2 - 3 days based on technician availability.
Waste of time.
Do not buy this phone.

My overall review is that the Samsung Galaxy M30 is a fantastic flagship to the Galaxy M series. It is priced well and offers some really good features including a Super AMOLED display and a 5000 mAh battery.
Samsung does offer best in class service and support which will help a buyers end decision if they plan to use the phone for a long time. Plus the added Samsung brand name may help aid the decision. Either way the Samsung Galaxy M30 is a compelling device, and if you are considering buying it, the decision of buying it will be a good one.

I previously had Samsung galaxy mobile, so thought of giving new M series a chance.
Display is quite good as its Amoled display. But Camera quality is not at all good. 16+5+5 rear camera just pixelates every captured image. Front camera is no better to rear one.
Battery drains fast if you keep 4G network on. It may not last for 2 days (even its 5000 mah) even you keep surfing.
Need to check the both camera at samsung service station as photos captured are very shabby.

Update post 6 months usage....

Back Camera became worst now, no clean images. Phone hangs now and then. Touchscreen faults sometimes. Need restart in every 3-4 days. Worst purchase ...

Bought this phone for my mother. After 3 months, she complained of heating issue and low sound. After two system updates, wifi and bluetooth stopped working. Had a similar experience with samsung s7 that i had purchased earlier where updating the phone stopped all the phone's functionality. Dont go for samsung.
Great display quality. That's the only thing great about this phone.

Worth the money I spent and also additional features like fingerprint and face recognition to unlock amazing and would like to share few negative points like front camera clarity or quality of picture is not like earlier samsung phones. I think you people copied Oppo/ Vivo which is giving very poor quality images. Hope you will address this case and take necessary action in upcoming models.
And I'm looking for fingerprint on screen rather than bottom of Mobile. And I have seen many of other manufacturers mobile has SMS organizer feature which Samsung doesn't have in any of the models.

I have not got any earphones with mobile which is again bad thing. I may buy outside but I will not feel voice quality and I can not blame earphone or mobile. And now you are sending SMS to win an earphone which is other manufacturers product &amp; giving it to your beloved customers only for 50 numbers.

Waiting for ur next model with expected features and earphones.

Very good product. Good battery life, works perfectly as claimed in product details. Value for money. Thanks to amazon for prompt delivery. No need to worries abot battery charging. Charges very fast just 30 minutes are enough to charge for full day use. Thin enough and lightwaight , small enough for day to day usage and big enough to comfortable viewing. Game play and video quality is good and smooth play. Very good as business phone.

It depends on what are your priorities..If you are looking for a phone with great battery life , a gorgeous beautiful FHD+ display with decent camera quality then this is the one for you.But if you are a serious gamer or multitasker then this isn't.I bought 2 of them ,a 4 GB and 3GB RAM models with both priced under 10k on offer for my family members and both of them use it mainly for social media and watching videos and for that use this phone is a serious value for money device..The most attractive feature  I feel is surely it's wonderful AMOLED display.Not only in its price range but even for the double price point you won't get such a beautiful display on a device..And it's 5000mah battery is one among the biggest in terms of capacity that is packed to a mobile phone.it can last for 2 days easily with average multimedia use and also it support s quick charging which is also a rare feature in its price range..It has triple camera setup at rear which will still only give average quality pictures but 16 mp front camera is above average.

Samsung M30 blue is amazing!

The face recognition feature is awesome.
The finger print sensor is very quick - less than half a second!
I love the battery life - it can take on heavy to normal usage. I personally use 5 hours minimum daily on my phone. Can go on for 2 days in the actual world.
The fast charging facility is a blessing &amp; saves a lot of time.

The picture quality is mind blowing considering the specs of display. You can read those in product description.

I used other phone brands before but there Samsung M30 takes the cake!

M30 is on point and the perfect phone for me.

Please read my review carefully. First two lines following this line were my review feedback after using the product for couple of days and the rest are added today (4th Sep 2019).

Much waited product. Camera awesome  battery lasts for 3 days for normal use. Superb display. Watched Amazon prime videos in full screen mode and simply it rocks. Fluidic performance.

My Review after using the product for more than 5 months:

Guys, I picked this phone after a thorough research and the tough competitor was Redmi Note 7 Pro. But Samsung won due to the careless fabrication, finishing and assembling of Redmi Phones. You will be first hijacked with lot of positive reviews. But remember, never ignore even one negative feedback. So, I was not bowled out by the higher resolution camera offered by other brand but chosen the quality over other stuff.  Let me come to the points.

PROS:

BUILD QUALITY: Never experienced any hanging or heating issues. Awesome Fluidic SAMOLED display.
CAMERA: Great photos are so easy to snap. Look at my samples. I am not a professional photographer and I am totally convinced with what M30 can do for me.
BATTERY: Whenever I take my car for long rides with 450+ KM distance for 7+ hours M30 always stayed with enough power to use GPS. It was the feat I was always wanted in a phone.
PERFORMANCE: 4GB RAM is enough for me to install all my needed apps and the phone is flawless. Apart from the built-in 64 GB RAM, I have added 128 GB SD Card. I will never delete a single file for couple of years.
SOUND: The voice quality, speaker volume and DOLBY ATMOS support are really great. We won't get this from cheap mid-range competitor phones or even from the closely competing phones.
MAINTENANCE: Samsung provided the OS upgrade to Android 9 with One UI 1.1. Security patches are released frequently.

CONS:
Though I am convinced with the camera output, I want Samsung to provide better camera with improved low light and dark scene support.

Overall it is a great phone.

First thing..  this worst quality  was not what i have expected from Samsung.. I thought Samsung was only company which can be trusted blindly..but I was wrong this is the worst mobile phone ever by samsung.. the reason I m writing this is its camera quality.. I had bought this mobile bcz of camera provided by Samsung in their previous mobiles but this  phone camera quality was worst.. if I wanted this type camera quality (effect) I should have bought oppo or vivo.. 16 MP front camera with effect which  u can't regulate, makes your pic whitish all time.. even oppo vivo phones take good selfie.. and term and condition that I can't  return my phone is worst service by amazon..

I bought this phone for my dad. He had been using a Sony device for quite some time and wanted to upgrade. This is a wonderful device for a moderate smartphone user who is not a gaming freak. So far, I am quite impressed with its camera, battery backup and voice quality. Camera in certain light conditions, gives quality that matches to One Plus 6, and my Samsung A9. The phone has a vibrant screen and nice textures that makes it quite appealing to masses. Some quick clarification: 1. The phone works on all global networks. Just that it should be activated on an Indian network. 2. The low light camera is just average, if you are a photography freak, better search for another device. 3. Call reception and call quality is above average, though I would not rate it as excellent. 4. Low SAR value, that makes it an excellent buy. 5. No NFC 6. Dual SIM with a separate slot for memory card, expandable upto 256 GB. 7. You may want to get rid of lot of advertisements that bother you if you sign up with Samsung community.

Phone is completely good
Merits:
1. Super battery life
2. Super back camera performance on daylight
3. Back camera Above Average photos also on night
4. Super front camera great performance on day and night
5. Great display
6. Above average performance processor  but no suitable for heavy gamers but can easily play free fire
7. No heat issue
8. Good sound quality
9. Finger print reader is working good
10. Low sar value
Demerits:
1. Video recording quality average
2. Plastic body but more durable than glass body
Glass body gives premium look but when it falls it cracks but plastic is better

Bought M30 last sale and totally disatisfy with the phone.
Cheap quality plastic built body.
AI Camera make your picture really artificial one. What a waste of money....
Display if its display called fullHD then we need to change meaning of HD.
Samsung's premium phones are only good one.
Plz do not buy any phone from online. Its better to go to store if they offer a same price. Atleast You can check and verify the specification offered is up to the mark or not.

Pathetic  product. Pathetic customer service. Handset heating issue. Temp always 35°C and above, even when not in use - kept all feature sand app off. Battery draining up in 15-18 hrs standby mode. Amazon service  are nightmare.  Reaching to them on Helpline is hell like job - hours of que. They are making  you forced to call again on other day where you need to narrate  whole story and you get false or undeliverable commitments in lieu.  Service  visit option is another mess n blunder.
Amazon why are you ruining  your empires? Why are you promoting  these sale sif you can't  handle after sales issues?
I am sorry Jeff bezos - your Corp vision is not in right direction

Received product in time.
Used for two days and found no problem at all . Camera is good low light fotograps also good and best part is battery backup even after very heavy use battery was 20 % at 8pm . No lag in gaming installed pubg and played for few minutes. Face recognition is also fast and responsive.

Just only one issue came of ads on lock screen after app updation which was promptly solved by custumer care after calling them . As per them third party apps like DILYFIT CALCULATORS PEEL REMOTE AND SOME MORE APPS are responsible for advertisement on lock screen . After uninstalling the dailyfeet app issue solved

Dailyfit app is preinstalled after updation it shows  adds on lock screen so please uninstall it and enjoy the new  mobile

Overall very good product at such price tag .
My openion is go for it

Mobile got switched off after initial configuration and not getting ON again. All efforts to reboot the device and make it On went in vain.  Wonder why such HW faults would occur from a reputed Samsung brand?

One of the worst purchases.Mobile has lot of issues.writing this review after 6 months of usage
1.Battery lifebis pathetic.
2.samsung will periodically send you system updates and if you update them,ur phone will not work properl(Hanging issues)and there is no option to roll back to the older updates.U have to visit a service center to get it rectified and they will delete all ur data and format ur mobile.
3.Face recognition is another issue...it takes lot of time for phone to recognise ur face.
4.Performance issues
5 Camera is ok..dont expect anything great in this price band.

pubj is note working smoothly because frame drop or maybe graphic &amp; wide angle cam is no useful at all because pictures quality gets shity whats the point if theres no quality in picture + body is full plastice it gets scratches very easily. butt selfie camera is good in quality and display is very smooth that's good but again the 2 points that i have mentioned is not good are the maine in the main features of a phone and needs to be good in quality and in advertisement of this phone those things are especially highlighted and they aren't good in quality which is little disappointing and hurting as well because 15k is a good amount and if you don't get a what you expect is little hurting looks of the phone is good but as i have mentioned earlier there is scratch problem it gets scratch so easily. yea phone has soom cool function like multi window function which easy to use and some other features also like its own theme store so you can give your phone a new look  in use every whenever you want live focus in front camera is good

The main reason to buy a phone is to make calls. My mom can hardly place calls via JIO or via AIRTEL. Samsung selling phones which have terrible reception problem and low signal strength is a disaster. I want to return it and get a refund. The reviews say that there is a genuine calling problem. I didn't gift this phone to my mom just for having fun with camera, and a huge battery life to watch videos.

Anyways you already know the specs.then let's talk user experience, which is spectacular. you don't know how useful the always on display to check the time without turning the mobile ON. since it uses a super Amoled display it's doesn't take much juice for the always on feature. Coming from someone who used a redmi for 4 years is felt so natural to use the M30...

Purchased the 6gb and 128gb option....overall phone is good...battery will last one day with moderate use.. camera (despite being three I.e. the depth sensor telephoto etc) ...is just ok.. face recognition takes some time and If you just hold you head it doesn't recognize .....the finger reader is very accurate....had a problem of screen freeze once and network not recognized on airtel...rest all good...do remember does get a bit hot with use especially  while talking....update after 2 months.....phone gives an overheating message and service center tells that the phone if repaired is  dead ..one of the most useless devices do not buy...

Perfect device in this range from Samsung. AMOLED panel, best in segment, but don't expect color accuracy to be as good as s10 or even A50. Brilliant camera. Good weight distribution, it sticks in your hand. Good build quality, the plastic back or screen remains safe after drops with a case and a screen guard. Excellent processor. Enough for most High end games on medium graphics. No heating at all, especially compared to Xiaomi devices. Great signal reception with dual VOLTE. Smooth UI. Only possible con would be an underwhelming battery backup of almost a day, considering the size, and a not so great fast charging which takes 2hrs to charge. Go for it! Best under 20k...

features are as expected. I was a bit sceptical about buying online, fearing damages to phone; but packing and delivery were perfect; so full points to amazon &amp; sellar. The other worry I had was about the specifications , however at its sale price ,it is value for money in the mid - lower range of phones.If you want an economical  workhorse and dont intend to use it as your superfast gaming companion - go for it without a worry!

Finger print scanner works fine but face recognition takes too long to work. Secondly I doesn't have that good performance, if u want powerful performance I recommend u buying redmi note 7 pro. It's been 3 week with this mobile and with my variant (6+128) and many 7-8 games (including pubg, shadow fight 3) it has not hanged or even lagged a single time in the system
U will be getting a ad free Samsung ui.
One thing which is itching me is the android version. I hope they will give a pie update soon as it's running the android oreo.
Coming to camera, Camera is overall very good. With a good selfie camera, u can amazing selfie shots though I wanted them to give all mo mode in video but they haven't so that's in the down side.
Another important thing is it's display and man that's the sexiest display,it looks soo good. And if u r movie marathon guy u are absolutely gonna love this phone with its super amoled display. It's shows black in its purest fork.

If I want to review this phone I will give a rating of 86/100

Moved to Android from iOS and getting tired after spending a significant amount on gadgets that gets outdated in few months. Went with M30 more because of the Samsung brand name, but I've been very very happy with the performance so far. Brilliant display, seamless gaming performance(PES), decent camera(smoothens a bit too much for my liking) but the triple cam works well in natural light and for wider output.

Best thing though has to be the battery. I hardly keep the phone down and it still lasts me almost two days. Charges in 2-3 days.

Not all too happy about the finish and color but nothing a case couldn't solve. In short, easily the best in the class. Strongly recommended.

The phone is really good ..
Pros-
1- Full HD Display,It  is bright, clear ..I love always on display.
2- I have used MIUI but OneUi is far better than that .Speacialy the Ram Management of Samsung is awesome ..Also OneUi have less Bloatware even u can uninstall them.Remember OS is the very important part of your phone You can't run hardware Directly that why we use OS ..
3- Bettery Life is great.

Cons-
1- There is network issue ..1 or 2 stick less by compare to other phones.
2- Average camera
3-Plastic Back

Conclusion -
I bought it at 8100 Rs ..this is one of the best option in this price range ..Even this phone is worthy at 10k price range ..

I bought M30 Black with 4GB +64GB @12,100 . Previously I was using J5 Prime which I had bought at 16000 4yrs back. Here is my review about M30 as follows
CAMERA quality both front and rear- excellent. FINGERPRINT READER works very fast. BATTERY CHARGES fast, but it doesn't run as long, as was mentioned in the features. Also I found SOUND quality to be not at par with my J5 prime, but it's ok. BODY of the mobile is not metal.SAMSUNG J5 PRIME body is far better than M30.
In M30, I like color contrast,  amoled screen, and infinity display very much, which is an upgradation for me at this price range, not  to mention,  I had only 5 inch screen in my J5 prime. Mind it there will be no ear phone inside the box, also it gives a travel adapter, which is very short in length.
OVERALL, M30  IS GOOD.

But main thing keep it very carefully because its build quality of display is cracked if the phone get down on the screen side.
Either this mobile phone is wow.
I recommend you all to purchase it.

(Surprisingly!) Great battery life! A total show stealer!

I exchanged my iPhone for this one and was unsure if I've bet on the right phone. And believe me, I'm not disappointed.

What I love about the phone:
1. Amazing battery life- I'm a big social media buff and like all millennials, always on WhatsApp. With the continued use of so many apps and notifications also, I only need to charge the battery once and it lasts 24+ hours easily.

2. Wide screen- the screen size is big and the display is beautiful. Clean and crisp.

3. Blue color- I'm not a fan of black color, so chose blue. It's a lovely shaded back cover, I dont even feel like using a phone cover because the original cover is so smart. Looks good when I'm holding the phone in my office.

4. Lean body- it's a very thin phone and tall. It looks smart and not old school.

5. Speaker and Microphone- one of the main reasons why I switched the previous phone was poor mic quality. And the mic in this one is amazing. Such a relief.

6. Camera- Samsung cameras are good and this one is no exception to that.

7. Fingerprint unlocking- the unlock panel is on the back cover which is easy and convenient. Works well. Let's me add Upto finger prints and recognizes them immediately to unlock the phone.

While talking on a call, phone heat up and I heard a click noise, I checked phone and found screen touch cracked. Samsung service center and Indian service head did not accept fault. Technical issues can happen in electronic items but service is worst in Samsung. Or I can say no after sale service is there. Samsung did not accepted fault in my wobble fully auto washing machine in which we faced severe deadly electric shock but they did not accept fault. At least outside technician resolved my issue. In conclusion,  service is not there once you purchase product. Its your luck if product works without fault but if any fault occurs, do not expect  service

It's been a month with the phone and am quite satisfied with the product. This is my first Samsung phone I am using and this cannot be comparable with my last phone (Moto G5s Plus). Moto was far better in build quality and other features. I sometimes do regret that why I changed my phone with Samsung.
Cons:
1) Annoying part: While in pocket, the phone open's WhatsApp on it's own, selects a message and sends it to some random contact or sometimes it captures few photos inside my pocket or sometimes it calls someone whom I have never contacted in years. This happens when you set "Swipe" as your screen lock. (Double tap to unlock + Swipe) Never faced such issue with Moto with same settings. I miss my Moto. :-(
2) On video call (4G), my phone gets heated near the antenna area. Yani, too much heat.
3) When I shake my phone,(simply) I hear a weird sound above the fingerprint sensor. (something like a lose screw inside).
4) Speaker sound is not as expected.
5) Processor is not at all good. It lags most of the time until you restarts the phone.
6) No slow motion video recording &amp; No EIS.
Pros:
All good except the above 6 points.

It’s my very first review after receiving the product. I still haven’t opened the pack because I became UPSET after seeing the label it’s only works with Indian SIM. That means it’s country LocK. People me who travels frequently every months , for him it’s useless because of country local issues. If I use this phone , I need to carry one more additional phone during my travel which I don’t want. So I don’t recommend this phone for frequent traveler.

Display clearity is too good. Has night mode aslo for cutting harmful blue light rays to eyes. Bettry is also good. Rubber back cover also looks stylish if we put on it. I have put Black back cover and one temperd glass total it costed me around Rs200. Weight after putting back cover is also so light. Most important is it dosent heat up on ears while talking. All One plus and other mobile gets heat up on ears while talking. And Samsung service centre you will get easily everywher if any damage occurres when accidentally dropped down or any. And any mobile get drops down somehow in our regular life as we are not that much perfect in handling. Think about your current mobile how many times you have dropped it down. So don't take risk of buying other mobile. Press helpful below if you found this review helpful.

This phone is worth every single penny I paid. It's an amazing phone.
Pros:
It's built quality.
It's UI (highly customizable), you will love it.
It gives a premium look and you will feel good using your phone.
It's battery is GOD level.
Also it's battery optimisation is very good.
Display is just awesome, it gives a complete infinity look.
Cons:
The camera is good but I expected something more from it. I'll give 8/10 to it's camera.
There is no slo-mo option.
There is no shutter speed setting available in pro mode, this is very disappointing.
I hope Samsung will come up with some good camera features in it's software update.

The phone is of good quality. The touch screen works very well even when I have a screen protector on. The dual volte works well. I have two LTE Sims and they work seemlessly. You can have 2 Sims plus extra memory.

The finger print sensor is at the rear and bit difficult to use especially if you have small hands. Also the phone does not have NFC.

The battery life is reasonable. However, if you enable location service it can degrade the battery more quickly.

Amazing screen/display, pure dark blacks, high resolution. The phone has decent speakers but could be louder. Has headphone jack (good). Though the fibre glass back can get scratched easily.

EDIT: After 4 months of use  the phone is still good and no cracks or anything till now. Worth buying this phone especially when you're getting a deal. Just do buy a cover.

Best part is the display!

EDIT: SCREEN IS FULL OF SCRATCHES, PATHETIC SCREEN QUALITY! Disappointed, never going to purchase a Samsung phone again.

The phone is gud design and gud features. But it's the processor is not good.  It is not suitable for heavy usage of mobile phone ,  the camera is not good. It does not have slow motion And  and blurring of image is also not good. But compare to m20. The m30 is latest model but comparing to the both m20 have gud features .  Charging backup for m30 is superb. And quality of screen is needed. This is the best budget mobile.  And we hope for the new update with rectifying the problem.

Writing this review after a week's usage. I live in a place which has frequent power cuts and this variant of Samsung M series perfectly gaps the bridge. It's battery back up stays sufficiently for two straight days with charging of minimal of 15 minutes in between. I use Netflix, Amazon and some kids games through out the day with no hitch of battery draining. Fingerprint sensor, camera etc are amazing. The only thing is the storage. Every downloaded app stays in phone memory though there is dedicated slot. If you're a user of varied apps, give a though before buying 32gb model. In short a good mobile for a monster battery!!!
Ps: posted a pic of internal memory after installing 17 apps.

On this budget Samsung M30 was so much better.

On this price, face recognition option coming. It was very comfortable and quick unlock.

As usually fingerprint reader also so better in this phone @ back side.

And another great features were triple cameras. Excellent image quality and stabilization. While using rear camera on live focus there is a background blur option available.  It gives you a professional touch to picture.

Almost all features and options, themes, structure of Samsung and everything is awesome.

At 15000/- this phone is best buying and worth buying.

Samsung Galaxy M30 is the best phone anyone could buy in the given price range. It's a cut above the rest.Unbeatable looks, stunning display, amazing battery life. The availability of type c and 3x fast charge makes it an easy fit in our busy lives. The 4gb ram along with a great processor and indulging display greatly enhances one's gaming and video watching experience. The 64gb internal memory which is expandable upto 512gb makes it impossible to run out of space. The presence of stock Android adds a lot of value. The triple camera makes the photos come to the real life and with the new ultra wide angle feature the whole class can fit into a single frame. The Galaxy M30 is powered by Exynos 7904 processor which makes it capable of playing high end games like pubg, asphalt 9 smoothly. Overall, the phone is packed with the best features which makes it win in all conditions when compared to other smartphones available in the market.

I love the phone because it meets all my needs. I'm a musician so I use one recording software and guitar tuner on it to record on the go demos or ideas. Other than that I use the normal social media platforms. Its cameras are good enough for me for my  Instagram live and photos plus I have a professional camera. The only drawback I have with the phone is that volume output level is a bit low and it is a bit delicate for me so I put a Kapaver military case on it. The battery life is really good, on a full charge it lasts me almost 2 days. At this price point, I honestly don't know if there is a better phone.

Sometime in mid 2016 i purchased Samsung J7 6 &amp; I fall in love with Samsung Phone. It's still smooth, sleek &amp; wow. Since im in Govt service, i further recommended Samsung for our in-service use and purchased around 70 Samsung phone. These Govt. phones changes hand everyday &amp; faces different handling pressure from different user &amp; even after 2 years, all are healthy and fine.
I'm regular on Amazon &amp; saw the ad of Samsung Galaxy M30. But what surprise me the 6gb ram &amp; 128 gb internal memory with 5000 mah battery. There is no question of comparing since its Samsung. I tried almost for 1 month to book my phone and delivered within 24 hours.
Galaxy M30 has everything what some of 40K android phone offers. Look-&gt; Sexy for all angle, Speed-&gt; It can beat anybody, Power-&gt; Just Imagine, It is there.
Samsung understands US better than anybody else.
Its a precious possession. GO GET IT.. FEEL IT.. U WILL SURELY FALL IN LOVE.

I am writing this  after  using  the  phone  for several  days. The 6 GB ram model  is not  really  very fast,  battery  life  is also  average. The  biggest  problem  is that  the phone  comes  with  too much advertisement. Every time you  unlock  it you will have to  navigate through  whole  lot of ads before  you find your app. This  was  not  my experience  with  previous  Motorola  and redmi note phones. Only  thing I found  good  is display.  Even the  much touted  camera  is only  average  consider to note 7 pro. Considering the quantum of add they sent to  me every  day the  phone  should  priced around  10k only. I am totally  disappointed  with this  purchase. If you  gone through any review on you  tube  like  myself,  you will not find this kind of remark as they  are doing  only paid promotion only. So please think  twice  before buying  it. Redminote 7 pro is better  and cheaper  than  this as I saw the same  with  my friend.

Good overall. Camera is ok and not very good, specifically the telephoto lens is not very satisfying but the colours are good.fingerprint reader is fast not very fast but reads most of the times. Battery life is 2 days with little to moderate use, i do not play games so not sure but videos can be played /streamed with good on screen time. With 3g ram i have not seen it hang till date.
 Overall i would recommend this product.

Bought this phone a week ago. Though it look good, I faced updation problem the very next day. I have tried updating but there was some problem with the software so I have to take it to the samsung customer service. After updation, I only got to use it for a day and the phone started restarting on its own. Initially it was once a few hour and then it got worse. The next day or I may say the next night it started restarting and restarting and restarting till the next day morning. I went to Samsung customer service again and what they said was the chipset was damaged. Till now it is still in service center. So if anyone want to buy, buy at your own risk and may luck be with you.
NB. I can't get the phone replaced as I was unable to identify the problem within my return period.😑😑😑

After using the phone for few months now, I will give it 3.5 stars.

Pro:
Good battery life for normal user.
Okay-ish charging speed.
Great looks.
UI looks cool too.
Wide angle camera photos are awesome. Even selfies and normal photos are good. Low light photography suffers a bit.
Face unlock feature is very fast and accurate too.

Cons
Fingerprint sensor is too slow.
Samsung's OS features like searching lags a bit.
Flash light is not so powerful and hence low light photographs are not good.

All and all good stylish phone. MI phones might be better than it in this range but for those who don't like to go for those companies (like me) this is a decent enough phone. You can get value for money.

Amazon delivered the product 2 days late even after me being a prime customer so that cost the product 0.5 on the star scale. Coming to the product, it is a good choice for the price range. It has a decent camera(s). The processor is fast and responsive. Fast face recognition,
good image stability and low light photography is decent with a few glitches. There is a minor heating issue at times. The only negative is the battery life. I have used a phone with 5000 mAH before. It stayed way longer than M30 without the need for charging it. To be precise with this huge a battery size that Samsung claims the performance is not as great as it should be. You will need to charge the battery twice a day with moderate use and no gaming. If you are to use it for PUBG you'll need to charge it more than twice a day. The picture and sound quality are decent as well but Dolby Atmos for sound works only with headphones or a bluetooth speaker. I also experienced a slower internet speed with this phone and network issues. All these cost the product a star. I have written this review after using the phone for over a week.

It is really good phone , one of the best that I ever had, at attractive price range,  I am one of those people who do not want to change phones that often so for me priority is the long battery life and good memory storage. Both things are fulfilled. Also don't forget that it is Samsung so all in all great deal.

All features mentioned are spot on. Excellent phone.

Pros:

Speed/long battery life/camera/fast biometrics/easy to handle/one handed functionality/crisp display/no bloatware/fast charging/perfect weight/fast setup/built in safety features. All 10/10.

Cons:

Box has no audio accessories.
Audio output of speakers—6/10. No distortion though. Bluetooth audio output is 8/10.

Overall a good buy at 13999.

I am absolutely impressed by the stunning display of the smartphone. Another impressive quality is its battery life....believe me once you charge the phone upto 100% and it will easily last for more than 24 hrs even if you use it extensively for 8-10 hrs. Though the processor is not at par with the competition but it does a good job in handling the phone. I have been using it for roughly 3 months now and personally I haven't encountered any major lag. Camera quality is good though the wide angle camera resolution could have been better, but still it's a nice bargain at this price. Overall, the smartphone is best suited for those people who do not care much about the phone specifications and just want to have a friendly device which can serve all the major functions of a modern era with ease. Also, hats off to SAMSUNG for finally reacting to the need of a proper budget smartphone and also for delivering timely android updates unlike the previous samsung phones in this price range.

First time Samsung bring something good by it's price range. It's really a very good phone on budget, face recognition is good and fast, Ram management is much better Then Samsung earliest phone's. With amoled display you get a great viewing experience of movie and game. Key factor is Telescopic lens in camera. Wide angle photo's make some swag. Battery life is good and USB3.0 gives boost charging so no more stuck to charging point.
At last if you want phone under 20K with brilliant design and cool look swag experience, just grab it Now!

Galaxy M series is at par with current trends in smartphone industry. Best alternate to Chinese phones.
Pros
1.Display-it rocks with super amoled display with notch, colors are very vibrant and are treat to eyes.
2. Looks premium with glass like display although it's plastic.
3. Battery life- large battery backup, started with 100% yesterday morning and still 12% remaining today evening with normal usage.
4.Finger print scanner is way better and improved, compared to my current On Nxt.
5.Upgradable to Android 9.

Cons
1.Camera quality is not that good compared to other cheaper phones like readmi and realme.

Overall satisfied with my new galaxy M30 4gb/64gb am/rom option it's high performance phone with small compromise on camera.

Too Much lagging, despite of 4gb ram. Battery life is the only very best thing. the face recognition is okay, but its the most insecure, opens even when your eyes are closed. fingerprint reader is too slow compared to redmi phones also, camera is also not much appreaciable. but over all its really really priceworthy., if you want branded.

Superb phone in all aspects only sound is little bit less if comapred with my ulefone armor 3 (also purchase from amazon on my other account). It is good sound is little bit less than ulefone but ulefone has tv like sound and 55k (now maybe prices dropped ) but yes i bought it coz my ulefone was 370 grm approx . This phone is light weight ,it has wonderful display (million times better than redmi note 7 pro ) Also it has many unique features . I am so happy that camera is fantastic. It beats my sony 21 mega pixel camera . I generally do not write any reviews but i am very happy . Just 2 days of usage . I don't know about dual volte but still it is amazing

I bought it (Gallaxy M30, 128, 6Gb) on 30th may 2019. Since, then it's working absolutely amazing.
It battery backups is 2days (eventhough, I use to play 30min game online as well as offline).
And weight is very light, faster speed, amazing touch sensor, storage is very very important that makes system work better(128gb).
I am suggesting to buyers to gothrough it.
If you want to buy in this range then this phone is the best.

After using more than three months finally got Android pie update. Most of the problem has been resolved.
Slow problem on basic mobile funtions are still there.
Camera quality is superb. Battery life is awesome. Usually battery lasts for two days using heavy.
No heating problem. The screen is constantly dimming towards yellowish look.
Performance can be improved by future update.

Low light outdoor photography is very poor even with flash,  secondly my phone is 4 GB 64 GB model which totally hangs when we are watching continuous movie and where in we want to switch application. Thirdly 5000mah battery is not much appreciated because I don't feel any difference between my old J7 3000Mah battery. Without always Display function battery last 20 hrs with normal use and with Always Display ON it last 18 hrs. Rest over all phone is good.

Best value for money. You won't regret ever after buying it. I had less expectations before buying it, but after unpacking, oh gosh. Feel so great. Everything is beyond my expectations. Every feature that I have wished for, are all there. In built call recording, device care, user friendly, easy assess to all features &amp; settings, everything included. Earlier Samsung phones had issues of battery consumption, but, battery &amp; saving modes are great. Highest RECOMMENDATION.

Overall a good phone with a decent camera. Difference between a 4gb or 6gb RAM is hard to tell as such. I faced a few problems before the android 9.0 update, the phone was pretty slow but have been working fine post that.
What I like about the phone is it's looks, sleek and blue comes in a dual shade which gives it a classy look. The camera is good. And the screen resolution is great too. The battery life is too good for a Samsung but again I have been using the phone for just 2 months with an average usage.
The face recognition lock is pretty slow and there are a few lags in the camera application and while uninstalling the apps.
Overall I would recommend buying the phone for this range because of the looks and the features overall.

I was looking to buy a mobile under 10k which is moderate budget for mobile not a days, overall it is nice below are pro and cons.

Pros
- Front camera quality is nice
- Batter life is good
- Overall look is good.
- If you are using the mobile as mobile rather than 24/7 entertainment thing then i think it is good for you.

Cons
- Back camera is not good as front camera, so mainly if you are the person who takes more selfies then it is good for you but if you do not take selfies then i think it is not suitable to you in term of camera quality.
- Bank panel is made with plastic which is common for all samsung mobiles, though in other brands like MI you can get glass on the back as well which is very nice looking.

After using this phone for Almost a month I can say I m fully mindblown . Battery life awesome n charging is fassttttt. Stanndby time n actual usage time is much more than expectation in this price range n segment.
Processor is decent doesn't lag.
Phone doesn't heat up which is plus point.
Phone is bit heavy coz of 5000mah battery but its understandable.
Security is awesome like face unlock n fingerprint n pattern etc so much secure.
Display is crisp for this price.
Camera 3 in back n dot moycg display is oomph factor.
N colour omg gradation blue I looved it.
It took almost 4 sales to acquire this one.
So to summarize "go for it u won't regret#"

This is an excellent phone only if value for money, multimedia content consumption and battery life are your priorities. Camera is not good. Processor is sluggish at times, forget gaming. But watching multimedia content is a pleasant affair with its amazing super AMOLED screen and fascinating monstrous battery. Chose it for utility purpose and it's a bang on my bucks in that regard

Just loved using M30. Samsung offered a budget but no compromise in quality for M30, that's what i felt after using it for a while.
1, Display : SuperAMOLED, that I've never seen in this price range, the difference between LCD and Samsung's SuperAMOLED is incomparable. The black is the perfect black, and each and every colour is crisp in SuperAMOLED. And thereby offering the Best visual experience and low power consumption. And also the display is bit bigger than most phones at this range, which is a good thing.
2, Battery life : 5000 mAh, more than enough. For an average user* it lasts 1day and a few more hours.(*depending on our use)
Gameplay, If you are an average gamer, this is for you. But if u need high graphics and smooth gameplay in games like pubg, asphalt etc, this phone is not fully recomended, But still, M30 is good for gaming. For the first time i played pubg in M30. Using gfx tool games like pubg can be played smoothly. So that part is solved.

And still the phone is light weight.

3, Camera : A Triple camera setup at this price range is awesome, the ultra wide angle cam is the special one with an average clarity. But the primary 13 MP and depth cam 5MP does the job perfectly.
The 16 MP selfy cam performance is also good even in low light* ( but the clarity varies with the light )
4, Sound : M30 offers High quality Dolby Atmos audio experience while using headphones, for both Music and Videos.
5, User Interface or UI : SAMSUNG'S One UI is the best, simple and peaceful interface in my view.
6, Fingerprint reader : Not only for unlocking the phone fast and safe, but it can also be used to scroll down the notification panel easily by dragging finger up to down on the fingerprint reader.
( Not seen in any other phone )
7, Sim and Memory card slot : there is a dedicated slot for 2 sim cards and 1 memory card, this specification is not seen in many phones.
8, Notification light : no specific led for notification but the flash light led or screen dimming can be enabled as notification light.

The product is average only Battery and Screen is the positive thing. The fingerprint reader is too slow to response same go with face unlock, processor is very bad in terms of speed. App loading time is long you can see the app is loading, lagginess is everywhere. Wide camera is too poor, quality of the wide angle photo quality is really poor.

In only about 2 months of usage, the screen got cracked after being dropped from a height of about 2ft which is not that much. This phone's screen doesn't have any sort of protection. I have other phones having gorilla protection and they get dropped pretty often by my kids and they are still fine. Please remember that if you are buying a Samsung phone then do buy an insurance to cover your screen as it's gonna break like a fragile glass. If possible go for Xiaomi, redmi who are offering gorilla protection even on low range phones. I did a big mistake buying this phone. Should have gone for Redmi note 7 pro

The device gets over heated while on call. The camera is also not upto the mark. Overall extremely unhappy with the Mobile performance. The device gets heated up to 42 degree, and the company says that acceptable norm is upto 48 degree. If that is the case then y don't you mention it in the product specifications. I am totally unhappy and regretting after purchasing this product.
Even at 4GB RAM, the device is pretty slow and very less sensitivity of finger touch sensor........ Amazon is highly insensitive to resolve the issue. Its a fraud. I am going to fight legally now...

its a nice move by samsung to place a nice budget phone.

though in specs it might not be comparable to readmi note 7 and real me 3 pro.

it has amazing display and slim, nice design, it looks like a premium phone than the above.

also these xiomi/realme have a unnecessary nautanki of falsh sales

which is just a gimmick

so prefer these companies like samsung.

One of the best phone purchased till date. I'm in love with the Samsung m30, especially because its a budget phone and provides so many great features. Talking about the battery life - It runs for almost 2 days with heavy usage especially when I play my favourite Pubg game. It doesn't even lag either which in return enhances my gaming experiance. I love streaming HD videos on Netflix and the clarity is phenominal. Talking about the camera, it captures beautiful images which can be easily compared to photos clicked on DSLR. The charcoal colour which I picked is the best and it has 64GB memory inbuild which helps me store all photos and videos. It's a great buy for everyone and I love it.

The product is really amazing, but the piece i got is defected, which keeps on hanging within one week of use.
The phone starts heating while i play any game, specifically the finger print sensor and the camera was also not good.
My brother bought the same phone in first sale, and he got a awsome phone.
But the working and the other things in the phone i have got is defected, i think.
Please resolve my problem.

Not expected that Samsung can actually offer such an awesome phone at this price!!!
Good  performance, More than enough storage (No MMC Required yet for me), Battery is like a horse of long race, Cool and smooth Graphics, Fantastic camera...
Using it since 3 months, i have hardly restarted it (In other phones restart was required because they hung up while performing heavy tasks and restart was required every 2-3 days).
I have much more to say, but making it short this phone is worth to buy even if you aren't looking for a new phone.
Thank You.

Type C port useful only for charging. You cannot use for HDMI output. So it's useless for me. Completely lost trust in Samsung. I've exchanged the phone. Battery life, camera quality is average. Finger print sensor works. However Samsung guys listen to the customer. Sorry but huawei has better features and reliability, including camera quality and battery life. Lost trust in you as a brand Samsung.

I decided to buy M30 after doing a research of 1 month.  M 40 may be better than this , but I gave preference to AMOLED  screen.  If you go through the speed test in You Tube,  the other products wins the game by two or three seconds..How many of us go for a mobile speed test with others???

AMOLED  is magnificent. Batterlife fantastic.  I am a medium user and battery last for 2 days easily...Picture quality excellent.  No Hanging issues...I was worried about the processor..but so far so good.  A decent product I would say. I give 4.5 stars

I am writing this review after using M30 4GB variant for 5 days. Display quality is amazing.  I watched a lot of online reviews before purchasing M30 and wasn't sure about camera quality but found it much better those reviews.  Front cam is very nice and Rear cam also gives you nice clicks. Only low light photography is average. Sound quality is also very good. Louder than Redmi note7 pro. Battery backup of 1.5 days for average user like me who is not in heavy gaming.  No hanging or heating issues. Curved design feels premium in hand. Dual Volte is good experience. Fingerprint and face recognition
sensors work nicely. Overall much better experience than what YouTube reviews told.

Battery life is amazing, though it takes somewhere between 2.5 and 3 hours for charging from 10% to 100%.
Finger print sensor is mediocre. Camera is okay.
Display is wonderful and I have been using this phone for a month now and I did not have any heating issues(if I do not use the phone while it is charging) and the phone does not hang.
There seems a lot of software bugs which hopefully might be removed by the updates. Like when you are having a phone call, and if you press end call, the call will get disconnected after 2 seconds and not immediately.
The look of the phone is really really amazing as it has that gradient finish, however, it has plastic body. For looks, it is 10/10.
All in All, in this price range, it is quite good.

M30 is a great phone with latest configuration and security features. The battery back up with normal usage went on for more than 48 hours and with heavy usage went upto 30+ hours. The camera quality is good and different modes are easy to operate. Overall a good buy.

This is the Best phone I ever had!
Picture quality, sound quality, face recognition is ultimate, even in total darkness also, it recognises me, which is very surprising for me.
I enjoys watching movies, match, t.v., listening songs, playing games, clicking &amp; posting photos, reading news, books or article on it.
&amp; Most important I can do my work on it, I can use Excel, Word also.
It allows me to install a number of softwares easily, keep my data safe. Easy to use &amp; handel.
Battery is excellent. Continue use, remain till 30 to 32 hrs. Most important safe battery.
Selfi Camera, Third camera, display is amazing. Amolded screen gives perfect view of everything.
Tough mobile. Dark blue &amp; black colour is unique.

Gifted it to my mom on her birthday and she absolutely loves it!

The display is phenomenal and the battery lasts 3 days. That's like charging only twice a week. That too with 4g network always on.

My next phone is definitely going to be a Samsung with super AMOLED display. When we keep this phone next to other phones, we can know the massive difference in display quality.

Other positives include:
RAM management- never seen it reload an app while switching.
Call quality- crisp and clear.
Audio- It comes with Dolby atmos. What more can I say.
Camera- is good especially with the wide angle shots.

I haven't tested this with any games and don't intend to do it either. Since my mom mostly uses it for calls, watching TV series and WhatsApp.

I am editing review after 6 months .

This is the worst mobile in my life I bought,tsome touh keys stopped working after 4 month. I tried to mange with limited keys, When I have taken mobile to customer care they had shown me subboard of Mobile and told water went near charging point,it they said  very very mild fungus.

They are calling this as liquid damage and charging 4700.

I don't go to swimming pool, no rains in last 6 month then how can water go inside mobile which is also near charging point.
 They are saying while washing had it might go.

I guaranty to  any mobile you throw water near charging point will not get water inside.
Samsung  sell faulty product, in my 18 years of mobile exo this is first such case, I never bought Samsung and never visited any customer care

A very good mobile at this price. However, placements of a few controls could have been better.  Volume key and power key could be on either side of the mobile or space between the two keys could be more. Fingerprint scanner at the back of the mobile is the most  problematic since one has to lift the instrument to scan. Face recognition is quite slow and at times erratic. So it cannot compensate the finger print scanner.

I'm less of a resource intensive user. This one is perfect for me. In fact the phone is better than what I saw in the reviews on YouTube. Actually the phone instantly updated to one ui, felt like it's Android pie out of the box. And the fingerprint sensor is snappy too. Excellent display. No bugs, no lag. Only downside I found is the absence of an option for scrolling screenshot. Unfortunately the phone came in a very poor packing. The device box put inside a sealed plastic sac. No cardboard box. No air pouches. Surprisingly the product was not damaged. Go for it if you don't play graphic intensive games.

I got this phone for my dad last week. The main aspect i was looking for was battery. I didnt wanted my dad to every other time charge his phone. And with this phone, i got exactly what i was looking for. Still early days , but it gives 2-3 days of battery back up while keeping mobile data all the time.
Coming to other pros, very sleek, light, big screen, and feather touch. Camera is pretty good, though i didnt the like auto editing function in selfie camera.
Only if they could have provided with earphones if would have been better. Also the charging usb cable given with the box is too small. So if you are planning to buy this phone, please get a extension box as well.
Overall rating 4.5/5

As usual the problem is Samsung’s chipset and processor, they use different/better  standards for Europe and USA, it gets hotter quickly and has got poor performance when compare to other brands of same price range.. it’s just waste of money and time

Well,I have completed 2 months using M30 and here is my breakdown of pros and cons of this beast:
Pros:
1.The best thing about M30 is the performances where I didn't see any lag so far.
2.The amoled display at this price is an icing on the cake.
3.The battery life is one of biggest saver for heavy users like me.A fully charged M30 will last for one full day(HEAVY USERS)
4.Some of the camera pictures I shot with M30 awe some of my photography fraternity.I used to carry bulky DSLR for street photography,but I stopped doing that as I started relying much on M30 for candid street photography.
5.Android pie upgrades make the UI very easy.

Cons:
1.The biggest cons is the fast charging claims they made.After 1 month,I realised it takes more than 2 hours to fully charge.
2.The charging wire is too short which makes me think to purchase another adapter with lengthy wire.
3.This is not a beautiful looking phone compare to xiaomi and other mid range phones.

Except for all these cons,I feel pros overcome and this mobile is a beast for any mid range phones lovers who feels to change smartphone every year.

I was excited about this phone as it was my first Samsung phone. I was using Mi max2 and that was a good deal but somehow I had to give it my younger cousin who was going to USA for stay. The fone was impressive looking and I like it but as I started using it, started missing my mi max. The battery was good but it seems there is a bug in it. The video doesn't run continually and same with video camera. It seems broken signal problem. I updated the software on schedule but problem persists still. The worst part is the taking screen shot. It has traditionally concept fone, pressing 2buttons simultaneously and what mi max had 3fingers magical faceoff movie touch and shot is saved. I am looking forward to see new feature fone from them. Heard positive feedback but the battery is 4k mah and i want 5k mah one. Thanks for reading. Not all that glitters is gold.

I felt so happy to have this phone with me, that too in this price range (I bought it for 14,800/-, 6GB RAM). I am using this mobile for the past 45 days.

So far, I felt good about this phone except for some adjustable glitches. Enjoying to hold this new phone from Samsung. I am really happy to review this phone up to my knowledge and what I have experienced with this phone. So, let's start;

DESIGN:
Samsung M-30 is so elegantly designed with the latest trends in their mind. That too in the smart budget phone range.
The body material is in plastic and it has a grand look with gradient color.
It has 6.4" AMOLED display on the front side with Infinity U notch and thin bezels at all sides.
It is light weighted, smoother, and thinner -  so holding and operating the mobile phone in a single hand is not at all an issue.
The power and volume buttons are on the right top side while the sim cards' tray is on the left side of the mobile.
The 3.5 mm audio jack, single speaker grille, and USB Type-C charging port are at the bottom of the phone.
A triple camera with an LED flash along with a fingerprint sensor is present at the back.

DISPLAY:
It has super AMOLED 6.4" FULL HD+ with 19.5:9 aspect ratio and 108X2340 pixel resolution.
This phone has a vibrant display, which might be due to Samsung's Infinity U notch with thinner bezels at all sides.
Its additional main display feature is its BLUE LIGHT filter -  safe to use at night, it won't disturb your sleep.
The display is not having any glare under direct sun rays due to auto bright adjustments.
The Icon frames and Double tap to wake up features are also present in the display which is easy to use on the go.

SOFTWARE:
It comes with Android 8.1 Oreo and upgradable to the Android 9.0 Pie operating system.

PERFORMANCE:
This phone is powered with Samsung's Exynos 7904 octa-core processor.
The clocking speed is 1.8 GHz.
My mobile variant is with 6GB RAM  along with 128GB internal memory with 512GB expandable memory.
This mobile has dual SIM functionality with both supports 4G VoLTE.
This phone might not suit for gaming purposes due to its lesser clocking speed, but best suitable for other formal uses.
There is a single speaker at the bottom with medium to fair audio output. I will enjoy kinds of music better with Bluetooth speaker or with headphones.

CAMERA:
The triple backside camera was awesome. The camera features as follows; 13mp primary camera with an f/1.9 sensor, a 5MP secondary ultra-wide camera, and a 3rd 5MP depth camera along with an LED flash at the bottom.
The performance of the camera was average and best suits for formal use.
I also felt that the phone is processing slowly after taking the photo to save that photo.
The front camera was good enough to capture selfies.
If the lighting is good then the images will be too good.

BATTERY:
The battery performance was quite awesome and I felt too good for this.
This phone is with a 5000mAh battery and a 15W fast charging facility.
Around 50% of the battery charging within 20 - 30 mins but the remaining 50 percent will take another 1.30 hour.

The people looking for a SAMSUNG mobile with great features can opt for this M30 mobile since it is packed with bundles of features like full HD, bright display, and 5000 mAh battery with fast charging technology.

Best wishes for your great choices.

Finger reader can be made more sensitive to touch. Camera quality is excellent. Battery life is good with around 100 apps installed other than system app and gives a 1 and half day battery life without any gaming apps. Phone slightly lags in some applications inspite of having high speed internet. Camera lags in some options but give good still photos while moving without any blurring.
Areas of improvement: sensitivity of fingerprint reader, camera lag in some modes, and other RAM improvements.  It doesn't make you feel you are using a 6GB RAM phone.

Pros:
1. Good looks
2. Light weight and thin
3. Goog battery life

Cons:
1. Finger senser is little bit lagging, sometimes unresponsive.
2. Screen touch is sometimes unresponsive. I have to touch icons multiple times to open them. This is some times very disappointing.
3. Camera quality is not upto my expectations

Issue with the device, volume too low not able to hear whilst on a call &amp; while also playing PubG cannot play without earphones as the phone has some issue with the speaker. Called Amazon tech support, they won't replace without performing a trouble shoot from their end waiting for the tech support to call &amp; no call so far.
It's very frustrating. I bought this phone only after reading the reviews on Amazon, but it turned out to be a nightmare.

Well, first of all, thanks Amazon for this fast delivery! Got it in time! Now, moving on to the phone itself, It fits well in the sub 15k budget range, giving you good performance, battery life, decent camera with a very good AMOLED Screen. Now, previously I have been using MI A1, which was also a very good mobile with Stock android, to be honest, I was a bit terrified to see Lockscreen ads in this device, however, update to android pie removed the issue. So, please update to android 9 just after getting the device. Fingerprint  is decent as well, I was having some trouble first, however now, it is good. Camera is very good as well. Atleast a notch higher than my previous experience! Images are crispy, good and have enough sharpness in them. However, low light imaging is not a very strong factor of this device. You will get ok photos in low light. Another reason I chose M30 was the big battery backup and it did not let me down. It sure is good, and lasts more than one day. So, if you are an average user, go for this device as it feels good and premium in your hands!

Face recognition not accurate...open with close eyes also.
Fingerprint sensor is also slow &amp; take time to response.
Image quality gud in outdoor but very poor in indoor &amp; low light. Need update to fix these things..
Amoled Display quality is awesome
Comporomise in build quality not as per Samsung brand standards.

Let's start by saying I am loving this phone! Three things I love:

1. Build Quality
2. Cameras
3. Performance and Battery

Let's start with the first point, i.e.,
1. Build Quality : The body of this phone is completely made out of plastic but has a good feel to it. It doesn't feel cheap and is solidly built nevertheless.

2. Camera : The Samsung Galaxy M30 has four cameras in total, three at the back and one in the front. The selfies are next level. You can also use AR emoji and beauty modes to enhance your photos.

3. Performance and Battery : ,Gaming is pretty awesome, You can play PUBG at high settings which is the default setting by the way. The 4GB ram also helps alot with multitasking and keeping apps alive in the background. There is 64GB of on board storage but this phone also comes with a dedicated micro sd card slot that supports upto 512GB micro sd cards. So, you don't need to worry about storage at all.
The Battery backup of this phone is insane as it has a 5000mAH battery, it easily lasts you for 2 days or more. This phone also supports fast charging so it will take you very less time to charge it and you don't have to charge it everyday.

What a phone, highly recommend!

I brought this phone 3 days before. 1st time review writing on online purchased product. cause I've losses because no one write like my type issue. Really good mobile  since  awesome camera capture and battery life. Still I've losses my display from drop of 2 feet from coffee table to floor. Even cloth  Matt floor not direct concrete. I've feel bad that display crack and not working confirmed with customer care that this not cover under warranty price may cause around 6k plus to replace combo of touch and display. Really if you smooth user without drop 1 time you can or elce wear some type of protector's to avoid losses. This is from my heart to no let other to looses there hard earn money 💰

Hi,

I have been using the mobile for a while and found that the camera is not working. Initially Facebook was not opening while trying to open from the notifications. I did not mind much and after the firmware update facebook issue got fixed and now when I press the camera app, it is not  responding at all.  I think this might be issue with the latest firmware I am currently in Oman and need to get this issue sorted by a Samsung authorized service technician in Oman and it is under warranty.

Please do the needful ASAP.

Thanks,

The Samsung galaxy m30 is  an excellent phone available at an affordable price. The fingerprint sensor/reader is working properly. The feature of checking the notification box jst by the use of sensor is a new and cool one which i liked.
The camera quality is also good and can be improved further.
There's not much problem with the battery life. Still in the early stage when i bought it, the battery used to get discharge too fast, but now its okay..but still i wish there should be some changes in its battery life.
Overall, if I say then this SAMSUNG GALAXY M30 is jst EXCELLENT

This is the best smart phone in this price segment which offers us best display and best battery and trust me that there is no competition when it comes to battery,charging and display. This is an amazing phone for normal daily use, doesnt feel great while gaming but i think the build quaity and the performance and class wise this phone is unbeatable.

Overall a very good phone at a good price point. Been using it for 7 days and absolutely no complaints till now. If you are planning to buy any other phone that has same features and costs 500-1000 bucks less, buy this one instead. I chose this one over oppo, vivo and mi phones of same specs but cheaper one bcos of 1 very important reason no one looks at. This phone has lowest SAR value. Lower the SAR,the less harmful the phone's radiation are to you. This reason itself is sufficient to pay a small premium.

Bad camera...triple camera is as good as dual....not a performer, Snapdragon 675 in Xiaomi RN7Pro gives 170K+ in antutu along with IMX586 sensor for extreme camera performance...buy this phone only for Super Amoled display as this is the cheapest Amoled option!

The battery life of this phone is absolutely mind blowing.
The front camera is not the best but takes decent pictures.
The back camera has good focus and the wind angle is pretty good too.
But if you're planning on buying this phone for the low light photography then it's going to be a complete waste of money.
The processor is a little slow. It's been a month since I've bought this phone and mine lags a little. The back cover of the phone looks cheap.

Guys, Samsung days are gone now. Dont buy these phones.

I bought this phone with alot of hassles because of sale event product. I bought  6/128 version.
Some major issues with phone-

Poor fingerprint reader.

Bad camera quality.

Phone has a lot of lag. Very slow screen transitions.

App store problem, apps doesn't update even with auto update. I called and try to get it solved by customer care, tyey told me to format the device, due which i lost all data.

Very slow phone. You literally have to wait for 5-10 seconds  after opening play store.

what is the use of 6gb ram when ph is so slow.

But only good thing is battery and large screen with no embazzle.

THATS IT GUYS!! BUY MI POCO or used Oneplus instead you'll be far happier.

Dont buy guys!! Samsung  is not able to give quality products now.

I have purchased Samsung Galaxy M30 through Amazon flash sale on 7th March and received on 8th March. Was very excited to unbox however upon unboxing the phone did not switch on. This is really very annoying. 😡😡😡😠

What kind of quality inspection Samsung does before packing the phone. There is nothing being displayed even though I know that the phone is charged and on, the display is dead. Didn't expect this from Samsung and Amazon India.
And now when tech inspection is done, Amazon is saying they can't replace and forcing me to take a refund and on the other hand conducting another flash sale but they don't have it for replacement.

It's a good looking phone,  good display, foot to watch movies and you tube,  decent specs,  and it does all the work pretty good , camera is good but still my 2016 s7 edge has better camera than this , even processor is not that fast or slick but it's ok as long as one doesn't use it to play say PUBG , sadly it doesn't support samsung pay or samsung pay mini, whereas j7 had samsung pay mini.buy it for daily use,  it's good phone for the price

Writing This review after 1 days of use.

Cons :
1. Good Battery Life.
2. Processor is quite fast.
3. Phone doesn't heat up.
4. Fast Charging works really well.
5. Fingerprint scanner responses pretty quickly.
6. Face recognition is amazing.
7. Unlocks the phone in 2 secs.
8. Camera quality is pretty badass for this range.
9. You can use two Jio SIM and also the Memory chip at the same time.
10. The slot for all 3 is pretty compact and decent.
11. Speaker Volume is pretty nice.
12. HD Display is overwhelming
Cons :
1. Changing pin is different than the general chargers.
2. You can't use any other changer for this phone
3. Little heavy (But that's okay)
4. No Earphones (which blows)
"I mean Samsung would give you an earpiece for a 1200 Phone but won't give with a 17k phone ( business strategy is guess)"

I would recommend this phone for College students, Blue collar guys and for people who don't care about playing too much heavy games.

I got this one for 16,990 from Amazon. On July 27th, 2019.

Buy this one and you'll be set for at least 2.5 years with this phone.

ONE LAST MAJOR ISSUE-
The packaging was really bad.
Seriously Amazon?? are you kidding me? Don't you know how to ship a delicate gadget like mobile phone?
Guys, Amazon used thin plastic wrapper with small thin bubble wrap around and sent the shipment. Those thin wrapper you usually get for small items like memory card, or pen drives or thin books... yeah that thin cheap plastic wrapper.
And if you can check other people's images It appears that Amazon did that with everybody.
which was really a low blow to the customers.
They should have shipped it with a hard cardboard box with those Air tight balloon thingy , idk what you guys call it.

so because of that thin wrapper my phone box was little bit suppressed from the top.
I was scared that it might have damaged the phone.
but it was okay.
but seriously Amazon, grow a pair and don't mess with people's emotions and money.
we pay you, you need to satisfy your customers.

that's all guys...
hope you liked my review.
Till next time.

Pros-
Go for it
I'll suggest 6gb/128gb.
I have been using it for more than 2 months.
I have 10 GB of different games but it doesn't affect the phone.
I have every social media app and all runs smoothly.
Processing power of the phone is really nice.
A phone with awesome battery life.
Cool graphics, beautiful screen and good looking mobile phone.
You can not get a better branded phone in this range.
Better camera than all the phones in this range. Better than all oppo/vivo phones below 20k. I can assure that the depth sensitive of M30 is better than oneplus5t.

Cons-
There is no inbuilt applock (does not matter)
Default setting in pubg is not so smooth so you have to put it on low mode (still HD).
Inbuilt game recorder is there but recording pubg creates frame drop if you play on HD.

Face unlock is real fast but not really secure.
Fingerprints works at lightening speed.

I have purchased SAMSUNG Galaxy M30 on 30/04/2019 (delivered on 01/05/2019) and using it for past 4 months. I love all the features and till date there is no complaint from my side.

The advantages of SAMSUNG Galaxy M30 according to me are:
1. Network - It remains stable most of the time, I use Vodafone and Jio network.
2. Body -  It's dimension is 159 x 75.1 x 8.5 mm and weight is just 174 gm, nice and slim to hold in hand.
3. Display - Super AMOLED display so no stains to eyes and smooth touch.
4. Platform - Android 8.1 (Oreo), upgradable to Android 9.0 (Pie); One UI (My phone is upgraded after 20 days of purchase) and Exynos 7904 octa-core processor never lets the phone slow down.
5. Memory - I use 4GB+64 GB device, I can assure no hanging or lagging problem even if you use it for continuous 1-2 hours with several apps running.
6. Camera - Triple rear camera (13+5+5 MP) with 16 MP selfie camera is simply awesome.
7. Sound - Dolby Atmos sound with active noise cancelation, functioning great.
8. Sensors - Fingerprint sensor is rear mounted and believe me till date no issue with the sensor, working pretty smoothly.
9. Battery - Li-Po 5000 mAh battery with Fast battery charging 15W, Full charge completes within 1.5 hours if you put charge at 15% battery remaining and trust my according my usage it stays for whole 2 days after normal usage of device.
10. Miscellaneous - Wi-Fi 802.11, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS is there, FM Radio with recording, USB 2.0 Type-C with reversible connector and most important SAR of galaxy M30 is 0.41 W/kg (Low radiation)

After using it for about 4 months it's all well and simply amazing.
Thank you SAMSUNG and AMAZON for making my life awesome.

Good device with both Cons &amp; Pros

Good looking device and feels good in hand. Though the size is big can be comfortably hold in one hand with out slippery.
I'm Not much into gaming, but very decent performance for everyday use.
Display is brilliant. But Auto Bright sensor is not upto the mark.
Primary &amp; Depth sensor camera is very good and wide angle sensor could ave been much better, image looks very distorted even in normal view. Front camera performance is good
No Heat issue.
Battery backup comes upto 2 days in normal use with Mobile Data+ Wi Fi always on. With heavy use like navigation, Bluetooth calling, Audio the battery backup easily lasts up to 1 day.
Device takes upto 1 hr to charge completely.

Pros..
Whats not?
Triple cam with 1 telephoto
Heres a hint download google cam v 4.4 it works perfectly and produces life like photos......
Stock camera....cant say much......okay-ish
Big pluspoint is the absolute beauty of the screen and amoled display along with the undying battery...... literally puts up a good fight against low battery and have to struggle to keep it running less than 24 hrs from 80 percent
Heavy gaming.......check
Heavy browsing.........check
Heavy abuse.........check
No portable charger.......check
Adventure with just 20 percent.......check
Fast fingerprint.....check
Fast face unlock ........check
Tbh the only phone in this price range with ir face unlock
Go for it........
Cons....
Heating slightly during fast charging only
Heavy heating during processor intensive gaming like COD PUBG (at full specs)
Camera gives an uncomfortable click while using gcam.....its the lenses focusing
Plastic back and buttons
Glass camera lens
No camera bump
Gorilla glass scratches at 6 with deeper grooves at 7(mohs hardness)
300 mb of bloatware......nothing rooting cant fix.....
samsung max is quite useful free vpn service
Samsung widget is troublesome

Recommended.......
Metal rubberised frame
Gorilla glass tempered glass
Accessories like lenses etc depends on you....

Iam not a big fan of Samsung but here are some feature which I like about my new phone Galaxy M30 :-
Galaxy M30  1st it has good  battery
backup which is essential for my daily usage,
Superb display like the colors gleaming out from pictures-movies-games.
 Ram and phone  memory capacity is good, mine is 6gb and 128 GB.
If we talk about games what comes in mind is PUBG , yes it can be played in this mobile, reflex may slow down some time .

Camera is good  , triple camera with depth shot  feature is good enough, night shot taken inside home are also good

  like  the screen shot  feature unique  one, the  "always on " is a very good feature don't need  to press  power button every time to seek time.
 The phone is slim compared  to  other  devices in this category,  feels like it will slip off from my hand.
 The phone speaker sound is low compared to my previous phone Asus zenfone max pro m1 .
I like the night mode feature, it provides a good reading comfort for my eyes.
And blue light filter for  night is also one of my likes in this phone .
Finger print sensor response is slow for display turn-on .
Double tap for display-on  is also a good  feature  but it would  be great if double tap to display-off feature is also added  , I had Lenovo P2 which doesn't require double tap for display off , in task bar along with flash light, screen rotate it has display off , which functions both display off and lock  just require one single tap.
And data cable provided for fast charging is short compared to data cable provided by other companies.
Hope Samsung will provide such feature  in next update.
 Lastly I would say  M30 is a very good  phone.

After using Samsung M30 for 15 days I could say it's an amazing mobile for this price point. I had gone with this model seeing 6GB RAM, 128GB storage and 5000mAH battery and it lived my expectations.

I went to my office in the morning at 8:30 A.M with 30% of battery and with some nominal calls not much usage checking watsapp now and then, I returned home with my mobile still have 19% to go with.

Pros:
So here are things why you should go with this mobile.
1. Decent space 128GB lets you download many apps without giving any "storage space running out" errors. Already installed many apps but still have lot of space.

2. Camera is lot more natural compared to other makers who make you look more fairer. But not to expect such fake charisma. You could enjoy a natural and decent camera. Don't forget to say hi to your camera it let's you take your photo automatically.

3.Battery to me hasn't disappointed instead it surprised me for a superb extra life. Remember an extra save when we play temple run. 5000mAH is really a beast and all those battery lovers can go for this mobile.

4. You want to hide some personal pictures of yours. Don't worry you can delete them and find them safe in recycle bin. Yeah no need of 3rd party folder lock apps or Samsung Knox. All you need to do is simply delete from your gallery and intruders who browse your gallery won't find your personals but it's still there in your recycle bin. If you have mistakenly deleted your gallery items don't worry you have recycle bin to your rescue. If you want to permanently delete then you need to delete in Recycle bin.

5. Glitch free, fast and smooth performance for any popular games like subway surfers, Temple fun and candy crush. Havent tried PUBG, but might run well too. 6GB Ram and processor let's you have a smooth and skating performance.

6. Android pie out of the box and what else you need. Lock screen stories feature is really awesome, every time you press the unlock button you will find a new lock screen story with HD resolution pictures which let's your mobile look pro in front of your co workers or co passengers.

7. Descent fingerprint reader, unlocks nicely with just your finger tap else lock screen code will also do the magic.

8. Look of the phone is also superb with a large screen and rounded edges.

Cons:
1. Samsung M30 phone bit heavy, not a bad reason for phone buyer to consider yet most of the phones these days are light weight.

2. Box is devoid of headset which is just a turn off for those Samsung ear phone lovers. You are spending way too much for these many features, why not add a small head set to the accessories list. Samsung should have had placed a headset. (Solution: If you have your old Samsung phones ear phones then it'll do the work, I'm using my old earphones of Samsung Note3 Neo)

3. The charger wire is so short. Is it a cost cutting feature Samsung thought of? Should have increased price a hundred bucks more and have placed a lengthy wire. How many smart phone users travel in cars these days? People like me travel in trains where we need to put the charger in the plugpin and phone in the bag hung on the hanger but wire is too short. (Solution charge your phone in home only and need not worry in trains, battery won't let you down)

Not to consider these flaws much, but to me I have got a decent, good looking and a beautiful performer for this price tag. Hope my honest review would help you decide whether to buy this phone or not.

Pros:
Good Camera - triple camera works great! Manual setting is decent. Selfie camera comes with bookeh effect
long working battery. Works for almost 2 days with decent to heavy usage
Charger - its indeed superfast!
fast finger scan - works 95 out of 100 times.
Not many pre-installed apps - also these available apps can be removed if not required
Beautiful gradient finish on back panel
Super amoled screen is superb for watching HD pictures and movies
Cons:
Received box in seal broken along with box in damaged condition (wet and corner torned condition). No communication from seller after issues brought to notice. Since i had exchanged my exisiting phone, I cudnt wait for a new one without any phone. Sold by: STPL Exclusive Online. BEWARE
Pics get pixelated if clicked indoor
Selfie camera doesnt carry any functionalities other than bookeh effect.
Charger wire is super small. For the brand and price charged, a regular 1.5 mtr charging cable is expected
Fragile poly body - Be extra careful while handling it
Thicker than other phones in the same range like Vivo, Oppo and MI
Glass back instead of plastic back cud have added a premium finish to the phone unlike Vivo, Oppo and MI

Do not buy. Worst camera quality I have seen in recent times.Images look completely fake. 10 years before samsung had better camera in this range phones. Screen is pathetic,looks all artificial colour enhancement.

All the ratings provided here are bogus and probably paid. I believed the ratings and purchased this crap.

My return to samsung was dissapointing, unfortunately  can't return phones, hence I  am forced to use it, after some time will exchange.

Amazon only provided replacement on the device and no return. The device was replaced a week later, and then I got the new device. It had little hickups but it worked better than the last one. Once, it shut down abruptly. So I called amazon in order to register this issue. They said they would return the phone if the technician verifies the issue. But then it started working fine. Now it's been around a month and the phone has went into a boot loop. It automatically switches on and switches off. I urge everyone not to waste their hard earned money on this phone. Most of the pieces are defective and amazon tends to push this out of the ball park so that we customers can't talk to them about any issue and now it's the Samsung customer care problem. Shame on amazon for selling such a product. And heads up again guys, please don't spend your hard earned money on this phone.

As seen in the video, the phone boot loops and then it switches on. It lags like hell being a very new phone. Then it automatically switches off and goes into boot loop again.

Overall this phone is good when you compare price with specification and brand name.

Pros:
1. Battery life is very good.
2. Display is awesome.
3. Design
4. Camera

Cons:
1. Performance is not that great.
2. Fingerprint sensor doesn't recognize sometimes

Summary:
If you are Samsung brand lover, and medium end phone user,  go for this without any second thoughts.

The M30 is really worth for the money..
We get super AMOLED display and 5000mAh battery at merely 15000 Rs ...
The Dolby atmos also work good with earphones plugged in...
The only slight drawback is its performance with respect to gaming....
The Exynos processor just works fyn with PUBG...at low fps
One more setback is that it works on android 8.1 oreo (Samsung will come with its pie update maybe by the end of the year)..
Compared with redmi note7 pro in terms of gaming performance and camera M30 loses the battle but in terms of battery and display M30 is the winner...
Conclusion- For gamers I would recommend redmi note 7 pro but for others M30 will make you fully satisfied...

I bought it 2 months back.

Camera : Best in class, front camera is outstanding and back camera have wide angle lenses for covering more and more space.

Battery : Usually I charge once in two days infact after using my phone for entire day for Mail, Call, watsapp and net. It is also quite impressive.

Face lock : It works very fast in a second phone gets unlock.

One thing which is missing is on screen figure sensor otherwise phone is outstanding in this range and of course samsung is a well-known brand itself to trust on it.

I bought this phone after using realme u1. The display is very good and the phone feels premium. I'm not much of a photographer so can't comment on camera. But the few picture I took seemed nice. Finger print sensor is painfully slow. It takes 3-4 seconds to unlock. On realme it used to be instantaneously. Overall the phone has a lower grade processor and the phone becomes too slow after a month of usage. I only use email, youtube, amazon and web browsing on phone. No gaming or any other heavy duty task.

Battery life is good with 5000 mAh and charging is a tad faster with 15W charger. Finally I sold the phone after 3 months of use.

Its the best budget phone if u want good display and long a battery life. The phone do have premium feel to it.
Camera is not good. It can be improved by software update.
The glastic is nice but it desires scratches.

The processor does feel a little slow in everyday tasks. For pubg players I wouldn't recommend this phone.

I am not happy about the front camera. It makes photos to soft and doll like.

Finger print sensor has to very clean to detect your finger.

Overall a good branded phone.

The Samsung Galaxy M30 is a unique phone alone by its body having a gradient finish to it. Considering the fact the phone has an infinity display it’s super light weight and also very sleek. The ultra wide angle camera captures the entire picture in detail, and it’s supported by its auto focus. It also supports 4K video recording. The 16 MP front camera makes it ideal for taking the best selfies. In addition to the 128 GB internal storage, it can be extended up to 512GB. The Octo Core processor along with the 6GB of RAM makes the phone a ideal phone for heavy applications that work with extremely smoothly. The Processor and RAM also makes it’s a really good phone for Gaming especially for games like PUBG and Asphalt 9. The best about this phone is the fact that it only cost ₹17,990 which is a complete value for money.

I got my hands on this handset a month back. I am not a fan of Samsung phones but thought to invest in it for the first time. The battery, camera(in daylights), Front camera, seems to be working fine and it's good for this price range. What I don't like is the touch sensibility, the sound delivery. The touch sensibility is not that great sometimes and the sound quality is very low especially when you are watching YouTube, Netflix etc. The voice reception during calls is good. There is no slow motion option in the camera section which is a little disappointing. I am not a big fan of games so did not bother much on that.  Overall a average phone in this price range.

Product wise this looks fine, but what i want to write is, I bought this on 1st sep at a price of 13999, after 18 days you laubced 30s which offered more specs at the price range. So with a gap of 18 days my phone gets out dated and within a month u guys are going to give the m30 for 11999 l. This is not fair people who bought this phone. Either u provide atleast 30 days return policy or stop the phones atleast 20 days prior to a new release with more spec and same price

Worst customer service who is not ready for a replacement or refund. They told me to do factory reset thrice and I did. Later they told to install some app to monitor phone performance.. I did.. now they are saying they will send technician to check and I have to sit with him for hours to diagnose the issue.. if I had to spend so much time I would have bought a phone through store. Why would I prefer online??

Moreover technician isn’t available when I’m available ..
I need my 14000 refund ..!!

I bought this  phone a month back primarily for the use of watching videos, clicking pics and reading e-books. I have been a iPhone6s user for over 3 years now and I should say I was a little skeptical when I picked this phone but it has been such a lovely experience... We recently went on a trip to Maldives and did not have a DSLR to carry with us. This phone came to our rescue all through... the amazing picture clarity(check the pics)... the additional pro features of the camera... the ever lasting battery  helped us click some amazing pics.... and bring back our memories.... we almost clicked 600+ pics during our stay and still the battery did not dry out...

Pros:
- One of the best cameras in this segment
- Great battery life (minimum 1 and half day even with excessive usage)
- Fullcharge in less than 2 hours
- Amazing  screen quality does not hurt your eye even with heavy usage
- Very affordable price...

Cons:
-  Did not notice anything specific but feel it could have been the best deal if they provided a headset along with the phone.

Bought Samsung m30 (4G+64G) in September month end sale in just 9800/-.

The phone is bigger in size and heavy due to high capacity battery 5000mAH but battery backup is good.

Camera is worst quality, which has been a problem with samsung phones always.

Overall if you love taking pictures/selfies than it's not going to be a good phone for you.

This is a great phone , loved the quality , it's fingerprint reader works flawlessly , I've upgraded the latest Android version after the purchase and it was done easily , now the phone has latest android version.

Camera Quality on the phone is too good , loved taking pictures with it , not sure how bokeh mode can be done , but general pictures are of good quality.

Battery Life is ok - much better than my previous phones , it lasts a day with Data on.

Bit disappointed the Samsung released a new model with in months of my purchanse :(.

Good Product from Samsung. I do not know why people are saying that It heats up when  using or charging, no problem as yet tho..Camera is good, Sound is good, all in all it is a good cell phone. One thing more is  I would  recommend buyers  to first update their cell phone first of all before using.installing apps, then uninstall unwanted apps properly, refresh the cell phone by restarting it not switching it to flight mode, use device care/antivirus ( if any ) and then  use it on full battery charge.

Not at all happy with Samsung M30. I purchased this phone almost a month back. Within one month of usage, various performance issues surfaced. At times, adaptive brightness doesn't work.  You need to reset the adaptive brightness setting for it to work again. Sometime fast charging doesn't work.  I have noticed significant lag issue as well.  Camera and display quality are the only plus points I can think of. Rests are not worth writing home about. You have better phones available from other brands in this range. So stay away from Samsung M30.

I bought this phone after seeing lots of review and comparison between M30 &amp; Mi7 Pro.
I saw M30 surpass Mi7 pro by very little margin in Display, Battery &amp; superfast charger.
If you are not gamer than go ahead with  M30.
Pros:
Display
Battery
Fast charger in pack
Camera (both rear &amp; front)

Cons:
Volume (ringing / music) is not that great
Face recognition is working even if we show the locked phone while the person sleeping.
Background app management is slow. So don't open too many apps in background.
Conclusion:
Good phone for normal usage under 15k budget.

Using  this phone since last 30 days and this one is very good product  from Samsung  in this price range
Pros:
5000mAh battery  is enough  for fullday use.
Being  a super  amoled  display  is awesome.
Camera quality is also nice.
Face unlock  and fingerprint  is working nice.
Fast charging is and added advantage.

Cons:
If a person  is deadly  game lover this product is not fit for him

RAM is filling  too quickly

Lastest android version  not provided
No protrctive case or glass is present in box.

Samsung's trademark problem called 'hang' is also present but it is less than other Samsung  phones

This is my most awaited product I have purchased this phone after 1.5 months, due to unavailability on daily sale..but I am happy that something received after long wait is feeling awesome...this is a best phone in all the models whether it's for price or specifications. if you see the same configuration with other models it's highly expensive I have compared 25 models with M30, but there is something less features compare to this phone it's a cheapest phone in  the planet with high configuration (128gb 6gb Ram) try try again until you get the phone in the daily sale....thank you Samsung and Amazon for delivering on time.

Pros
Amazing display at this price point, 2 day battery backup on moderate to heavy usage,  super light for 5000mah battery phone.

Cons
Average cameras,  poor low light performance,  graphic intensive games dont play smooth,  very slow finger print sensor- takes 2 seconds to detect, akward placement of the sensor placed higher than regular phones.
The most annoying thing however is the spammy ads that pop up everytime.  I tried scanning through various malware/adware detectors but couldn't spot any rogue app.

Bettet Go for redmi note 7 pro  or realme 3 pro unless you are die hard fan of super amoled screen.

"This phone is very much attractive as well as good looking.
The camera results is very good.
Focus mood and blur is very much clear.
The system theme is awesome.
This phone also having a latest processor so working of phone is very fast and smooth.
Notch is very much attractive.
This phone is awesome as well as phone battery is amazing.
Battery backup is very long which is very useful.
The notification style on display is also beautiful.
The sound system of this phone is awesome.
Phone is very much attractive due to less thickness.
Phone is lighter so it can be easily maintain.
Camera is a best part of phone because the different type of picture can click in single phone like blur picture, wide range picture, different filter, etc."

Galaxy M30 is a great phone For the great budget, you get an AMOLED screen, better selfies, better connectivity (dual-band Wi-Fi), and a better portrait mode for the rear camera.You can record videos of beautiful moments, sceneries and watch them later.
Triple camera is useful in enhancing certain effects like blur, zoom and wide angle photos.
More cores result in better parallelism, meaning more tasks can be processed in parallel without slowing down the User Interface thats because of the insane ram. Time to beat everyone while playing PUBG ;)
It has a Gyroscope that determines orientation and rotation and provides more accurate 3D motion tracking than an accelerometer. All in all a power pack phone within the budget, I'd definetly recommend this phone.

The battery life is extremely good and generally lasts for two days while using the phone when talking 4-5 hours and continuous streaming of apps including streaming songs for 2-3 hours daily on the Samsung galaxy app.
The phone is very well designed and is ergonomically  good to hold and handle. Camera is rather nice providing high clarity and wide mode photos. The night mode photo with minimal ambient lighting is also good (photo placed above has been taken using M 30 mobile phone) All in all the mobile phone gives a really rich feel and at such a price it is definitely a good buy.

It is a decent phone - especially  considering the price category it falls in.

Display is excellent  - one of the best I've come across.

In my opinion, the battery life is not as great as the marker has made it out to be. It is not bad, either. Phone can last for a day if the usage is average to above average.

Camera is very strange - it clicks nice pictures and has a lot of options. But, the pictures are not high definition  and lose out on clarity (something that can be easily seen if you zoom in on any clicked picture : appear extremely pixelated).

Speakers are decent.

Facial recognition is not good. It is too slow in well-lit areas and doesn't work at all in areas with low-light even if I put the backlight function on.

Fingerprint reader is decent. Works most of the time. Suffers from the prevalent problem in almost all readers - doesn't work if fingers are even a little bit sweaty/dirty.

Been using it for a week now and i admit its a good phone for daily usage...
1. The best thing about the Galaxy M30 is its battery.. On moderate use, i.e. internet browsing, playing music, watching videos, talktime etc. a fully charged phone lasts 2-3days..
2. The single speaker at the bottom was better than expected with a hint of bass.
3. Screen is vibrant and good display of colors.
4. Major let down was the camera. Was expecting a lot for its triple camera functionality but the picture quality was below average specially at auto mode..
Not for the enthusiastic but overall a good piece for the day-to-day usage..

Max to max 3 out of 5. I dislike Samsung but unluckily hTC and Huawei are facing headwinds and I was forced to buy this as I did not want to spend excessively on a phone. Apple, any type is bloody problematic and full of tantrums and has always been blue blondish in nature. Samsung as generally is, honeymoon's over within the first 1-2 months. Now battery drains out easily. Hangs though I have only a few banking and app cab apps along with redbud and irctc. Various types of tantrums have now become chalu though it's only about 4/5 months that I have been using it. Overall as expected from Samsung for a phone in this price range, "Restart" and "God's grace" should be your most important and favourite words during the tenure of such a phone's usage with continuos chanting of these as the phone gets older

More than about fingerprint reader, camera quality and battery life I would like to share my feedback on phone display. The display of the phone got issue on the day one of purchase itself, when I checked with my friends who bought M series everyone has the same issue almost. Many of them have returned to and me too. Now I went with A50 it's pretty good and don't have any issues. I really love the M series of Samsung with the features they provide with cost but they need to focus on quality to stand in the market.

If you are thinking about a good budget device then, Go For It.
I've used this device for 7 months, in order to know about it current opinion, scroll down.
Pros:-
1. 5000 MAh Battery capacity!!
2. Triple rear Camera.
3. 16 MP front camera.
4. Full Screen (Notch) Display.
5. Super Amoled Display (gives the best colours possible)
6. Affordable!

Cons:-
1. It has Exynos processor for some reasons so you won't get to play very high graphics games very smoothly like you used to with sanpdragon...
2. Dosenot have a Metal Body which would have made it more scratch resistant...
3. I've heard that its face lock feature isn't that good but I haven't faces any issues with it so far...

Edit 1: After using it for a month, mobile suddenly was unable to charge, had to replace the charging port. And you will get a lot of scratches so, a cover is highly recommended!

Edit 2: Was Working Good for first 6 months but now, there are quiet a lot of issues like
1. Can't use Internet through WiFi.
2. Unresponsive incoming call interface.
3. Fingerprint sensor barely works.
4. Heating problem while charging.
5. Weak processor, hence device struggles a lot getting some tasks done.
6. Service Center cannot help me with any of these issues... 😐

So, here's my final conclusion. If you are laughing to use it for only 5-6 months, it's a biut deal. This device is not for a long run.

The Galaxy M30 Has An Amazing Oled display absolutely  loved it! Once seeing an oled screen you would never go back to a led or LCD screen the perfect pitch black and all. The Camera is also good it's a triple camera setup and the ultra-wide is nice which allows you to capture more of the moment and it has all the stickers and the Samsung exclusive  edits to the live photos. The fingerprint  sensor is quite good its fast but fails when finger is wet. The battery is good it lasts me a whole day so basically 1 charge for the whole day, and recently on June 1st it got the Pie update which made it damn  nice becuz of the dark ui and all. Overall it's a good phone and would definitely  recommend  it.

My phone is on a warranty that means it has not been even a year that I had purchased this phone and this my second Samsung phone with an OLED screen. Now they both have faced the same issue of OLED screen burn. Adding to the above issue my phones don't even have a single scratch on the screen and body. In that case, you can imagine how careful I use my devices.

Now due to the current pandemic, most of us are working from home. Because of this I cannot visit the Samsung store and get the screens replaced. And now I am stuck with the phones without screen and no MFA's or email apps or chat apps for my work.

@Samsung: At least use components that will work properly until you claim of warranty.

Great buy at the price in sale. Not happy with camera. Especially indoor shots. You can get much better cameras in this range. Bit the phone is snappy and fast even with 3GB RAM. OS is good and screen is awesome. Make sure to get amazon solimo case with it. And use with tempered glass.

Edit at 2 months - the supposedly 5000MAh battery doesn’t actually seem to be that big. Not more than 4000MAh I guess. Battery life doesn’t do justice to the capacity claimed.

Pros
Battery lasts 2 days for now.Dont know about after a few months.
There is a white glow around the selfie cam when u face unlock it which looks nice.
Fingerprint sensor can be used to swipe up and down the notification menu.
Dual 4g Volte standby.
Dark theme available.
Lot of samsung care apps.
Speaker sound is extraordinary.Very loud for now dont know after few months.
Cons
Fingerprint sensor fail to work most of the time.It says to clean it every time.
Samsung camera is bad.Has very few features compared to Asus camera.Just a camera to click pics thats all no special effects nothing.
Size of icons cannot be reduced.Stays very big which is boring.
Audio jack is at bottom which is very hard to use while listening music.

A better varient of samsung with a new look. After using many devices of samsung for a several years this phone introduces with a great quality with a fast processor experience. The fingerprint reader works superb without a fail. The camera quality is very very nice with its tripple rear lenses and also its front facing camera. The battery is superbbbbbbb. The biggest quality of the phone is its battery backup with a quick adaptive fast charging quality which makes the battery full charged with a less time. The one of the most essential quality is its huge 6.4 inch giant SUPER AMOLED display which makes the phone better and the best other than any devices.

I like the fingerprint scanner. Resonding very quickly. Every thing looks good. But only one thing I could not understand. For some reason I could not get whatsapp notification alerts. The whatsapp application icon not showing any unread messages. All other apps are showing the unread messages count. I have checked so many times in settings. Everything looks good but not showing the whatsapp unread messages count. Other than that no issue about this phone.

This phones has lots of positive points especially looking at its price point. Screen is awesome hardly any phones with OLED in this segment. Battery lasts for 3 full days with moderate to heavy use. Looks are premium and much better than the pictures. Has latest ac wifi receiver. UI is very light unlike previous Samsung versions. No lag or hangs while using. Cell reception is better compared to other phones in same room. Camera quality decent with unique wide angle mode. Size is larger and one handed use is not that easy but thats happening with all phones nowdays. Not sure why people spend 3 to 4 times M30's cost to buy a 'premium' phone which looks the same and does nothing more than what the M30 does.

Yet another crap from Samsung. Much lagging, very slow and very poor 4G signal reception. Thought of buying a phone from Samsung after a long gap hoping that Samsung would have improved significantly, but HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED. the same old poor performance stuff. Now blindly closing the doors towards Samsung for ever.
One more thing, don't ever mind this replacement/refund of Amazon, they will make us fools after days of hanging around behind this replacement play/drama. Finally, they would tell that the product is excellent and we were crazy to go behind all these procedures. Feels flipkart return policy and procedures are MUCH MUCH SUPERIOR than here. Have excellent experience even in refund of unworthy product. that means, purchasing trust and courage increases with that kind experience since we have a chance to repurchase if the product if its not up to the expected level. Anyway Amazon lacks that, and unfortunately i am a prime member of Amazon :-(

First time I bought this phone I had no issues. Built was normal quite heavy though. Screen size is good.
But problem started after 3 months. Mobile used to work improperly. I went to samsung service center, they restored previous version and made the phone work properly. But again after 1-1.5 months my phone’s screen stopped working. Again I had to go samsung service center. They did the same thing, getting my phone restored to previous version.
I am very unsatisfied with this phone. I would suggest to try phone from another company which are available at this price but with better durability.

Great Battery,Camera and display.
Goes from 15 to 100 in 2hrs 15mins with the in the box charger.
Asphalt 8 can be played lag free in high graphics.
Bloatware or unnesessary apps can be stopped from getting installed.
The Ultra wide camera is great and both the rear setup and front camera provide sharp and good quality pictures.
The phone does not lag at all in handling day to day tasks and can also handle multitasking with ease.
My review is based on my 2 weeks usage.
If you want a phone for taking pictures,watching videos and playing non-heavy duty games,this phone is for you.
This combines the specs of Xioami and the Quality and assurance of Samsung.

Fair quality overall. Not that sturdy as Mi phones. Had protective armour still an accidental fall broke it's display in less than a month of it's purchase. Display is excellent, body and display could have been made better for Indian conditions by Samsung for it's price mark. There is cost cutting for the sure. So can't be regarded as 100% value for money. MiA2 and MiA3 have great build quality than this phone. Verdict: Phone is good but fragile.

I have been using this phone for a month now and here is my review. Samsung's M series smartphones are really good budget phones and it is one of the most trusted brands. There is no compromise in quality. The phone and display look very stylish, especially blue variant.
Note: 1st pic normal camera, 2nd pic wide angle, 3rd pic live focus (portrait mode)

Pros:
1. Display: comes with amoled fhd display. Everything looks so clear and colorful yet natural without much strain on eyes.

2. Battery: 5000 mah is huge for normal usage and good for heavy users. It will easily last a day even after heavy use. Comes with a 15w charger. Takes approximately 1-1.5 hours to charge the phone completely.

3. Camera: if you are familiar with Samsung phones you know about their camera. Though not as good as signature S series, you can find difference if you compare with similar phones. Wide angle is really good. Front camera is really good even in dim light.

4. Comes with Dolby atmos. You get a good movie feel when you plug in headphones and turn on dolby atmos. Also sound is good while gaming.

Cons:
1. Processor: comes with a Exynos 7904, a Samsung made processor. It easily handles multi tasking and gaming but you can see the fps drops in big games like pubg when a lot of action is happening. M40 comes with snapdragon 675, way more powerful in terms of processing.

2. Face unlock is good but it sometimes won't recognize in room light. You need to face the light and adjust the angle to unlock. In daylight, however, it is really fast and good.

Brought the phone for the promised camera quality. - The quality of wide angle photos are very poor. Poor low light photography. The photo quality is nothing like what they have shown in the sample.
-Battery backup is very good.
-Decent performance by the processor.
-Display quality is Great.
- Charing is not that fast. 1 hr 45min is not fast enough.

I have used Samsung 6 years before and really had bad experience i.e hanging, call quality, frequent network issues. I thought to try one more time to buy M30 and again bad experience. This phone is everything except a phone. You can take good selfie, can watch movies with superb quality, but you can not make calls, most of time voice break and you can not hear the voice of other side, suddenly it start to show 'not registered on network error' and will not go away until you restart it. Still not worth buying Samsung at all

This phone is definitely worth buying if you're looking for long battery life along with an excellent AMOLED display under ₹15,000.

The battery is quite long and charges quite fast with the fast charger that it comes with and the display is awesome. The notch is barely even noticeable!

The front camera isn't amazing, but it's definitely adequate and the ultra wide is pretty good too but the quality isn't the best but still adequate.

The fingerprint scanner isn't fast but definitely not slow at all, it takes one second and the feature to open notification center using the scanner is quite useful too.

The processor could have been better but it also could have been worse. Th Exynos 7904 is good for multitasking and light gaming but it struggles with heavy gaming (For example, PUBG MOBILE on high settings).

Overall, I'm quite happy with the Galaxy M30.

I was happy with this phone till Android 10 Update. There was a indication on the phone about the new update, so I updated
After update, I find it really, really laggy. So I googled online and tried many tips and tricks. But of no use. So I reset the phone to the factory settings. Later it worked for a 3 to 4 days smoothly. And after that, again the phone became very laggy.
So I took it to the Samsung Customer Care Center.
The Samsung Customer Care Center executive told me that they will do a factory reset of the phone in order to get the phone work properly. I told them that, I have already done it.
But they told me that, customers should not update their phones by themselves.
They have to carry the phone to the nearest Samsung Customer Care Center and get the update done by them.
(It's something that i have never heard off.)
They hooked my mobile phone to their computer and they did the factory reset. Again after 3 to 4 days same story again.
So I called the call center for help. They told me that they are aware of this issue and their team is working to fix this. (Generic answer from a Call Center)
Now I am regretting buying this phone. So I am opting to exchange this phone for a well known Chinese Brand in India.
Conclusion: Buying Samsung M30 is a waste of money..

I bought this mobile 25days back
I am going to mention only cons about this mobile. It heats up fast at hearing port while talikng. Has bit bad touch sensor. Couple of days back I had connected my mobile to bluetooth headset for the whole day and at eveng while i was on call it all of sudden started restarting continuously. It almost kept restarting for 15mins  and for PUBG fans its 100% BIG FAT NO. Game doesn't run on this mobile . So i would say better not to go for this mobile.

It  did not  meet the expectations  written  on the  phone  qualities of reviews.
 Waste of  our money.
 Poor camera.. gets all pics glared.. waste of it.
 Poor battery  life..
 Even though  written as flash  charger ..  it takes 6 hours for  chaging..

So many  issues

 Total  waste of money..

 Samsung lost its  potential.

 It is  better  to buy a new  phone  of one plus. Or I phone  which  can last for  3 to 5 years.. than samsung  which  lasts less than a year..

  Quality  always  matters  which is  missed

I paid 7600 for this phone. I bought it for my father. And I can say its awesome for parents or anyone who doesn't need huge CPU power.

Display is awesome due to super amoled.
Battery will last 1.5 days easily with moderate usage.
Camera is also value for money

And remember its came with Android 10 pre-installed with OneUI 2.0

Camera quality can have been better.
Battery life ok till now.
Fingerprint reader absolutely sensitive and fine.
Liked the 'Hide App' feature.

Dislikes-
- Message does not have 'pin to top' option. So it becomes difficult to find important messagses in my message list.
- Keyboard doesnot have 'Clipboard' option. It is boring to type common words/phrases again and again.
- Nothing important/useful new feature found.

I brought my samsung M30 for under 10K. Here is my review after using it for 5 months now.
I could install only 6 additional apps to it in 5 months till now at any given point of time. Thanks to slowest processor ever used. The pre-installed apps eat up a lot of memory.
Slowest camera ever used. Takes 2 attempts to open the camera ALWAYS. But I would rate Camera quality as good.
Battery performance : good
wifi calling : for name sake
call network quality not good.
Not very robust as compared to Xiaomi phones.
Totally not a good phone to buy as it's an extremely slow phone( not even considering price).

I have been using this phone for 1 month.
Let's directly jump to pros and cons.

&gt;&gt;Pros:

•Superb Display quality. sAMOLED
Punchy colors.
There is not much strain felt in eyes even after several hours of use even in dark.

•Cameras is just awesome and performs more than expected in low light and artificial lighting conditions. Wide angle camera is of much use for group photos or scenery.

•Since ONE UI update replaced Samsung experience UI , RAM management has improved to an unexpected level.

•AODs (Always on Display) this is a really useful feature (personally) and also it looks cool.😜

•Battery life of the phone is just awesome.
One and half day with heavy usage.
Two days with normal usage. (Keeping AOD on)

•Charging Speed is also awesome and you get fast charger in box itself.😜

•Triple slot ( 2 Sim card + 1 memory card )

&gt;&gt;Cons:

•Phone gets a bit heaten up while playing heavy games like PUBG although game runs smoothly.

•Speakers needs to be more loud but sound clarity is very good.

THere was so much hype about Samsung Mseries- that I purchased this M30 4GB RAM,64GB Storage
on 21 Jan and exactly 1 month in Feb i started facing problems of slowness, hanging, and all of sudden the display freezed. Just in 1month of purchase, these Amazon ppl are selling defective pieces and give a window of 10 days where obviously the product issues doesnot show up
This is cheating innocent customers

M30 is good but not a great choice given that Mi has something better to offer in this price. Again, while I was placing the order Samsung offer on M series was on till 24th July on HDFC Credit Cards. I wonder how it disappeared while making my payments. Hence I request Amazon/Samsung to give me my missed offer as my order lies well within offer period. The offer was of instant discount, Make My Trip, Oyo etc. Expecting a reply soon from all the concerned parties with this particular order. Thanks.

I love the premium screen quality and the battery life of this phone. I have been a loyal Samsung user and this is with no doubt a good worthy mid ranger. Built wise I am a little off about the plastic make butg it does not feel that poor in look. The glossy back is however not fingerprint resistant so you will definitely need a good back case (good for phone case lovers). Thge fingerprint sensor is okayish, there is a little delay in response sometimes. As far as the operating system is concerned it is fine but again 'sometimes' there is heavy hanging. No heating issues so far and I really appreciate that about Samsung and also believe their low radiation emission is indeed true, shows concern for customers health. Gaming is average anyway I could satisfactorily play(not a heavy gamer though). Camera quality is just above average in low light settings but awesome in good and natural light setting. Speakers are fine too. So I guess I have covered all the basic stuff about the phone. Overall I love it and touchwood about the battery life... I am expecting a long battery life😅🤞🤞🤞

Phone is too good and being Samsung M series it has to be impressive.Ram being 4GB is good enough for a person like me and 64 gb storage is more than needed for me.front and back camera both are proper and pictures I clicked, are really nice. Charging is not getting drained like before used phones so impressed with it and gets charged quickly within some time. 1.8 GHz processor is appreciated. Supports 4g which is the best part. Android system 8.1 i.e Oreo version is already available.At once 2 sim cards can be used so happy for it. Since I'm using Samsung it's always a happy moment for me. It's light weighted
so it's always a plus point. Display is really very good and very sensitive. I'd give a 5/5 for Samsung M30

Delivery of product was on time. I have Samsung worst experience in past,  previously I took 2 mobile phones both phone use to have frequent repair. After that I switched to MI and I am very very very happy with MI mobile phone. By Girlfriend don't like MI so I gifted her with Samsung galaxy m30. With in a week I it's charger stopped working. I went to service centre there also Samsung service guys doesn't assist well. For change of cable they made me to sit for 2.30 hrs. Now after changing cable after 30days now again I am unable to charge my phone and I can see the phone backside is burn i.e. the back side of the phone is changed its colour. Now my phone is switch off and I am unable to charge it. Guys Samsung is worst phone I have ever seen.

The mobile was great, it felt nice in your hand, build quality was good enough, camera and processor were as expected, batter lofe is crazy good. But, the product I bought had a bump on its back panel and Amazon did not support with the replace, I had to call the support 11 times and every time there was a new person who would as to mail the images and then he would verify and promise to initiate the replacement, which was a lie. Finally when we started abusing the support manager, he did initiate the return instead of replacement and then threatened me that the delivery person will com at any time and won't wait a minute longer and if we missed the opportunity to return we will have to keep the phone. So a really bad experience with amazon.

M30 is not the best choice for game lovers...
This has good s-amoled display and battery backup will b good if you restrict background running apps by using third party apps like greenify.

There is no notification led blink light
Phone lags if you play games like pubg
You will not find network connectivity strength since I compared with jio at my home.. other phone has a signal of 80% but this M30 gave me signal of 50% ...
Over all if you like watching HD 4k movies good for them..  game lovers better go for honor play

the phone hangs when u turn it on first time. I cant believe Samsung has provided  such unstable phone.  Even software update is not getting done. Phone restarts automatically &amp; update installation is done till 28%. I am not able to turn off the phone even with the help of internet. Waiting for amazontechnician to come &amp; check the phone. Totally disappointed. This shows samsung has launched this phone in hurry &amp; quality check is also not done before launching it in the market.

Most probably, its not as fast as MI Note 7 Pro, but it works very well.
I mainly use it for taking photographs when I do not carry DSLR or when I want to take landscape. It works well.
Battery backup is awesome.
I have found some Apps getting hanged or slow down, but then, I dont use them much. The ones I use, like Avia Video Player, YuuTube, IG, Twitter/facebook, they work very well and never crashed so far!
I use jio SIM and use this phone as hotspot for my laptop. Last two days.
Overall, I am very happy with this phone.
Many said, it is a beautiful phone.

Amazon delivered the mobile on time but it was hanging again and again. It was unresponsive when hanged, nothing happen, no switch off, no response from device. Finally I order for replacement, thanks to amazon for this great feature.
Got second device within 2-3 days and it works great, no hangs. I think first was defective item delivered to me.
Finally thanks to amazon

I'm surprised that,  Samsung a superior branded phone itself is not good at basic features.  Rating 1 because no negative star exists. Finger print doesn't get recognized easily and camera gets hanged when I turn to either selfie or photos from video or video from photos. Phone gets heated too much while charging. Doesn't display the name or number when somebody calls on this phone.
Don't know what to do at this stage.  I have been using Lenovo phone for the last 3 years almost and it was fantastic this way for atleast 3 years. I highly recommend not to buy this product. Every day it is getting worse and looks like I've to buy another phone as it doesn't switch on when I press unlock button or using finger print too.

Review after 2months usage:
Camera crash after recent update is irritating with no solution. If triple camera phone doesnt take photos , probably most useless bug.

Battery dies in 8-9hr normal usage continous data + wifi

Fingerprint is not smooth just above normal

Samsung m30 is great, very premium looking and m series stands out from the previous models they have been coming up with like the j series, battery life is great, you can use it for two days straight on full charge I.e if you're not gaming intensively.. the processor is not that strong honestly, when you use too much of apps in the background you do notice a lag, the camera is awesome to play around with like the wide angle though the quality seem abit fuzzy as long as you're not doing professional print it's fine posting it on social media. The display is the most stunning feature for me SUPER AMOLED display with 5000mah battery.. seriously who will give you that in this price range.. over all it's a great phone.. I'm  glad I bought this phone.

It went offf with three months of usage now its not working. Worst phone. How to service. I took the phone  to  service centre and they told me mother board issue and got repaired it in warranty and they agreed every m series phone is designed in same way so it gets failed repeatedly without any problem from end user it goes off automatically and so plz take the extended warranty worth 1200rs and i took it. Again in a month again the phone went off the same way with flashy image and cracks on internal side of display and this time they took 4230 rs for repair claiming it internal cracks due to physical damage ( this time also i.ve done nothing like it hasn't fallen down from my hands and even no external force applied by me on phone..) still i paid a lot of money till now. Again in the month of october exactly 6 months after my phone purchase the same issue internal cracks of display and phone went off again they are asking me to pay 4230rs  as it wont cover this issue in warranty. When i asked for how many times should i pay to service agent of authorised service center they claim that we are no where concerned about this problem if you need phone you should pay otherwise buy a new phone. After so much of discussion they agreed this is a failed version so we are providing m30s series free screen replacement twice option this issue is happened because of manufacturing failure but we can't provide free service. If you need phone pay 4230 rs or go for consumer forum we are not concerned about it becauae every m series phones are designed in the same way and we won't agree its our manufacturing problem because we don't want to pay customer back. They even agreed these m series phones are all failed pieces of galaxy s8, s9 and s10. We are just recycling them and selling for low cost so that user might use such high end phone for low amount and quality doesn't matter in such amount so people can't do anything. So consumers plz don't buy this m series and get trapped like me. This samsung is cheaters. Tc

Please Dont Buy MI Phones, they are creating fake demands and now the product quality is too worst , all phones are hanging , no battery back up ,cant attend phone call properly, battery life too short , all application we have to depend third party , always hanging

Nobody  buy this product , worst worst phone

old phones like MI Note 4 and all having automatic call recording option and dual app option, Mi remote  this new advanced phone doesnt have, battery life is also not satisfied and camera quality also not much better

It seems a good product if you go by its features on card but when you use it you will feel as cheated dejected as i am feeling after using this for a month .The phone battery having 5000Mah as stated last for only 4 hrs of continuous use that too is normal use ..no haeavy games no online video streaming.it just lasts in only 4 hrs.overheating is also a big issue....you can back chapati on it after using few minutes.
If i look for the pros in this phone then its the screen and camera except these two pros nothing worth the money .hanging is also abig issue ..touch is okk ok not so quick and responsive.my advice for the potential buyers to avoid this phone and go for similar priced similar or advance specification phones from realmi, xiomi or other companies.
Seriously avoid this phone.

Amazon started Samsung Galaxy M30s sale from 28th Sep but they didn’t put it in the listing, I wanted to buy M30s but ended up ordering M30 considering it M30s, next day ordered when M30s was available, I ordered M30s also and called customer support to replace the phone but they refused to do that so I continued to keep M30 and cancelled M30s, I am happy that I kept a tested phone bcoz M30s was boasted a lot but didn’t come up to the mark as expected.
Using M30 for last one week, a great phone with great features

The Samsung M30 comes with a 6.40 inch touchscreen display and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. This power packed device with a 5000 mAH supports fast charging and is powered by a 1.6 GHz octa-core Samsung Exynos 7904 processor that features 2 cores clicked at 1.8GHz and 6 cores clocked at 1.6Ghz and 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage. This device runs on Android 8.1 Oreo and packs 3 rear cameras (13, 5 And 5 megapixel each) and a 16 megapixel front facing selfie camera for perfect selfie shots. In my personal opinion this phone is a win win when it comes to value of money and great features.

Samsung is back in the mid range market. The SAMOLED screen is such a nice introduction to this midrange phone. I purchased 4/64 variant and guess what, it has been flowing like anything. However primary purpose is calling and whatsapp, youtube. No gaming in it. Sound quality in speaker  is bit low compared to other phones. Video clarity is superb.. Overall, a wonderful package from Samsung

This phone is a super value pruduct at such a price and its features and specs makke it price worthy. The finger print reader is real time quick, camera quality is excellent with its wider angle view perfect, added to it this phone has a superb screen view experience with super amoled view, the battery lasts long and no worries of charging the phone...i get 4 days of battery life with a single charge with calling and moderate use of data. gaming is super cool with this phone..uptil now the phone has not heated either during charging nor during gaming or movie viewing..
it has a super battery saver with three modes and can make your phone work the entire day with a 10% battery charge..so all in all a real good deal at this price..watching movies in a 6.4 inch screen with full HD+ view alongwith total screen view is a wonder.....

Battery life is good, fingerprint sensor is working fine, but face recognition is not as good as it should be, camera is ok not as good as expected.

I have been using this mobile for quite some time now and to give a gist I have to say that there are a few compromises made to give consumers some decent specs.

Some good stuff,

Battery life is amazing.
It gives me 1.5 days of power and still there is some 15% mostly remaining. Only 30% is sufficient to drive your day with normal usage of emails, songs and 30 mins of YouTube.

Charges fast
Little more than half an hour is sufficient for 45% charge.

Camera
You can not underestimate m30 here, it can take some serious photographs, if you do the settings right.

Display
Only one word, Wow!

Safe
Other manufacturers in this range are mostly Chinese and everyone is aware that china is known for data theft. I might be wrong on this but anyways I don't trust these brands anymore.

3.5 mm Jack not at top.
This is a very specific issue, for me this is good because if you have wired earphones, wire handling becomes very easy.

Some bads,

Fingerprint scanner
It is the slowest I have ever used, although you will get used to it.

Body
I have never used this phone without a cover, ever though it has developed big scratches at it's back. They are noticable even from a distance, if I remove the cover.

Wide angle lens
It is there for just name sake, it doesn't take good photographs.

Overall if you have used your old phone for quite some time and are looking for a phone for next couple of years, I think this is an option worth considering.
Please note that I am not a heavy user!

After much research for my budget, this is truly the best phone I could buy. No complaints at all, everything is fantastic for it's price. Value for money, sleek design, sturdy and colour gradation is pretty too. The phone functions as one would expect for the specs (pretty great)
The interface is user friendly and although it's no Apple (price difference so of course), the themes and designs make it versatile and personalized. Truly an excellent product, fully worth your money. Very satisfied

First of all, I'm a loyal SAMSUNG Guy; I can't use OPPO/VIVO because of their User Interface. Prior to M30 I have used J7!!! Thats why I was very upset when I heard SAMSUNG wont give OneUI to M-Series, but it didn't happen; SAMSUNG shocked everyone by giving OneUI to its Millennium series...

1.sAMOLED Display under 15k: I Can't Use a Phone that doesn't have OLED Panel !!! I just hate TFT &amp; LCD panels !!!
2.Huge 5000mAH Battery: Phone lasts atleast 2 days with normal usage &amp; 1.5 day with heavy usage.
3.Supports HD streaming: I'm a Netflix User.
4.Dedicated card slot: I'm a guy who uses 2 SIM's with a SD Card in it.
5.USB Type-C port and fast charging that charges phone in just approximately 45 min to 1 hour.

So I ordered this mobile as a gift for my sister and below points are from her after using it for about 2.5 months now:
1. Earphone jack positioning at the top is inconvenient but atleast it has one unlike many other OEMs.
2. Being a power user, the battery lasts about 1 day which is great.
3. The display is bright which enables one to look at display under direct sunlight easily.
4. For an average user, the camera is good for pictures taken daily but certainly cannot be compared with flagship phones camera. But again, for the price at which the mobile is available I'd say it has a great camera for most.
5. The phone is buttery smooth until now.
6. The updates are not as frequent as other OEMs, still no word when android 10 will be rolled out.

Samsung Galaxy M30, a wonderful mobile and am happy to have it purchased through Amazon Prime sale. There is nothing to be disliked off, so to be very precise, the Battery life, Screen display, Camera and what not, all are superb for the price I paid. I didn't go for M40 and opted M30 series just because I dislike the Hybrid sim slot. Packing too was good. Really happy to have purchased this from Amazon.

1. The battery discharges very quickly, lasts only for 9-10 hours with a decent use. The claim of 5000mah battery power with long lasting life IS NOT true, not for this product i received. Battery life sucks.
2. On opening the apps from notifications received, the app crashes - need to locate the app and then go through
3.  Bad finger print sensor/reader, takes long to read and detect.
4. While typing on the keyboard, it automatically takes you to homepage!
5. Phone needs to be put on speaker or with headphones on, inbuilt fault with my phone. Cannot stick it to ear to speak
6. Phone gets disconnected suddenly on its own, happened various times.

Inconvenient.

Reached out to Samsung to highlight my concerns to seek out help, but no response from the team!
Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product to be bought. my old phone works better than the brand new M30

I am not a pro to write review just a normal end user. I purchased this during the launch after trying out twice was lucky to get it at 3rd attempt.
But I must say it was worth waiting for. I was planning to purchase oppo or vivo but somehow was not convinced to go for them and trusted Samsung from the time I started using my first phone.
Pros:
Battery backup top notch
Camera quality superb
Ram 8gb no lag experienced
It's a true multi tasker
Value for money really
Charger is superfast

Cons:
I didn't find a single one till now coz I really love using it

If you are looking for a budget phone with high end experience invest in this piece you will definitely not regret it. It has style and performance both. I love it really.

Thanks to new age manufacturing techniques, the phones looks like it has been 3d synthesized from an outer space printing unit. Although all current smartphones are getting manufactured in similar ways, Samsung M30 has got the best display, best camera, adequate memory(3GB variant) and strong processor combined with a massive battery in a lightweight and slim case.
Due to lack of grip I am using tpu back cover. Instead of using back cover, mobile back could have had rubber like grip coating as optional variant.

Well, Samsung m30 comes as a pleasant surprise from Samsung whose earlier budget smartphones were not that good. Battery life is where this phone beats every competition it has, it easily lasts 2 days on an average usage and on intensive usage it lasts 1.5 days. The fast charger is another advantage this phone has.
The AMOLED screen is just a cherry on top
Amazing screen clarity and that infinity U notch looks amazing.
The triple camera setup is simply amazing for all the camera freaks.
The phone ticks all the boxes since it has USB C-type but it doesn't miss out on a 3.5mm jack.
The one UI is one of the smoothest and efficient UIs from Samsung.
Dolby Atmos takes the headphone experience to another level.
AMOLED helps to save a lot of battery.
Cons
The plastic back doesn't feel as premium to hold onto and is a fingerprint magnet.
You might need to install some third party apps for additional features that come as standard in Xiaomi aur Huawei devices.
The speaker ks adequate but not as good as the competition.
There are no lags in gaming and multi tasking but this phone doesn't fare as good as redmi note 7 pro in gaming and editing.
The fingerprint reader is adequate and fast but the reader on Xiaomi devices is much faster

The Samsung Galaxy M30 has a gorgeous AMOLED screen and looks just awesome from the front. The front camera resides in a U-shaped notch, which is inconsequentially smaller than the V-shaped notch on the Galaxy M20 and M10.If you ask me, I quite like the software experience on the Galaxy M30, and it definitely gives M30 an edge over Xiaomi, Realme, and Vivo phones. And yes, unlike most phones in this segment, the Galaxy M30 can stream HD content from Netflix and Amazon Prime.Compared to the M20, the Galaxy M30 adds a third camera sensor to sweeten the pot. This extra unit is a depth sensor that makes the live focus mode so much better. I'm in love with this model.

The main camera produces images that look good on mobile phone, but just enlarging it to 3X shows that pictures lack sharpness.  Indoor pictures appear slightly okay, but those taken outdoor look bad. In fact, picture quality is shockingly bad in detail. The edges of objects appear blurred.  Don't buy this phone if you like to click outdoor pictures. Just zoom this photo that I took on my M30 recently and you can see blurs around all buildings etc.

Worst product and customer help.. this is my 4th phone.. and for the first time I am having Samsung phone... started hanging and reboot by itself within  1 week of delivery .. I complained at amazon app.. I wanted to replace.. they didn't replace.. they told me to  install smart check app, and said nothing is wrong, which was not so... after that I went 4 times to nearby service centre.. they updated software, changed parts.. no effect... I called samsung customer care. No help... I just want to return this product.. i hate this product..

One major and two minor problems(in order) in my opinion: 1) the touch screen is not good specially while picking up the phone. This is the one of the primary function of the phone and sometimes it takes 3 or 4 attempts to pick up the phone.
2) the camera and video somehow makes you whiter than you are actually(perhaps they know how color obsessed we are)
3) unnecessary samsung apps.

I have buy this product because of Brand reputation but did not come up to my expectation as compare to other samsung mobile  I am using as Samsung On Max and J2 Pro (2016). Not working in Weak Signal as compare to other phone, everytime disconnected and have to manually configuring it, usually I used maximum for Internet. Front Camera is good but Rear camera is inferior. FingerPrint reader, Face Recognition and Battery is excellent.  Overall built and function is good as Processing speed, Loudspeaker, HD screen and video quality.
I will give Three Star  and Price is little bit High it should be around Rs.12000.

Writing after using for 2 weeks.

■Display awesome.
Battery backup is great. 5000mAh + it's an ■amoled screen so you can turn individual pixels off by applying a black wallpaper and turning the night mode on.
■UI performance is great. No lags or hitches in the transition effects.
■Gaming performance is not bad but if you are into mobile gaming, go for SDM processors in this pricepoint.
■Memory and storage management good
■Camera is good in sunlight,  both wide and standard lenses perform well, depth sensing is quite good but not the best. But in artificial lighting conditions, the camera fails to capture details in the photo.
■Front camera does it's job pretty well.
■ Video recording is the thing that disappoints me. No slow motion mode, even not a time lapse mode. Which, I miss as I had it in my old Redmi Note 5(Which is completely fine after 1.5 years of use, I gave it to my Ma)
■ The OneUI itself is good. Like the Always On Display. Like the other features you might miss if you use a stock android phone. Also miss some good features from MIUI 10

Overall, a good daily driver. Samsung is back in the track in the budget market.

The one negative part I felt is the camera quality. Sometimes the quality of rear camera is lil low. also getting some grain particles while capturing. also the 3rd cam feels like fish eye lens while capturing the wide angle pics.

But the battery life so good. I got 2 days of batter backup

Also fingerprint reader is so good.

Defective Product Delivered. Sim tray is not coming out. Unable to insert the Sim Card.
I was very excited as I have gifted the phone to my Dad but Amazon spoiled my mood. Reported to Amazon about it as it is not getting returned from Amazon application. Now they will send a technician to after 36 hours and get a report prepared and submit to Amazon. Basis on that my replacement will be done. Which will again take time 4-5 days.
Sorry Amazon but this time really not happy with the Services

Completely disappointed with this product. It's not up to the expectation and is definitely not worth 16k. Trusted the Samsung brand and chose this over other brands, it turned out to be a disappointment.

The camera quality is not good, the screen resolution is not up to the mark and is not at all HD. The screen is so delicate that it broke on a slightest fall that too within a month of buying this product. Irony is the tampered glass is intact but the screen is shattered. To replace that it is costing me 6k, which is not covered under the warranty and u will have to Shell out from your own pocket. I know that's what Samsung's business model is, to make more money..

I'm not gonna buy another Samsung product again and will advice others as well the same. Go for any other brand guys. This product is not worth the money you guys will be spending.

Firstly, its a great phone... i mean the best in this price range. I had many options like redmi, vivo, oppo, but after a lot of research i decided to give Samsung a chance, and ooh boy I'm happy.

The display of the phone only makes it worth the price, and one ui is also very very good, I have used color os, and miui before and i can say the one ui wouldn't disappoint you.

The battery life is above satisfactory, and I'm a really heavy user, so you can do the math.

The fingerprint reader is sadly average and not as fast as you would expect it to be.

And lastly the camera software of this phone sucks...front camera is decent but the rest is really really bad, i can say my 2years old oppo had better camera than this one, but that was a bit fixed with gcam mod which you can download if camera really matters to you that much.

Finally the performance will not disappoint you, it'll handle multitasking effortlessly.
And can't say anything about gaming cause I'm not much of a gamer.

first of all thanks to amazon for initiating  my return  for this product, now samsung, worst  product i have ever seen
its  hangsas it has only 1 GB or less ram.
, don't know about others but as per my experience it has been customized in that way so that you should be able  to receive update only  through samsung app store.
only buy if you have plenty of  time and money to waist.
there are many other options are available in the same price.
my request to all  please stay away .

"Battery life"no doubt is appreciable,phn is available with all the required feature,compass tool is quite useful
Only thing that lags is "camera quality",it should me more inovative with extra and cool filters. As it has triple camera so this phone should have focus tool for potrait.
"Fingerprint reader" is moderate.

Review after 30 days of regular and consistent use.(12-14 hours per day)
Pros
1.sAmoled screen and battery life and earpiece sound.
2. Watching and streaming HD content is a nice experience.
3.UI is good and improved.
4. Ringtones are load and clear.
5. Speaking in crowd is hassle free without disturbance.

I returned to Samsung after almost 5 years.
Cons.
1.Exynos 7000 series processor is a let down for this phone.
2. After using MI Max2 I felt a slowdown of around 40% in this phone.
3. If you lock this phone with some app open then it sometimes stays blank for a while when unlocking again.
4. Fingerprint reader is a huge let down sometimes. You feel like stamping the phone on ground sometimes.
5. Camera is ok as it does not give out photos which you can boast about.
6. Sometimes have felt network issues. Still need to get sure about this as the phone is perfectly updated. Even checked at Samsung Service Centre.

Verdict.
Buy this phone as per your areas of interest and do not go by the Samsung legacy.

I love the fact first of all that Samsung is  very user friendly ...also  its a very budget friendly phone which gives you specs that are very efficient in a price that is affordable.
 The 5000 MAH battery is the biggest pull for me it lasts a good day half two days after extensive usage.
The  phone is not a hybrid ..thank god!! it has  two sim slots as well as memory card slot which is very important because  if it were a hybrid it would mean it would come with some constraints as there would be one less slot...so I prefer it to be as it is as I can use both my SIM cards in the phone and have an extended storage capability which goes up to 512 GB . The cameras r ok as they r obviously cameras that r in budget I am still trying to figure them out....lol...
What's most impressive in this phone for me is it's user friendliness and all the little Samsung apps that come along with it .....i didn't have to spend much time figuring stuff out and u can easily move stuff from Ur internal storage to Ur SD card if u wanna free up space  some many more things like fingerprint scanner face recognition......etc..... all in all it's value for money I have rotated around quiet a few mobile brands these last couple of years.....but I'm glad I'm back with Samsung ......🥰

A slight lag in processing speed, Battery backup is not up to mark.  A moderate use and battery lasted (15-16hrs), else everything met the expectation.  The major thing people miss about this smart fone is SAR value.  It come with SAR value of  minimal 0.409 W/Kg ,  and people tend to ignore this over other flashy features of mid range smartfone.  Guys long term health comes first. If any one is rejecting this fone due to processor speed then kindly go for higher variant.  A good fone for premium feel in HAND

Edit 1). After 20+ days usage.
A) Battery life varies from 15 to 30 hours . DEPENDS on heavy to light usage.

2) Processor works fine. I use to play Asphalt 9, angry birds 2.  For about 2-3 hours continuously . Minimal heating and normal battery drainage and minimal of no lag  found.

3) The SAR valise is its highlight as it is minimum.

4) Auto brightness sometimes fails to accomodate the external condition.  This is the only major defect I found in this device till yet.

5) As I am using 6gb ,128 GB VARIANT SO it is enough space to run many background applications. Memory optimisation feature is highlight in the device.

6) External 3.5 mm jack working fine.
7) Bluetooth working fine.

After searching for an entire eternity, found this phone - Samsung Galaxy M30 and I couldn't believe the price! Thanks Samsung for looking out for fellows like me! Can you believe that you're getting 3X features  phone under 18K??

The marvellous display caught my attention like no otherphone the Super AMOLED FHD+ Infinity U Display of this phone with a screen size of 16.21cm (6.4") gives you the best visuals ever, with vibrant colours and sharp contrast! And you can view all the content in HD as this phone is enabled with the widevine L1 feature.
The juiced-up battery and fast charging features are like every tech lover's dream!
Guys, let's face it - low battery is the most heart-breaking thing to see when you are out, This new phone is equipped with a 3X fast charging feature and it comes with a 15W charger., this phone runs on a 5000 mAh battery, so, binge-watch shows or play games on the go without worrying about your phone's battery getting exhausted.

This smartphone is equipped with a 13MP + 5MP + 5MP Ultra Wide Triple Rear camera for a good angle of view.  just needed a camera like this to capture every moment of my life.

Usage experience of 6 months:
Processor is bit lazy to work multiple apps-Samsung has provided the software update twice in last six months, still cannot solve the issues.
Camera is extra smooth which fades out reality of image. Front camera not works as expected and too bad in dim lighting places
Display has worked out nice.
Not fast charging, lasting long.
Battery life is best for nonstop uasge of 6-7 hrs include pubg, in normal usage lasts for 2 days.
At last for the price of M30(12000) we can expect best improvements in M30 to survive in market.
Finally Amazon offers fast delivery and reliable products for the customer.

The only thing you hate about this mobile is that, the slowness, you find slowness each every apps you open or even while using Google maps, I'm not pubg gamer, but I use Google maps a lot.

Surely you will feel irritated when you are in hurry to open and use apps.

Reg, battery life it is amazing, a non gamer will at least 24 hours of battery life.

Camera is pretty good.

Face unlock will be slow but faster than S9+ ( which I should not compare, since S series have been flagship models)

Finger print is not disappointing.

VERDICT : The SLOWNESS, is the biggest disappointment. However, the battery life is pretty compromising, you have HEATing issue when MOBILE DATA is ON.
Let's hope this phone doesn't slows down after a year.

After 4 months review:
The phones is quite the charmer with the almost bezeless design with  those fading colors blending into the backside of the phone but...Ouch!! put a case...yup.. Its Plastttttttiii...
The battery is decent unlike those older Samsung phone batteries under this price range...it will last you a day at ease.
The camera is Goodish.. because of the old friend "exposure" problem and too much AI Pickering here and there...but most of the phones under this price segment suffers the same fate... so its NORMAL.
The best thing about this phone is the display...so smooth and clear...and it brings out the child in me.
The performance is moderate... pubg or Mobile legends can be played smoothly but not for long long duration...And besides it is  not healthy to play that long too..
If you want a phone from a good Brand, Good performance, Good camera, Not that expensive, Good design, Good display then you might want to give it a shot... won't regret it... yup...i said it

Even though samsung didn't released GALAXY M30
in stores.... It gained a huge response. I searched for many smart phones.... And finally ended up For GALAXY M30... even though I didn't fixed my heart for it.. I seen the specifications... Once in 6hrs. ....i didn't turned up...... Just fixed for it....
I bought it....

While i was opening the seal of the SMARTPHONE GALAXY M30, some unknown feeling wrecked my mind..... Wheather It will meet my expectations..
It blowed my mind.... What a back finishing. It was..

The ultra wide camera... gave a perfect look to the normal viewing lens... ..I have attached a photo... I took with GALAXY M30 below...

Fingerprint  reader.... suited.. ad for the user's wants.

I will be online all the  time.. Viewing youtube etc...

One time charge last for at least one and half day.....

Thanking you GALAXY M30.

with its incredible.... Brain washing features

this phone is very good I really like it the camera quality is very good and the best thing I like in this phone that battery battery battery is very good if you have only 10% battery also then also it can go up to 1 day.
and charger is very good it will take only 1.5 hours to charge full and the camera quality is also very good but face unlock is not too much good as compared to others but fingerprint is very much good.
and the design of the metallic body is also very glory and very fancy...
Atlas Amla to tell that smile is very good if you want to buy then you can get up purchase mobile from 8999 only in the Diwali sale in which I have got 1000 discount on SBI debit card.
So if you want to buy then you can buy this phone is extremely very much good .

Thanks!!!!!!

The camera quality, display and usability of this phone is awesome. Battery life is also good. However, the biggest drawback is that almost all of the phones have one or other manufacturing defect. I ordered one earlier which had to be returned due to issues with mike. The new one that I received has heating issues- gets very warm when using it for calls lasting longer than 5 mins. I have sk heard about many such cases from friends and family. At this price range, such issues are not acceptable.

The only problem i see is heating. It gets heated even for a basic use i.e. is on calls. 15 mins in call and the phone upperside will heat up so badly that it will be difficult to continue using the phone. Its so damn uncomfortable and dangerous. This appears to be a flaw in the handset which Samsung doesnt agree to. I am trying to return my phone but its just too difficult for us to make these big companies realise that even Indians expect quality product. Its high time they start doing this.

It's very wrost product from Samsung. Camera quality very poor as compared to j6 ,j8 . I am promising I will never buy Samsung product in future. Dear friends  kindly compared ones with  j8 . Samsung Making us fool. Speaker quality of M30 ,a30 is very bad . AlsoThere is no option to zoom in/ out during camera operation .

Worst when it comes to image stabilisation. Indoor and low light photos are useless. Outdoor and brightly light room pics are decent. Battery is average. Camera app needs a lot of improvement - not sure how dual or triple camera works as you cannot adjust background after clicking photos whereas Nokia has that feature inbuilt as it snaps the reference of dual camera which holds the feature of adjusting background even after the photo is clicked.

Made a wrong choice considering 15k price was expecting better camera performance.

Other features are ok.

Great phone at such a price with dual Sim and memory card slot . Battery life and display are the USP of this phone . Reliability of Samsung and light weight are other advantages . Also phone is pretty fast for gamers .

Youtube videos are best to view as the phone is used by my wife , even a decent phone for insta . Also it dosent have any heating problems like past samsung`s phone used to be. Only flak could be the loudspeaker of the phone.

Rest i must say best to Buy.

Overall a good device to buy. The screen is one of the best you can get in this segment (sAMOLED), but a bit dim in direct sunlight. Cameras do a decent job in most conditions. Recently got updated to Android 9 Pie so thats a plus. Battery of 5000 mAh is a monster and the battery life is impressive.
The only drawback I see is the processor which is a bit underpowered when compared to other devices in the segment. But you won't feel any difference in day to day use.
The device was delivered on the time specified so no complaints there.

Giving reviews after 3 months of using it, the Phone is literally good for the price, 128gb internal memory with 6gb ram and with 2 sim and sd card slots, triple camera, 5000mah battery etc. But after using it carefully not dropping it hard, i had an issue few days back the mobile sim network was not working and checked it into Samsung store and got hardware(mother board) replaced felt bad like for just for 3 half months of using it faced such issue! Maybe my bad luck, But due to the warranty got claimed with INR.00 and using it to normal!

1st I'am Samsung brand lover.
Overall phone is it's best.but when i inserting sim cards the tray is not coming out l tried 20to 30 times after tray comes out one of the cheapest sim tray I never seen in Samsung brand pls check the overallphone before delivering to customers.
Performance - overall to my uses it's amazing.
Camera quality - just wow selfie cam.
Battery - this is the reason i never seen such a battery backup in Samsung using all over day.
Display - mindblowing&amp;stunning when watching movies YouTube on this screen never you got this experience in this price range.

Good phone in low budget with almost major features inbuilt. Most amazing part is the battery. You dont have to worry about battery getting dry at the end of the day as it supports battery for 2 consecutive days. Its so because I attend almost more than 500 calls a day and the battery supports my cell for 2 days consecutively.

Hey people! Purchased the Samsung Galaxy M30 on the great indian festival sale. Most of the pros are mentioned in the product details itself so I'll get straight into the cons

1) Battery :- for the first time samsung delivers a battery worth 5000 mah., which may seem HUGE, but it's not. The battery drainage is less compared to my previous samsung galaxy On7 prime, but I still need to charge it once a day. Thankfully samsung has provided with a type C fast charger so it takes 2 hours to fully charge the phone to a 100% compared to the 4 hours in the previous phone.

2) Camera :- quality is not good enough. The triple camera so highly spoken of is more or less just for show-off. I see no difference than the camera of on7 prime

3) packaging and accessories :- it's horrifyingly dissapointing to see samsung not delivering their top notch headphones anymore with every phone. Even the charging USB is a little small. The sim tray is very delicate so I'll advice users to be very very careful, it might break. The battery is fixed so I have no clue hoe much I'll have to pay once the battery issues begin (which is a very common feature for samsung phones after one year of use)

4) In built apps and storage :- one of my greatest complains to any samsung phone is the unnecessary eating away of space with apps that are not even needed. My phone has helo, my airtel, cloud, flipkart, amazon, snapchat, messenger which is absolutely unnecessary for me. When I look into the storage I see only 53 GB available out of 64 GB, and with the in built apps , the available space for me is a mere 28 GB. I would highly recommend to scape the in built apps. One can easily download them from playstore.

So I guess that more or less sums it up. It's certainly a very good phone for its price range still I'll recommend spend a little more to purchase the A series phones. They're more long lasting I feel. I use samsung cause it's much more reliable than an Mi, OPPO, VIVO, or ASUS. Rest is your call!😊

Got this phone around a month ago. My earlier phone was moto g5s plus. I am a moderate user of phone who keeps on hanging with internet and all the required essential  apps, I also  play games at times.

Now what good about m 30 for me is:
1. Premium  software quality with no ads.
2. Excellent display.
3. Better performance  compared to my moto phone. This was where I surprised even though on papers this phone has not very powerful processors but still it gives it's best when comes to background  app management. I have not felt any heating issues or lag issues even after using heavy apps for hours!
4. Good front camera.
5. Excellent  battery  life . Comes around 2.5 days for me.

Some cons:
1. Even though primary camera is good. But does not give it's best in low light.
2. Yes its software is premium with ad free but i was expecting Samsung UI 1 which is available  in A series.
3. Speaker could have been amplified more.

Overall a very practical  phone which gives u a premium  feel especially  due to its display.

Many people compare this with redmi note 7 pro. I agree note 7 pro is a good phone which has better processor but you cannot feel the same premium experience as m 30 here is why:
1. Just compare the both display!
2. Check out note 7 apps filled with full ads.
3. Even though they claim 48 mp it's not always! it it gives u in pro mode with no zoom option.
4 microphone and headset audio of m 30 is better.
5. Note 7 is a perfect phone for teen agers who is more intrested in gaming or heavy usage. M 30 is for professional  and moderate  users who are more intrested in quality for primary usage of phone.

All the hype around this phone is not warranted.
1. The phone is way too big for handling and is not good.  The one handed handling is clumsy
2. The battery takes forever to charge and the quick charger is not a quick charger
3.  The batter does not last long and even the minimal functioning of the phone needs a lot of power
4. The phone is very heavy and does not fit into your pocket unless you are a giant
5. Here is the fun part .. the screen is totally unprotected and will break even if you drop it casually.  yes, mine broke.

This is a long term review. It's more than 6 months I have been using this phone
Pros: good battery life and the out of the box fast charger, an average user can last upto 2 days .
  - Good camera , specially out door in sunlight.
  - display quality good
  - fingerprint sensor is good
Cons: very poor processor. Lags many times in simple operations
 - face unlock is very slow
 - the Android version used on this mobile is the worst as I see the basic feature of calling take 2 secs to initiate a call.
 - backpanel is so delicate that it gets scratched very easily
- camera in video mode have no options like timelapse , boomerang etc

Overall dont buy this phone or Samsung phones at all
Overpriced and not worth it.

The phone is incrideble in this price point.... first of all

Let's start with display the superamoled 1080p beats the competition by miles... It is the only phone to have 1080p amoled screen in sub 15k price point while others uses IPS LCD panels which are not great... Have terrible viewing angles and suffers from backlight issues
Yeah! I'm taking about you redmi note 7 pro

Then the cameras are stunning ... What amazes me is the way Samsung exposes photos perfectly unlike the competition... I do wish it had 4k recording...and the exynos7904 so it is something that Samsung should do with software update... Front camera is really great for selfies

Battery life is OMG... It easily lasts for 2-3 days easily with moderate usage... And 15 w fast charging is great bonus unlike 10w charging that you get with other phones in this price point

Then the performance is excellent.. very snappy phone ....even though redmi note 7 pro has little bit powerful processor compared to m30 in paper, truth is that redmi note 7 pro stutters in really day life and all animations and transitions are choppy... Which ruins the experience and you can play games like pubg and all smoothly...

Then the extras
 build quality is good not but as premium as note 7 pro as it has glass back but that will make it surely more durable... And also phone heats little after playing these graphics intensive games because of the plastic back

The mic quality is far better on m30 than any other phones in price points

Despite have mono speaker sound quality is nice and clear even at high volumes and the headphone output that you get with this phone is amazing...

One ui is great and beats the competition ... There is no ads and slow downs and it's asthetics are nice and also offers nice amount of customisation so that's a win...

It got all sensors that you need in a  smartphone and the whole package is great... fingerprint sensor is nice and fast , face unlock is nice but not that secure... Phone is light weight and typing and interacting with the phone is great because of curved sides...

I got it for 12600 after 10% sbi bank discount which makes it cheaper than redmi note 7 pro, realme 5 pro, and mi a3. Damn I hate seeing word pro using in smartphone...

Anyway I recommend you to buy this phone eyes closed as it's that great!😃

It is a very nice device if you are looking for long battery life, good display and you like playing games like PUBG, Clash of Clans, IAF - A Cut Above, etc. Samsung is providing regular security updates, which is very nice. With these updates, the only drawback is my phone started to slow down. It was a UI update. Seems this last update in December was not meant for this phone. Samsung can improve more on their processor.
The camera quality is ok. Works good in natural lights, not so good in artificial lights.
The fast charger is quite good.

I am unhappy with Samsung that they released M30S two months after I purchased this. WOuld have gone for M30S, it has more battery.

Its been week using this mobile and happy to have long lasing battery and nice camera. But extremely surprised that this phone has severe signal issue. I have compared lot of mobile phones around me and of different companies, i am going to approach customer service for the same. One of my friend is facing the same issue with the M30. Samsung has to address this issue.

I bought it for normal use and kind of photography I love it's everything. I have attached some photos so you'll know how good is its cam I love it personally.

Feedback

feedback
-People say camera but I find it's too good.

Speed - you can't play any online games it will be very slow.
Earphone -is not available.
Company has provided headphone because given Rs.16990.00 amount its very sadbig amount not prvide one headphone Samsung company  .low amount key pad mobile in box available in headphone its very company is chiting to costumers
And chargers cable are very small lenth its not using any switch board where is stand placed.

Cam-Good, Totally it is an average product, you can use for only calls and watching movies, Phone contains fiber body, we have to handle carefully.

To my usage of this phone is been excellent after using it since last 5 months nonstop, i love the battery life which it lasts, gives me a backup upto 2 - 2 and half day. The performance of this phone has been so far great without any hung or slowness, i use almost 60+ apps. I'm sure if use more than 100+ the performance doesn't drop. The camera quality is also great but not excellent as it has its own limitation, the voice, data, network, fingerprint reader &amp; security is been great without any kind of disturbance.

Overall a great phone with lot of features and options. Suggest all the medium users to buy without any hesitation.

Whatever feature you want is available in this phone. Trust me, the display is perfect for this price range, compared to other mobile brands. The 13 megapixel camera seems 23 to me, such a good quality! And probably the most amazing thing is its sound quality in headphone. The output both by Dolby and Soundalive provides an amazing experience in sound. And it gives me a battery backup of 4-5 days. So if you are finding a phone just for youtubing, whatsapping, facebooking, googling, or capturing photos or mp3ing, I am sure you are searching for the best phone for this price range. I cannot say about gaming because I'm not a gaming person. Thanks to Samsung for providing such a good handset.

I have used this phone almost a month and I find it best in this price bracket.

@Speed: It is completely standing on expectation as it has 6 GB ram which makes all the process super fast.

@Screen: Size of screen is perfect and resolution is good. For keep care of your eyes it also gives blue filter.

@Battery Life: I really amazed and love this most, In simpler uses I charge the phone in 2 days. If you are fed up with your draining battery then this is perfect choice for you.

@Camera Quality: There is three back camera which gives you opportunity to click wider frame. But quality of pic is not like S8 or S10.

@Front Camera: Front camera is very powerful and will give you satisfactory photographs.

@Charging: It comes with fast charger and get charged quickly.

@Weight: Phone weight is ok and wont irritate you.

@Built quality: Phone built quality is smooth but it is not robust as it is made of plastic.

My verdict: Overall phone is value of money and this price point it is super worthy. Go for it. :-)

The mobile is not satisfactory as per the specifications.
Battery backup ok. 1 day backup. (Not satisfactory as compared to spec 5000mah)
Back Camera below average. Front camera ok.
Display good. Overall not upto the expectation.
The delivery from Amazon was a mess. Got delayed delivery after 20+ follow ups. Actually Amazon lost the phone and hence it was delayed!

Phone seems to be perfect whether its battery life performance. ABSOLUTELY  STUNNING!!!
 Screen is just awesome. The screen is that big that sometimes it gets difficult  to drop the notification  panel when you use it by one hand but but but no complaints. Phone with just 17000 range and with 6gb variant with 128gb storage you need to go for it. Worth every penny. Whether its listening  to music watching movies on Netflix.  It works great. Battery last for a complete day even if u keep mobile data on for whole day.I am heavy user still it last for whole one day. Go for it. CAMERA Quality  is also good dont worry.

Excellent package and on time delivery. Bought two M30 phones for my parents. Really good overall performance, great battery life and the Super AMOLED display is just fantastic. Heard many reviews about the poor performance while gaming. I wasn't concerned about that, as my parents will only be using it for basic calling, taking photos, making Watsapp and video calls. Very good phone in 14000 Budget for a mid range user, if you are looking to buy a "Samsung" phone at this price.

Pros:Powerful battery, Good front camera ,amoled display, smooth running
Cons:Relatively less better back camera compared to note7pro,Cant play pubg more than 3 times in a row coz it heats a little bit.
Buy it unless you are pubg addict except that it is stupendous in every aspect.Fingerprint is fast, face recognition works even when u close eyes which is a flaw and any one can open it if u r sleeping.

I like battery performance ,  display quality , design and In hand feeling , Samsung gives in M30 most every features and it's ONE UI makes it more cool looking device in its dark mode , I love it . But I don't like picture quality of camera and detailing so much I'm little disappointed here , meanwhile camera performance is pretty good in capturing pictures like shutter speed and HDR. In gaming performance is also very decent no lags I found playing PUBG, Asphalt , Smash It .

so overall it's a Good phone for me.

A best budget phone with amoled display and dolby atmos . Biggest pro is the phone's  display and battery life easily stands for 1 and a half day despite heavy usage . Never lags even with multiple apps open , call clarity is great  . Only thing i have found wrong is that finger print reader is around 2 or 3 micro seconds slow . Thats the only thing . Have not done heavy gaming like nova 3 , moderate games fare very well .even if u keep on playing for 3 hours straight and the phone doesnt get heat up or all.  I havent used the camera that much so i cant comment on that aspect. Overall its a steal at this price. Would have preferred the stock android experience  but hey you cant have it all

Camera is very bad, images taken from phone is very blur and color shades are very different from actuals. It's 16MP but very poor quality of pictures, even 12 MP photo is very good infort of 16MP camera Pic.
Now a days our phone work as our camera and we use it for every work and never carry cameras, but I am disappointed with this product where I had spent 14k ok mobile.
And very worst thing is I am not able to return as well on Amezone as it's new phone in market.
Badly wasted my hard earn money.
Dear friends, if you want good quality photos, then don't go for it.

Thank You !❤️

Awesome! Have been using it for more than a month now. No issues. Beautiful display, finger print sensor is good. I don't play games, so can't review the processor, but for my use it is perfect. You would love watching video on it because of display. It also has Dolby Atmos sound which is great. Only thing missing is gorilla glass protection. You will need to buy a tempered glass for it. Already got android pie update within a month of buying.

Its the best phone in this particular segment great battery life and the screen is best in the market. watching a movie or video is fun on this bright super amoled  even charging takes less time than many others available and also it feels premium than other cheap phones which are just focusing on false ads on net and tv .
It has the balanced hardware and software specially samsung customisation is better in many ways so go for it you will never regret it😊😊😊

I am a genuine buyer of this phone and really astonished to see so many good reviews of this phone. I had to sell it one week later at a loss of 4k on cashify.
Firstly I don't like that yellowish tint on screen which all Samsung phones have-- this one too has it.
The camera quality is the real disappointment specially in indoor lights, they have failed to develop proper algo to interlace the pics from 3 cameras properly. Oppo and Vivo phones in same range offer 45 MP camera and have much better picture quality.
Processor is also not satisfying, it's some old age one. Playing pubg with reduced graphics is the only option.
Finger sensor is inferior to other same range phones... though it takes 1 sec to open the phone but practically 1sec is quite annoying. Others do it much faster.
Amazon did not give any option to return it within 10 days and neither was I allowed to post any review earlier so posting it now after 2-3 months of it's launch.
GOOD THINGS:
Battery life is really great, it lasts for at least 2-3 days.
Screen resolution and picture quality is very good.
Lookwise it is a decent one.

I have been using this mobile since 1month..personally i feel this is one of the best mobile in this cost..I got this mobile for 17k from Amazon..first asset of this mobile is battery,,,on avg  u can use this for 2days with optimum charge with mobile data on..camera quality is ok..don't expect much at this cost...u can click beautiful pics if u r good at camera settings...probably I m not,,so it's ok for me...finger print sensor is good,make sure not to have dust on sensor,so that it delays in unlocking the mobile ,,while unlocking the mobile front camera also plays good and fast ....if u r not using mobile cover then the mobile looks stylish in ur hand,,but screen guard is necessary...in this one month it has fallen thrice from my hand but stillnjo cracks or dent...I m planning to gift my sister M20 model....I m highly satisfied with this samsung M30 model....

I have always been a Samsung user and am always appreciating Samsung for their amazing services.
I was looking for a new device and I was very head bent on the Samsung M30 the day I saw it.
I am using the 4 + 64GB version in blue and it works just so well!!
I am very happy with my device and recommend it to everyone looking for something in the price range.
The 50000 mAh battery is just so helpful and very rare in mobiles, with normal usage on Wifi I get upto 3 full days of battery backup!
And also you can fully charge the phone with the fast charger from 0 to 100 in just 2-3 hrs!
The features are just unlimited and the device feels actually premium to use.
An added feature of Samsung is that the phone damage can be repaired almost anywhere you are and it won't even cost you much.
Plus Samsung is both, durable and reliable, even with the 4GB RAM I can play games with a lot of clarity!
The device also doesn't heat up!
The screen is vivid and almost every setting can be customized very easily and effectively for every person.
The Samsung in-built apps might seem like a burden, but if you turn off the notifications, they're really helpful in gaming and multitasking!
I have never experienced any system error in this device, if I have got any, it is due to some error I made, for which I was helped by the Samsung online chat service step by step.
Samsung phones also have many many in-built features like antivirus, automatic cache memory cleaner and device booster that improve the performance of the product.
With smart view one can connect easily to almost any TV set for screen mirroring. And the camera quality is just so cool! I don't even need to search for wallpapers, I can easily just take out my phone, look for a scene I like and click!
Whatever I say is less, this phone is a must buy!
The best choice ever!!

Hi

Sharing review after having tough times with this phone.
I bought this product though within a week experienced heating problem and suddenly phine gets off. I had asked amazon care for an exchange and after having a strong discussuion of nearly 1 hour convinced to replace this product on its last day of exachange.

After having an exchange product color was not the same what i had ordered in my first order still thought not to have another argument for it. The replaced product is working fine without having heating problem or anything though not heavy used like gaming.. this leads me might earlier one was a faulty product.
I would not highly recommend this even my whole family is having samsung :) you can go for A50 which would be the better one than this
Overall phone is decent to use only if you're not installing heavy applications or games.

It is the worst mobile phone I have used ever. Within one week of purchasing it started to trouble. I auto restarts without any warning and many times it's screen freezes and you have to hard boot to restart it then only it starts working again but may restart many times in this process. Also it has 6 GB RAM but the way it works it seems it has only 1 GB RAM. My advice to you all please don't buy this product, it's totally  waste of money to buy it.

Got this phone in second sale through amazon. Pheew... that was a day.. almost didn't get it due o high demand.

Good things
-Amoled display.
-5000 MAH battery and runs 2 days on power saving mode and 1 day with general use.
-Fast charging and 15W charger in the box.
-Wide angle camera is awesome.
-No heating no lagging.
-Face unlock is very fast.
-Awesome design.
-Very low radiation
-Blue light filter
-Lock screen story and stunning pics.

Cons
-Camera's image stabilization and low light images can be improved.
-Little slippery in hand but trust me a 99 Rs cover solved it straight away.
-Online availability.(Now in stock)
-No splash proof (as per the other reviews as I am not going to test this anyway?
-Hard to find a good screen protector.

Feedback

-People compare with Mi but forget that China model with LCD display and 0.9 SAR value. M30 has SAR of 0.43

Well after 5 moths of use - I am completely satisfied with the phone and even recommended to few friends who are also happy with their decision.

1. Overall, the UI is fantastic. Extremely sharp. I did a side by side comparison with a friend's OnePlus 6 and a RedMI Note 7 Pro. W.r.t. price, I think it is at least a couple of thousands more that what should ideally be.

2. Camera is good. I am not really an avid camera user. I use it only to scan documents and a few images. So at least on my low expectations, it performed well.

3. One of the negatives of the phone is the finger print sensor. It is too flat at the rear of the phone. So, often you'll have to look behind to place your finger there. The other thing that sort of disappointed me is the senstivity of the sensor. It takes a little more than a second or two for the phone to get unlocked if using sensor.

This phone looked so good when I unboxed it..but within 2 days it began to show clear signs of poor craftsmanship. My phone would show me false connectivity prompts of USB connected.  It would appear and disappear consecutively. At times, it won't charge at all.

 I took it to authorized service center. They said the display too is flawed and can't be calibrated.  They repaired it and now fingerprint sensor is not working at all. Bad manufacturing combined with worse service are sure ingredients of the worst experience.

I had only heard of faulty Samsung phones infamous for almost every kind of goof up possible in smartphone industry but this time I experienced it myself. Chinese makers have far better benchmark than Samsung phones.

I really liked this phone. Because Such A brand like Samsung provides one of best Smartphones in the budget category under 10000 Rupees.
Pros.
1. First is first the appearance, mainly the display with sAMOLED gives better picture quality with optimized brightness and contrast gives a vibrant viewing experience.
2. Next the battery life is very amazing and super long lasting with one full charge a moderate user like me can use 2 days.
3. Rear Camera is not a deal breaker but the Front Camera is pretty good. When using wide angle camera the photos becomes more softer and blurred and lack of details.
4. Fast charger is really really good. It charges the phone very rapidly.
5. USB C port and fast charger providing in the box is really nice thing.
I'm not a gamer so I can't explain it.

Cons.
1. The fingerprint sensor doesn't gives a vibrating feedback, so we need to assure the phone that is unlocked by looking into the display.
2. The rear panel of the phone is plastic and also it is in a cheaper design, I brought the stainless black which gets scratches easily so you better need a back cover.

Design n display: the design is very good built if not best. Display is awsm,the sAmoled display is doing its job perfectly.
Perfomance: the phone works very smooth widout lag,although it is a bit battery consuming type processor
Battery: it is real beast 5000 mAh makes up for the processor,u get upto full 2 day battery life with medium usage n upto a little more than 1 day with heavy gaming n all. The fast charge feature ensures u get battery charged whenever u want(it takes approx
20 min to charge the battery 15% to 100%)
Camera: the rear camera gives a real beauty....a variety of options alongwith wide angle shots. The front camera is also awsm with high quality pics n videos although slow motion isnt there as in A series
Cons:
Short charging cable
Handling it is a bit confusing(specially for storage permission of apps)
Flash operates in adequate light( in auto mode) sometimes
No screen guard provided
Overall it is a really brilliant device n u can surely go for it as it is also within budget

Giving my review after 1½ Month and totally frustrating
Worst phone ever I seen yet, getting restart again and again 8 to 9 times in a day
Its pathetic when you doing something important.
Visited Samsung care as well they ensured that problems is fixed but still frustrating no change in condition.
Don't buy you can get much better in same cost.
Although camera quality is good but it doesn't matter if it's getting restart while taking photo/video

Writing this after using about a month or so! No issues as of now!
One of the best mid-range smartphones I'd say!
Triple camera, 5000 mAh battery, 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, fingerprint, face unlock with one UI, all of these for a price of 17k; I'd say go for it!

I have been using this phone for about last one and a half month, this is no good in comparison to my earlier Redmi Note 7. Apps keep stopping every time you try to open an app. The positive side is excellent rear and front camera and battery which lasts for almost two days with moderate use.
Waste of money.

Overall, this is an ok ok purchase. Got it for 17999 (6 + 128 variant). Prior to this, I was using redmi 5 and I would say, my old phone outperforms this in some areas. The chipset in this phone is exynos, which is not exactly the best when others have snapdragon. The phone does not feature an IR blaster, nor the package includes any covers (something redmi phones at lesser price always do). The battery 5000 mAh Li-Poly, which is not exactly a power house and is comparable to 3300 or 4000 mAh li ion. Fingerprint is a little laggy when compared to other phones at the same price range and is slower than redmi 5 I bought an year ago.having said that, I still like the very Samsung features such as the LED display, voice quality and gradient design.

Exceptional battery life, okay charging speed.
One of the best displays you can have in the segment.
An ultra wide camera is hard to find in this class.
Good portraits, really nice selfies.
Dedicated microSD slot.
THE PHONE IS GREAT FOR PEOPLE LOOKING FOR BIG BATTERY AND A NICE SCREEN SIZE THE COLOURS OF THE AMED DISPLAY ARE MAGNIFICENT A DAYS CHARGE IN TWO HOURS MOREVER BATTERY LAST MORE THAN A DAY WITH HEAVY USAGE THE CAMERA IS ANOTHER STAR IN THIS PHONE ESPECIALLY THE ULTRAVIDE ANGLE LENS IS REALLY AMAZING BUT LOWLIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY IS LITTLE DISTURBING THE FINGERFRINT SENSOR CAN BE LITTLE FASTER.OVERALL A VALUE FOR MONEY DEAL

I was searching for a Good budget phone which is not Chinese ... For some reasons i always doubt the intentions of a chinese company with  public data...

With that in mind I eliminated  wall chinese phones, leaving behind a few handful..

I was confused between Samsung a50 and m30s , but since m30s is a new phone with bigger battery i went ahead with buying ...

Battery is  awesome... Camera is ok, display is good... overall satisfied with it

Superb mobile...for a middle class person,

the most important thing-its battery losts for more than 24 hours with full time 4g network on....and for full charging it takes hardly less than 2 hours only....so no need to put the mobile on charger at night time...wakeup and put it on the charger...get ready for your duty ... by the time it gets 100% charge... thanks to tyoe c charger...

Storage and ram is more than needed

Camera quality is acceptable for the common uses... during night or in low light it is somewhat  low quality...

Amoled screen is excellent...touch screen is smooth and comfortable...

Android pie with one UI give smooth performance with out any lagging... processor could be a higher version...but practically it wont give much problem.
People who are interested in pubg games may feel some fuzzy

Style &amp; look...it is classic as well as modern...

Finally the price-  it is acceptable and affordable

The phone itself is good package , still there are cheaper models available in other brands with same Configuration . I chose Samsung owing to the Brand Trust 🤐.
The Phone worked fine for 10 days ( replacement window ) and than suddenly CAMERA STOPPED WORKING😮 . it gave all kinds of Nonsense errors.
And it was gifted to someone special , who is just too naive to understand that How can a NEW OUT OF BOX  phone act like this . 😣
Nevertheless the Visits were made to Service centres but alas!! nothing can be done untill phone is submitted to them .

Thereafter they will format the phone and than find out whats wrong and if person is not Having Makeshift Phone 1) He is without phone for all this time 2) How to take backup of phone again if person is Naive , somebodys got to do it for them .

Fed up I again invested 10k for A Redmi Phone for same Person and Now I have to deal with Samsung service centres . It was almost futile to Convince service Centre that they can directly open and check CAMERA but they are adamannt that FORMATTING is first step .

I am almost brand Loyal with Samsung TV , Washing Machine , Refrigerator and what not . But now onwards NO SAMSUNG !!!

A great phone with features what i was looking out for. My needs were
Good battery
Dedicated memory card slot
Double SIM
Reasonable camera for outdoors and selfies with friends
Good RAM and internal storage
Reasonably good processor.
Good display
Ease of use - good UI
Samsung Galaxy M30 ticked all my above requirements and is a great companion. I can down load as many apps without fear of space. I am not a gamer so processing speed is fine for my browsing requirement. Now upgraded to Android Pie. Very happy with the buy.

Awesome phone for this price range. Excellent screen resolution, single time charging lasts through the day for me. Fast charger comes with the pack with USB type c. Cool camera features.. Selfie camera doesn't flip the images, a tiny drawback.
Great value for money. Thankful to Amazon for the quick and seamless delivery.

The back looks really classy!! Surely one of the best phones to buy within 18000. But the fi gerprint scanner takes time to operate, like a second or two. The camera has a good wide angle but needs improvement in the quality. Grains in the phoyos can easily be noted. The camera needs significant improvement in the night mode because the images are pretty bad with the flash in dark. The phone can easily maintain high end graphic games along with other apps running as secondaries. The battery backup is good and a single charge with decent use of playing online games and movies can give a phone a life of 2 days. Dats really good right??
Samnsung needs to manage the auto-update of its apps like samsung members and my samsung and give users the facility to cancel the updates. Software updates are good with  changes that make the phone better in every way possible. In total a decent phone to buy within 18000. I am happy buying it. Hope that u too will be..😊😊

I like it better than the m40 which my mom has mainly bcz of its super amoled display, its 5kmah battery nd of course bcz of the headphone jack which is tragically absent in d m40.... the camera quality is great and at this prices range the wide angle lens comes as the cherry on d top...... great fast phone nd amazing specs at this price range!

Superb bright amoled display, great battery life, no lag, good touch response. Looks wiser,
it is sleek. With moderate usage, the battery lasts over 3 days and I am extremely happy with that. Camera quality is ok but definitely could be better. Not sure why they have not put in a gorilla glass  but nevertheless the screen and display are great. Overall I would definitely rate the phone 5 stars for its price.

Pros :
1.Superb display:  with super amoled panel, very vibrant and also contains blue light filter to protect your eyes.
2. Great sound quality: bottom rocker is great and have quite crispy and clear sound.
3. Battery backup: trust me this is one of the best phones to have battery backup, with 5000 mAh battery and a fast charger included in box, it lasts easily upto 1.5 days.
4. Camera : the 13 megapixel sensor does good in outdoor and good lighting conditions, the wide angle shot is amazing.
5. Samsung service: you get stable and established brand to use with low SAR value and very good after sales service.
6. Extra memory card slot: you can expand your memory via micro sd card along with having 2 sim card simultaneously.
7. Super value for money: just 15k for samsungs super amoled display.
8. Always on display: its just awesome, the way you get to know the notifications without touching the phone, its really helpfull if you have this phone as primary phone.
9. Face unlock: the face unlock is supreme on this phone , as well the line of light glows continuously on the notch till it detects face.
10. Amazon service: superb packaging and rapid delivery.

Cons:
1. Polycarbonate back: bit fingerprint magnet also quite slippery.
2. Processor: weak as compared to sd 675, but equally well equipped to as sd636.
3. Optimisation and extra features: no ir blaster, also the UI skin is not that good.
4. Fingerprint reader: its a bit slow, not quite everytime unlocks in fraction of a second.

The most amazing feature of the phone is the screen and the display. The front camera notch is perfectly placed and it's very concised. The bezels are perfect. The battery life is ecstatic. I have played watched videos on YouTube for atleast an hour with only 7 percent of battery. Once I hadn't charged for almost 2 days and still with a lot of usage I still had 10 to 15 percent of battery charge left. The camera quality is amazing, both front and the back camera but the only drawback is that you have to compromise a little on the picture quality in a low light environment. Other than that the camera is great especially the wide angle picture quality is marvellous. The speed of the phone is actually great. Honestly, I have never experienced any lags so far, even while playing games like pubg which require a high processing speed. The design is the phone is literally jaw-dropping, that's the only way I can explain that. The fingerprint scanner works very well and it's fast roo but the only drawback is that your fingers should be quite clean. The user interface and the Dolby atmos feature is really good. ALL IN ALL SAMSUNG GALAXY M30 AT THIS PRICE SEGMENT IS A STEAL😉

So I have bought this phone from Amazon and thank you to Amazon as they delivered it before my expectations.

Though it's too early to write a complete review of the device but one thing that I noticed is the average camera quality of the phone. Those who are trying to buy this phone because of triple camera set up would be disappointed with the quality of images.

I will rather suggest them to go for redmi note 7s or Note 7 pro which is providing far better images in the same price bracket.

I have bought this phone to gift to my father and for battery and other reviews I need to wait  to hear from him.

I will surely update the reviews soon!

Thanks!

Have been using this phone since last 10 days and have charged only thrice although using on an average 5 hours a day..
.•♫•Battery•♫• is awesome and even in case of emergency battery saver mode give 6 hours juice at 20% .
.•♫•Camera•♫• is great although front camera soften the photo slightly more than required but still photo quality is good and rear camera is very good.
.•♫•UI •♫•  simple and useful.
.•♫•Security•♫• fingerprint is really fast but face unlock is a bit slow although it is working good even in full dark.
Charging time from 8%-100% took 2:15 minutes.
Phone is sleek but back panel is slippery a bit.. I think back panel could have been better..
.•♫•Display•♫• samoled display is superb and very much better than redmi phones having lcd display and you will feel that as soon as you will use the phone.
Bonus - not so much Preinstalled apps.
Highly recommended phone under 12000/-

Like-
Display quality
Design
Battery
Charger
Hidden features like Dolby atmos,blue light filter,many more

Dislike-
Running hard core games in low quality.
Camera is good but stability not so much while recording.
Face recognition is not perfect still good.

Recommended for those who love to watch videos,use only generic apps like WhatsApp fb insta,

Not for games like Pubg otherwise this phone has a edge in every aspect especially in display quality.

Fantastic Phone at this Price. It will be an upgrade from whatever phone you are using at present. This phone is not available in the market and is available only online. Sellers will try to tell you that they have comparable phones, but the cost is at least 4k more.

The Camera and the Battery are the USP (Unique Selling Point) of this Product. They are the best for Phones in this Range.

Amazon keeps changing the price, day to day of this product!! Also only Prime Members can avail of Exchange Offer. So look out for the Best deal.

Happy Buying.

Camera is huge -ve side for the phone, my 5 yr old 8mp Redme 1s will take better pic in any situation.
It can take OK pic under very bright light only. Totally unacceptable at this price range.

Good display
Fast and responsive in any situation
another minor -ve side, preloaded with loads of unnecessary apps

This phone is a combination of everything you need in a smart phone including the budget.
Its economical and classy. The super amoled screen wonderful and the vidoes are crisp. It also has the certification which helps us to watch HD movies on netflix. Its simply amazing. The camera performance is good and wide angle lens steals the show. A lot of detail can be fit into a picture because of the wide lens. The battery is a deal fixer. On a rough use it gives around 18 hours of power which is pretty impressive. And the other pros include size, out of the 6gb 5 gb is available. And the processor is also good.
So on a whole this is a wonderful phone from samsung and it is the best option to go.

Very good phone is this budget. Camera is good. Night photos are not upto the mark. Front camera n front flash photos are best. Battery life and fast charging is excellent.
My 3GB/32GB variant gets slow or lags deu to memory issues and smaller ram, you can go for higher ram n storage options. Best for midium users like calling, WhatsApp, video streaming and surfing as display is excellent. Gaming I would not suggest. Weight size and look is decently good. Best buy for this price

For a budget phone this is an incredible catch. The screen resolution is AMOLED and therefore is no doubt amazing. With 6GB of RAM and 128GB internal storage powered by the octa core Exynos processor, this phone packs the punch. Samsung has entered the budget phone arena with a statement. The infinity display combined with the screen resolution makes it one of the best phones. RAM allows you to play around with multiple applications and gaming becomes even more easier with the combination of the Octa core processor.

One limitation which if taken care of would have made this phone even better is the speaker quality. Though the ATMOS system does provide incredible sound experience while using headphones, the speakers when allowed to prove themselves fail miserably. If you are giving a 6 inch display, please don't expect the users to limit themselves to watching &amp; listening to videos only via headphones

The look and feel is ok. I liked the magnetic gradient black colour. Not so bezel less display. Color reproduction is good.

Camera quality is mediocre and not so impressive.

Overall an average phone. Most disappointing factor is over heating.  While using data, the display gets too hot, specifically near the ear piece area.  You can feel the heat in your ears if happened to attend call while browsing.

This makes me think if I should have gone for other phones.

After a week's use :
Added one more star.

Easy user interface, Smooth gaming, Smart apps, Processing Speed, Storage space, comfortable handling.

Over heating, average camera, poor call quality, low speaker volume, Ear piece sound is broadcasted all around -Caution : ppl around can easily over hear what we hear.

Thanks to Amazon ! 👍
The phone is definitely a True Value For money with great features.....
The mobile is definitely an eye-catcher due to its Premium finish, Slim body, Bezel less screen and the Double shaded back panel (I got a Gradation Blue Variant for me !)
The volume and power buttons are placed rightly and are easy to access.
Camers has 16 MP + 3 MP + 3MP Triple camera which captures Amazing shots !
With 7 different modes, you can choose the best one according to the scene being clicked. There's a button for Wide Angle which instantly widens the scene to be captured. I have attached the shots of the ceiling with and without Wide Angle Mode. Besides, the stickers and beauty modes work superb to get attractive selfie too.
6.4 inch Super AMOLED display is brilliant and a small U shaped notch adds to the attraction of its infinity display... The touch and interface is super smooth too and the brightness level is very efficient. You don't need to set it to full brightness when you are outside even in the afternoon.
With it's huge 4GB RAM and 64GB Storage, it's very easy to perform as many tasks as you want without any lag. The phone performs flawlessly without any lag or heating. You can activate Pop up window setting and it will make your Multi Tasking lot more easy and interesting too.
Battery sure is a huge one, i.e.5000mAh, but I didn't feel it sufficient enough to last for 24 hours even. Maybe, it's due to network issues or maybe I have to watch it again after some more charge..
The Face recognition works great !
Fingerprint sensor is quick and responsive.
The audio quality of the speaker and the earpiece is good.
Overall, I feel it is an Amazing phone in this price and I am very satisfied with it's overall performance. It completely justifies it's price. I would strongly recommend this device to everyone looking for a Superb mobile in a moderate budget. Go for it and Thank me later !

Thanks to Amazon for their fast delivery as always. I always find Amazon quite challenging themselves every day.

Comming to the handset it was a great to watch how samsung improved themselves from good for 1 year device company to a more budget category conscious company. These products really have good finish although very plastiky feel. In my case it was for my father-in-law who tries to keep himself updated with technology &amp; his answer to that is in his hand.

Pros :
1. Good visibility, display.
2. Network support and VoWifi
3. Low on heat problem
4. Camera photography
5. Battery service
Cons :
1. Reponsivity
2. Sluggish in app drawing
3. RAM management
4. Un-installable apps
5. Native browser eats a chunk of battery.

That's how it was found. But all in all good mobile handset until we pass a year to find.

After nearly 13 days of usage of Samsung Galaxy M30 I am writing this review. This phone is amazing in all aspects (ie) looks, camera, Performance and volume of media and ringtones and not to forget the Bahubhali Battery, and the wonder is it's with a 18w Quick charger. This phone can run for 1½ days to 2 days very comfortably with normal usage like calls, WhatsApp and music and YouTube streaming. Playing big sized games like PubG might drain faster. Otherwise 2 days is possible. I have used several phones before but this is one of the best now.
The Amoled screen gives an unmatched picture contrasting.  The camera pictures are also amazing even the indoor lighting and pitch dark images turned out good. The live focus feature gives the DSLR image result with perfect background blur. Even in the pitch dark your selfie come good as the Led screen brightens sufficientlyto enhance the picture. The volume usually is insufficient in a what'sApp video calling for many phones, this is the first experience where I had to reduce the Volume by 25 to 30 % as it was too loud. Also the music player is wonderful  but supports Dolby Atmos only in the Earphone or bluetooth modes as the phone come with only single side speaker. At this mid range pricing of Rs13990/- when you get a Samsung phone with a superb battery and camera and 4 GB ram,  I'll call it a "Killer deal.". I'm actually more than happy. So far No regrets.

I strongly not recommend samsung any more. Screen always on mode even press lock button. Software issue. Fast charge wont work. When i visit service center, they says water gone inside of mobile via charging point. Rediculas phone used on office desk how come water goes inside.. instead of repair on warranty asked me to pay 1000 Rs for repair. Veey bitter experience with samsung.

The device overall is a great performer, best device under 15k if you don't care about gaming and camera, there are better alternatives available for gaming and camera.
Pros:
1. Display: this device have an amazing super AMOLED display, best you can get at this price
2. Battery: awesome 5000mAh battery which will last for 2-3 days easily. Use dark theme, dark wallpaper to save more battery
3. Fast charging: 15W fast charging, device gets full charge within 2hrs
4: amazing build quality
Cons:
1. Weak GPU: m30 comes with exynos processor which have relatively weaker GPU than snapdragon SoCs so there are better alternatives at this price for gaming
2: camera: the cameras are great, not that bad, but you can get better alternatives at this price
Conclusion: It's a great device at this price, best for parents as they won't do much gaming, also 5000mAh battery with 15W fast charger's super AMOLED display, Samsung brand will be great for parents

Please take it back...

I have purchased this phone for Rs 12,600 &amp; initial experience was not so good as I have received a defect phone which is having a color patch on the screen.  So I have raised a complaint and amazon replaced it with a good one within 2 days.

Pros
1. Excellent screen &amp; vivid colors as this is a Super AmoLed Screen
2. Black is clearly black &amp; entire screen doesn't glow while displaying pics.
3. Camera is also reasonably good as it is having 3 cameras, but the pics are not so good in low light conditions.
4. Overalls look of the phone is good, as it is having all ports at the bottom side.
5. I am not a big fan of selfies, so I may not be the right person to judge the camera quality, but the pics are reasonably good.
6. Battery back is excellent, 1.5 days backup is guaranteed in normal usage conditions.

Cons
1. Fast charging is not that fast, it could have been better.  Something like Vooc flash charge.
2. Lack of speed while multi tasking.
3. Rear part of the phone is very slippery as it is having glossy finish.
4. I don't find any difference in bass even in Dolby Atmos is on.

But at the price tag of 13990, this phone is a better option than many other phones as it is having Super Amoled scree, 5000 mAh battery &amp; triple camera setup.

I've never invested more than 8k for the two  smartphones I've used. I'm also not a guy who repeatedly keeps changing phones. So when my previous phone started giving me minor issues, felt it was the right time to buy a new one and upon being suggested by my friend, choose the Samsung m30, 6Gb Ram, 128 Gb variant. It's almost been 3 months since I bought this phone. It's pretty much like all Samsung phones filled with a wide range of applications, user friendly UI etc coupled with few new features.

Pros.

1. Good camera- Front camera in particular is very good. Also the wide angle rear camera helps you to capture a wider picture.

2. Battery- Never ever did I think a smartphone would give a 24hr battery backup. I extensively use my phone for social media apps, netflix, Amazon prime etc but the battery life the phone has got is amazing. You won't even need a powerbank. You also get a fast charger which takes roughly 90 min for one full charge.

3. Lockscreen stories- This feature is something new I've come across but nonetheless, is pretty amazing. Helps you keep upto date with the current affairs stories you are interested in while the screen is locked.

4. Dolby atmos- Gives you a much better sound experience when using a headset. It is also categorised for various age groups and type of usage such as music, movies etc.

Cons.

1. Fingerprint sensor - It has been an issue as it doesn't detect your fingerprints sometimes.

2. Ringtone- Not sure whether the feature is same for all Samsung phones, but the ringtone automatically increases and decreases. From what I've read across the internet, I've come to know that it is a feature that works based on the surroundings you/the phone is in.

All in all, the phone is a decent buy for the price. Suggested for people whose usage is a lot and don't want their battery to drain quickly.

So the best part of the phone is that it gives maximum value at a minimum cost. I have been using it for over 5 months now.

It charges super fast, within a hour and the battery lasts for an entire day.

The camera quality is absolutely amazing. I have attached two pictures, one is a scenic shot and one is taken in dim lighting and as you can see the picture quality is great. In dim lighting, the best part is there is no glare.

It has a good deal of space and also does not lag. You can view files instantly and play games. Switching between apps is also smooth. The phone doesn't heat up that fast too.

The sound quality is also good, you can enable the dolby atmos mode when you listen to music by plugging in your earphones. For external speakers, the sound quality is good, but I think I would have preferred it to be a bit more louder.

The infinity U display is great for watching videos. When you watch video in youtube or amazon prime, you can pinch in and get the full screen mode.

As I have specs, I prefer to buy a phone with a blue light filter and this phone has one.

Overall, I would like to reinstate that it is great purchase and gives a lot of features for a lesser cost.

After nearly 50 days of usage. The charging has stopped working. The phone is not charging and the cable is not getting detected. First time I went for Samsung phone with hope that they might have improved their quality to beat the Chinese but is still seems that they are not bothered about quality. This is painful and time consuming. Even visiting service centre takes time and it's waste of time and money. The product should at least last for year and half without any trouble. This is not so good.

Samsung Galaxy M30 ! Amazing phone
Purchased this phone on Aug 17th 2019.

Things I liked about this phone
1. The phone came with Android 9 pie out of the box (Yes, Android 9 Pre-installed) (Phone manufactured Aug 2019)
2. The display is simply awesome, amazing super AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution
3.  Battery! 5k mAh battery last 2 days on moderate to heavy use.
4. Phone is not heavy even with 5000 mah battery.
5. Always on Display in enabled on this device (Truly a great feature for me)
6. Dark screen mode is present.
7. Type C port.
8. 15W Fast charger present inside the box.
9. No hybrid slot (dedicated 2 sim and Mirco SD)
10. Triple rear camera.
11. Trust of big brand like Samsung, unlike cheap Chinese phones.
12 . Good RAM management , I worked seamlessly with 10 apps opened.
13. Processor is good for regular daily use, I do not play much games, those who want to play games they may look for better processor phones.

Things I think that could have been better:
1. Camera quality could have been better.
2. Glass back would have made the phone even more premium.
3. No headphone inside the box.

Overall a great purchase!
Just go for it Guys!

Thanks!

TL;DR
Great battery; AMOLED screen; interesting wide angle camera; Blue gradation and Blue light filter; Average processor and Low radiation emission;
If looking for Right amount of everything with some surprises then this is it.

-------------------------

A smartphone is not just about making calls anymore. The way it has integrated with our life has made so many things convenient. Samsung Galaxy M30 is a phone which will give you right amount of everything with a touch of surprises.
- Screen: Infinity U AMOLED Fhd + Display. The Amoled screen is very good. It is not very bright but the color spectrum is detailed and smooth.

- Battery: 5000 Mah... it is a lot. I takes approx 2 hours for it to fully charge but it runs for a very long time. If the power saver mode is on then it is never ending

- Camera: 13+5+5MP Triple rear camera. Camera is average but the 5MP wide angle camera is the surprise. It act as a new tool to play with and makes fun taking photos on certain occasion. The front camera is again average.

- Design: The blue gradation is another surprise. With the world filling with notch phones and standard designs; This gives it a unique touch at this cost

- Rest other: Processor is decent; RAM is okay; Android is 8.1 also; Blue light filter is also very good. Low radiation

Best part is you are getting a high quality triple camera and a massive battery backup in this range by samsung .Better than other famous chinese brands.

Awesome battery life.
Takes 2hrs15mins for full charge from 0%.
And last upto 2 days (50 hrs) for normal usage.

There was doubt before on Exynos processor before purchase of this phone, but found no lag in last two weeks even after heavy multiple apps usage.

Camera provided is genuine 13/16MP. (Tested at night but not tested in bad light)

Dolby Atmos is supported in Earphone/headphone mode.

Body stucture and back material is so slippery. So advice is to buy protective case along with the phone.

SuperAmoled display - this feature made my decision not to buy m40. Because quality of played 1080p videos is vibrant on SAmoled. (As compared to formerly used Vivo V9 and Mi note 6 pro)

And finally the brand - It's Samsung.

Review remains the same after 3 months of use.  But latest launch M30s is definitely better option than this one.

This is what you can expect from the house of Samsung.  Beautifully designed feel like flagship phone , fantastic display , wide angle camera feature just makes the images totally diff
different for normal images , live focus fearure also pretty good in edge detection,  upgradtion to pie has made this phone much more premium in look, battery service is just superb.  I recommend this phone to those who want durability,  stability and flagship feel under 15k,this is daily user 's paradise, on screen display and on story disply feature are fabulous.  One problem I am facing is that phone's  microphone is not very strong..during call  you need to be close to your phone

I have never written a product review but this phenomenal device made me do this. So, in a 14k mobile device, you expect "x" but this phone gives u 3x of everything that u wanted.

Battery- trust me, i was skeptical about the 5k mah until i used it on day one. I am a Very heavy user (100-200 calls/day, Watsapp,office email,fb, Instagram etc till i go to bed) and 100% charge at 9am in mng reaches only 40% after 12-14 hr of usage.

Camera-auto focus, front cam, depth etc. Works good. However, i found some pixelation at zoom. Not sure if m using it incorrectly or its a Device issue.

Display- phenomenal, amazing Samsung is class apart from similar range competitive products. Supeb clarity and u notch makes it look premium.

Gaming- ASPHALT 9 is working smooth. I didn't load many games but benchmark is asphalt so u can decide.

Heating problem- not at charging, 30+ minute on ASPHALT makes u feel the warmth. Not bothering though.

Processor- toggling between screens is smooth, machine response is great.

sadly, no NFC.

Will update review after 1 month of usage.

Battery life was Good as 5000 Mah. Front camera was good 16Mb, back camera was not upto mark. Not good for gaming. Better choose MI note 7 pro with 48 Mp camera features.

Not yet all good choice.

This phone is no doubt a great budget phone.
At Rs 16990, you get quite powerful and premium features. Let me tell you it's pros and cons first -

Pros-
1) Amazing Battery - 5000mah
2) Super Amoled Display
3) The U-cut notch looks very beautiful
4) Triple Rear Camera + Ultra Wide lens
Camera quality is pretty good
5) Fingerprint Reader is very fast
6) The Gradation Blue paint gives a premium feeling when you hold this smartphone
7) If you are a gamer, you can play games on  this phone without worrying about the battery. M3O can run games smoothly without lags.
Cons-
1) If you play high end games like PUBG, the game lags a little bit on HD+High FPS.
2) A little bit slippery when you hold it( A Rs. 100 cover will solve this problem at once.)

Overall : The phone is great. If you are a heavy user who needs the phone throughout the day, the Galaxy M30 is the best choice for you.
However, If you are a Hardcore Gamer and if you care only about High end Graphics, then I recommend you buy the Galaxy A50 or Galaxy M40.

To start with, fingerprint sensor is good, a bit unreachable initially..but you'll get adapted to that....
Camera quality is also good.....could've been more better.....front cam works like magic.....low light photography is better in front cam than rear.....live focus is satisfactory.....no slowMo...wide angle is nice.....
For battery life....you shouldnt face any issues with the heavily powered 5000mAh battery.....with a moderately heavy use you can expect your phone to last a whole day or a bit more than that.....fast charging actually works....
Talking of performance, your phone will feel a bit laggy. But as soon a you update your phone to Pie, it totally changes itself. Andriod PIE update is available and you can update as soon as you purchase the phone. If you are using an old phone and if you buy this one, you'll feel like, "what sorcery is this???how can a phone perform all these things???was i living in stoneAge or something???"
Discussing about other features, Display is awesome, speaker quality is nice..works beautifully with Dolby Atmos which you can use with external speakers and earphones.Rear Cover looks catchy and shiny but better keep it guarded with a screen guard or something as it is very prone to sticky fingerprints and scratches. No earphones provided in box. For more specifications, visit company's website or checkit out on Amazon's specifications tab.

-Face unlock is very fast.
-Mainly look is stunning.....
-Very low radiation

-OneUI update has made single hand operations easier and dark mode looks dope

Cons

I am writing this review 6 months after buying this phone. The specs of this device may look nice, but it does not perform the same after a few months of use. I am constantly facing a serious hanging issue. It seems to be the case with all samsung models (the budget models ofcourse). Even after factory reseting, the problem doesn't stop. It is frustrating.
Also, the delivery from amazon was an issue, as the delivery person marked it as delivered without delivering it. The delivery person issue is subject to the location where you order the item as far as my experience.

I received the mobile at 9 PM on 17-Jul.  I completed my mobile setup by 10 PM and proceeded for the Software update.  After completing the software update they phone stopped responding and could not proceed to next step or even switchoff.  It remains in the same window for several hours. No response to power buttons or calls etc.
I contacted Amazon Tech Support and they have scheduled an appointment for me on Saturday.  So till Saturday, my mobile will remain in this state only (it might switchoff if the power dries)

I'm writing this review  after 3 days usage. This phone is really  awesome and value for money. Three days battery  still at 40% updated  all apps and used this phone these 3 days well. Camera is also good, back camera is not perfect but its average. No need to explain Samsung camera quality.

The main thing is the display,  it is really  perfect. I love this phone.

Cons:

1. Slightly  heating while calling.
2. Pubg works good but not suitable  for regular  games.
3. Back camera set up no 4k recording

Now about camera, triple camera has do good job beautifull picture quality bokeh and portrait mode and another option in their its ultra wide angle that's very cool,u can capture group photos and hills nature with a complete scene I love it but slow motion function is missing this is sad.Fingerprint and face unlock recognation is very quick and smart u can get more opt to do more by fingerprint sensor like sliding photos and tool bar etc. No heating issues at all on heavy gaming like pubg. Fast charging is perfect. And phone having type c USB that also good. Having polycarbonate body and glossy touch body in double shades and over all to say is Value for money.

Bought it as a gift as so far (been little over a month), it has been a fairly good experience. The camera for the price point really works. The phone feel premium to hold. As of now, we don't see any heating issues. I would revise my review later to talk about battery life, as it is too early at this moment. For starters, this phone does deliver.

Face recognition not upto mark specially in low lights.

Touch is unexpectedly bad.

I am using this phone from 17 March 2019 and I was one of the first and foremost customers. I was happy with the phone but I was not happy with the old Android Version and laggy performance but I got used to it. Recently they sent me update for Android 9 and a security patch. After the update, I love the performance of my phone and Samsung has really optimized the software. I use Nova Lancher which works very well my phone. I have seen significant improvement in RAM consumption as well. I bought this phone and had to travel to USA for my work and to my surprise, it works with the AT&amp;T SIM  here which is not pssible with vendors like Xiomi. It saved me from buying a new phone in USA. Thanks to Samsung. The SAR rating is very low and the battery backup is amazing.

Go ahead and buy the phone. Trust the global brand like Samsung.
What else you expect from an INR 15000 phone?

Phone is very good considering its price range for a 6GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory. Camera is decent and its a great buy at this price point. No lagging or freezing. All seems great as of now.

Amazon delivery was fast anf the product arrived decently packed and ahead of delivery schedule.

Overall satisfied.

I've been using this for the past 3 months.

Camera- 3/5
Although it has triple camera but doesn't live upto the hype. Pro mode- waste. why because only controls iso and wb. I mean seriously, a phone within rs.6000 has that feature.
Doesnt have slow motion, no hyperlapse, low light- although the ad states but worthless.
The thing is it needs light. I've  seen this personally, when clicking in daylight it gives awesome pictures.

Performance-4/5
It has 1.6×2 cores and 1.8×6 cores. So on average octa core at 1.8 ghz.

Battery- 5/5.
This is one of its plus point. On average use it lasted for 2 days easily with 8 percent left.

Screen-5/5. Bro its  6.4 inch sAMOLED.
Additional- dedicated sim and SD slot. No ads. I read some review where they mentioned about ad. I don't think they know what they're talking about.
Lowest radiation than other brand phones.
Has Type C so its fast in data transfer too.
There was one stand out feature. Idk whether other phones have it or not but it seems that we can control the brightness of flashlight

I would recommed realme 3 pro. 1k less than this, Has only 4045 mah but its way powerful than this.

If you are looking for a phone which has good enough camera to click pictures and which can last a day and a half, you can buy this phone. The Super AMOLED display in the phone is of superb quality and it is a joy to watch movies on Netflix, Prime video or YouTube. The battery easily lasts for a full day and a half. The charging is also very fast. The phone is good for people who are looking for a smartphone with no gaming. The gaming performance is not great. If you are looking for a budget phone, this is the best phone. If you have slightly higher budget, consider M30s, which has video stabilization and has a bigger battery.

However, there is no gorilla glass, so you need to get screen guard and back cover.

Overall the phone is quite good looking at the price point. Rear camera is not up to the mark, photos comes hazy hazy even at highest resolution. Fingerprint sensor is very good. Face lock is average, it takes 3-4 seconds to unlock. Front camera is good. Sound quality is also average, u will not get crystal clear sound unlike other Samsung phones. Picture and display quality is superb. Battery life is also impressive.

Overall good phone at this price point. But not for the camera loving people. I am using it as official phone, so it is not a problem for me.

Dear online buyers my experience after using Samsung M30 for eight months. Firstly the charger provided with phone become obsolete after two months. Secondly the C type charging port failed to read /detect in PC and laptop after five months. Thirdly after six 5000 amp battery lasts only half a day. Fourthly the finger sensor is less sensitive and requires more pressure; subsequently take more time to detect. Finally the mobile phone got dead in February 2020. Service centre is not accepting and I am running pillar to post no solution. All the important memory and sensitive information is in Samsung confine.
I belived Amazon more than Samsung because they deliver better quality and do the service in highest stranded. You guys have broken my heart, because it’s my sweat and blood, not parents gift. I will not give a negative comment and advice people not to buy. Importantly every story has its melancholy and empathy. Who cares for layman like me? Keep growing and be manifold. God bless!

If ur looking for an mid range phone with mind blowing features then go for it,
(pros):- 5000mh battery ~ amoled display ~ fingerprint / face recognition  ~ 4/6 GB ram if ur going to use this phone for more than a year get 6gb variant :) and the best thing is it's "SAMSUNG"  brand (known for its quality of service) ^_^
(Cons):- camera quality is poor ,slow processor ,image stabilization , single speaker ,not for games , slow fingerprint and face recognition.

Actually I have seen so many  youtube reviews  fingerprint sensor is slow. But its fast. regular usage I didn't  find any delay. I think they  fixed in pie update. Now working  very fast. In Day light camera performance is excellent. Wide angle camera is great. In this price range its the best. But in low light and night time its average. If gcam  worked it would have been better but not. Battery  life is awesome 5000 Mah,  for a regular user like me can get it for 48hrs. On mobile data. For travelers  M30 is the best phone.
Cannot forget to include  Screen  its SuperAMOLED.
Color reproduction is great. Best part is always on display.
ONE-UI is very smooth. Very much easy to use with one hand. You need not to search for one hand mode this, ui itself  useable.

Fingerprint reader is not that fast didn't used face recognition was never interested in it so not gonna talk about it. Battery is awesome lasted for around 2 days with above average use. Camera is not that good i expected a much better experience especially when competitors like redmi note 7 pro provides a real good camera. Selfi cam is more pathetic i don't know if it can be improved by a software updation if it's, then i would like to have it soon very disappointed with selfie cam.
Don't want to talk about gameing experience because i don't play games that much.
Mobile looks good it gives a premium feel oh i forgot about Amoled experience it's really nice display is unbeatable in its segment. Overall i think i'm just okay with the money i spend

This phone is much better option for the people who don't play heavy games in their mobile phones. And This is a great package as you also getting super Amoled Display in this phone and processor of this device is much better than its lower model like M10 and M20. You also get fast charger with this and back of this device is great. You can surely go for this phone if you want a phone in 15k range. But if you will be able to spend 5k more then you can also go for higher models like A50 or Poco F1 etc.

totally bogus and worst built quality, worst material used, samsung cant beat xiaomi in this range coz samsung is a fraud, first it sent a defective product then second one also is very bad, my money is wasted, sim tray is totally worst, i had to forcefully open and insert it. worst plastic used to make the phone. oneplus already have flagship marketshare and xiaomi has mass marketshare, hence samsung should be kicked out

Master blaster.. the screen is the best in this segment. Immersive viewing experience. One can go on and on watching media in this device. And so is the battery. I personally get screen on time of more than 10hrs and still have 30% juice left. Amazon prime HD streaming..YouTube, music, light gaming, photo editing,social media.........the list continues. It's a pure bliss. I have faced no lag, haven't hanged even once in 3 months of usage and RAM management is impressive.
Highly customisable, user friendly, dependable.
The camera is okay,wide angle is fun and color reproduction is pretty good in proper lighting condition..

Everything one can desire is present in M30.

And the device is super light... I am HAPPY!!!

I've bought 4+64gb variant.  It is very good, but not perfect, as I imagined. The camera quality is amazing. Wide angle camera is epic!  But I was expecting manual exposure time in pro mode. No heating problem at all! Charging and battery is awesome! But it's face recognition is not that good. Fingerprint sensor give a very small delay, about half a sec. Screen is amazing with 1080p resolution. It also gives good performance while playing PUBG. I highly recommend this phone to those who are trying to buy a good budget phone.

Awasome phone with awasome specification, but i personaly feels phone's big screen sometime difficult to use.
Detail review and why I gave 3 start reasons are as follow:

Cons first:
1. It started heating after 2 months of use that too I am not using it very roughly. In total 24 hours of day i am using it not more than 2 hours (including everything).
2. Battery start draining fast compare to initial days. During initial days with the same usage it is used to last for two and half days but now it is lasting not more than one and half day.
3. Started hanging up (stopped working). Specially while using camera.
4. Camera quality is not as per expectation. Front cemera is okay but rear cemeras not able to capture things in detail. If you click a photo with rear camera and zoom it, the image will start tearing and blurring. Not very effective for students those who are rely on photos for their studies. Its personal experience.
5. Fingerprint sensor is little bit slow. It takes 1 or 1.5 seconds to respond.

Pros:
1. Good and stylish looking phone.
2. Adaptive display feature is awasome. No need to change the brightness setting while moving from dark to under sun light or vice versa, it adjust automatically.
3. Good torch with adjustable brightness.
4. Good sound clearity.

I wish most of the cons will be eliminated with software update.
And i wish this review will be helpful to the needed one.

Battery life:
 It can easily last you a full day as it has 5000mah battery+ fast charging.

Camera quality:
 I won't say much about camera but it's average...not best and not worst..it gets your work done easily.

UI/laggs:
 I have been using this phone from 3months. so far I have faced no lags.Oneui is well optimized for this phone.

The only down side for me that this phone does not support good lock feature.
But a software upgrade can solve it.

If you r planning to buy this phone ..then you should without hesitation buy it. Its worth it.

After a month of using this phone.
The screen was smashed on the fifth day of me purchasing this phone on it's very first fall! That's a shock. We have used phone which have  been dropped couple of times maximum damage was a dent, scratch or partial screen damage. This phone was completely damaged !!.
Thanks to acko insurance I could replace the screen- 4500rs.
Coming down to the phone- its pretty no doubt. Has a good screen resolution.
But the overall the phone is SUPER SLOW.
I am already thinking of updating to another phone before I drop it and the screen gets damaged !!!!

I got Android Q pre-installed unit.
Camera is good particularly the wide angle. However the white balance screws lowlight photography.

Battery is on average. I'm using accu-battery. Even as the unit is new. The battery health is around 94%. Fast charging is not that impressive. But helpful at times.

Display is good.
Audio quality is just awesome. You can feel surround channels at ear levels. Just perfect. This even can be felt in FM provided if the station reception is good.

Hi guys,
As my opinion don't buy this phone due to lots of reasons.
1. We have paid 15000 but phone haven't secure folder option and today's time this type of service is common.
2. Phone not support hd graphic for gaming like pubg.
3. Phone touch little bit lagging.
4. Camera is good but not up to mark.
5. Not have bixby and other features.
6. Network connectivity too low compared to other phones on same location.
Still have some more points for ignore buying this product.
As my opinion Realme 3 Pro is better option against M30 and also you save upto 1000 INR.

Although it's from samsung I didn't like it's camera. It's not even good.
UI is your choice as you can customize it by third parties application.
In software there were a lot of problems like phone start to ring on incoming call but screen didn't wake-up, you cannot get desired settings in setting you have to search everything, Bluetooth connectivity with smartwatch, phone book search by name.

Camera quality is not upto the mark like other brands have. Battery life they have mentioned first charging but i have tested it's fake not really first charging as usual Samsung provides charging facilities earlier. Look at Oneplus brands they are really awesome. I feel that I've wasted my money, if I could have used same money and buy other home materials my money would have been used for better products. Learnt a lesson 1st time purchased in online in my lifetime. Which is not gonna to happen again.

Amazon delivered product in time. Nice packaging. Fit and finish  of phone  is very good. Waterdrop notch is well placed. AMOLED screen is always better to watch. Superb battery  back up. After three months it is giving  backup of 2 days on routine usage. Day time photo quality is crisp and clear. Low light  photographs  are not upto the mark.
Before  using  this device i was using Samsung galaxy S6 edge for 4 years. After using  high end s6 edge, M30 is value for money for me. I satisfied user ofM30

I bought this mobile on 7th June. After one month display gone. Initially one small DOT came in display after it was spread over the display, When I checked in service center, They told It will not comes under warranty, It is comes under physical damage. But my phone does not have any single physical crack. It is internal damage. I fight with customer service. But they don't accept my query. I have spend 4508 Rs for screen replacement. The mobile not up to the quality mark. Without physical damage how the internal damage will come. Even it is an internal damage company should take the responsibility. How ever my money has gone, with out any damage. Please think twice before you buy this galaxy mobiles.

This phone is not at all durable..  Samsung is using cheap materials to reduce the price.. I dropped the phone while sitting in a chair inside the office and the display was gone.. it was not a huge fall and more over there was a tempered screen and case.. there was no physical damage to the tempered glass.. only a minor scratch on the display.. Samsung service centre charged me 6000 rs for replacing the display.. this is absolutely  pathetic.. there are phones much cheaper and durable for the given price.. don't go for this phone or any other M series phone for that matter..

Samsung Galaxy M30 black 6+128 GB :
It has been 3 months since i am using this device and so far my observations,Pros and cons are :
Pros:
1. Large AmoLED display screen which is crystal clear and creates a beautiful viewing experience.
2. Camera : Its camera might not be the best in it's segment but it is really good except for that it lacks in Image stabilization and low light pics are really grainy.
3.Battery : 5000 mAh battery lives upto it's size and is really very good. 5 stars for battery. Even after 24 hours of moderate to heavy use, i got 25% battery left.
4. Fast charger is really very quick.
5. Always on Display is a great feature.
6. Dolby atmos surround sound when using Headset or when connected to Bluetooth

CONS:
1. Camera: though it is good, it could have been really better.
2. The back of the phone gets very easily scratched so A back cover becomes a compulsion.
3. Could have provided good earphones with the phone.

I have chosen this product over other mobiles in this price range for below reasons :
1. Big battery(5000mah -others have only 4000mah)
2. Triple card slot(believe me this matters though we tend to ignore this point but for those who use double sim ... we would definitely need to use both sims and one memory chip)
3. Super amoled display (again other mobiles simply don't have it)
4. Fast charging + fast charger in-the- box
5. Wide angle camera- useful for big family photos
6. Samsung trust factor

Now after using our fire two full days below are pros and cons I found :

Pros:
---------
1. Battery - Simply awesome. I first charged it yesterday 9.30 AM (100%). Since I did below tasks throughout yesterday and today and it went to 10% today at 6.44 PM ( so 1 day &amp; 9 hrs) :
▪ Audio calls.
▪ video calls.
▪ internet browsing.
▪ listening to songs (headphone and speaker both).
▪ watching movie (Netflix) and YouTube.
▪ setting up phone( usual setting for a new phone - so basically screen was on).
▪ playing games( asphalt 9, dead target, fruit ninja) - all games ran without single stutter.

2. Screen- simply beautiful
Being amoled display it show very deep colours which u won't see in normal fhd lcd/tft displays.

As soon as u will see other mobiles without amoled u will notice the difference.
3. UI is smooth and gestures are nice.
4. Always on display gives our result premium look ( though our drains battery faster).
5. Headphone quality is very nice
6. Call quality is also very nice( the most important feature of any phone but we least bother about it nowadays ).
7. Charging time nice for 5000 mah battery- 2.15 hrs &gt;&gt; 10% to 100%).
8. Camera is decent (not the best int this price range).

Cons:
---------
1. Processor works fine though but i felt slight stutters here n there (but fortunately it worked really nice for three games i played as mentioned above).
2. Camera doesn't perform well in low light conditions) [but works great in day light].

Till now i m seriously enjoying using this phone even people in my office are appreciating our thanks to its stunning display.

This Phone is above this world of android phones.
"FINGERPRINT READER" is as good as the eye power of detecting objects in 1/16th of a second.
And when I say "BATTERY LIFE", you can talk more than 24 hours in single full charge. U can use internet as much as you can by charging once in a day. U can play games, listen to music (YouTube) , video calling and much more u can do. This phone has that much battery life, you will forget when was the last time you charged the phone.
U always don't need to bring your charger with you, if you are on a one day outing.
And it's FAST CHARGING" is also amazing, the phone takes approx 40 minutes to full charge.
Without using internet, I can guess, u can use the phone for minimum 3/4 days.
And one more thing, ULTRA POWER SAVING MODE, after applying this mode u can use the phone for a complete day even in 10% charging and u can use 6-8 Apps in this mode, u can use internet too.
And I thinking I don't need to review it's CAMERAS bcoz I have no words to praise the cameras, Such amazing high quality pictures with amazing filters of different colours , u can record videos in very high resolution.
When we talk about SCREEN, it has very attractive and colourful screen, when u touch u can feel the smoothness. Pixels of the screen are very good, u can use YouTube upto 4K.
And when we talk about RAM and INTERNAL STORAGE u have 4 GB Ram and 64 GB internal storage, you will NEVER face HANG problem.
And it is just a overview, there is much much more in this phone, u will never regret buying this phone.
I strongly recommend this phone to each and everyone. I'm using it since June , from that day I haven't faced any problem.

Bought this phone on amazon for less than 15k and the purchase is not at all disappointing. Love the way samsung has tried to meet upto customers expectations. The triple camera setup at the back ia simply flawless and works amazingly, the depth sensor is excellent for portrait mode photos. Not to mention the battery backup of the phone, the best battery ( 5000 mah) in this range segment and not to worry about the charging time as it comes with a 15 watt fast charger in the box. The AMOLED display on this phone is simply unmatchable, as it supports superior power savings and true black displays, Excellent to watch video, the display always support " Always on feature" which is a premium smart phone feature. The fingerprint at the back is easily reachable and supports gestures as well. The front camera is also simply amazing and supports very good photos. Love the way the phone has been designed and presented. Biggest competitor in this range segment. The dark mode is another add on. Worth buying !!.✌️

Little bit lengthy review bt is very helpful for new buyers.
BEST THING ABOUT PHONE IS ITS GLOSSY LOOK, BIG DISPLAY ,BETTER PERFORMANCE AND MANY FEATURES PROVIDED.
THE PHONE COMES WITH 4/64 GB SPACE BUT U ONLY GET 49 GB STORAGE. LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED BY THE CAMERA AND THE BATTERY.
BATTERY LIFE NOT AS EXPECTED(5000 mah ) BUT IT WORKED AS NORMAL 3500 mah BATTERY CHARGING SPEED IS SUPER COOL VERY FAST CHARGING I EXPERIENCED 15 TO 90  PERCENT IN JUST 40 MIN. THATS A GR8 SPEED COMPARED TO OTHER SMARTPHONES. BATTERY IS NOT AS MUCH LONG LASTING AS MENTIONED IT WORKS FOR ABOUT 5-6 HOURS ON HEAVY CONTINUOUS USE which is disappointing with 5000mah battery.
CAMERA GOOD, NOT AS U WILL EXPECT WITH 13+5+5 MP primary and 16 MP secondary camera but much good with respect to other SMARTPHONES.
REST THING GR8 I LIKED THIS PHONE IN 13999RS with Samsung's quality . VALUE FOR MONEY😊😊....

First of all the phone. The phone itself looks and feels a bit luxury while using. The screen is a beast of I would say. And mostly the buyers from this segment search for a lot of phones with the best features and then come to a certain conclusion. But I  my regards this phone is a beast in this price segment. The fingerprint reader is as swift as it could be. The camera is a beast and if I am reviewing so, it means a lot for me as I am a professional fashion and streets photographer and have been practicing photography for almost 6 years now. I have seen a lot of phones these days but the camera lives up to all expectations and with the addition of the wide angle feature and camera too, it makes this phone a complete package.
About battery, so battery is 5000 mah one. I literally charged my phone the day it came and then used it for a couple of days and by using I mean YouTube, spotify, at least 3 hours of pubg and 4g turned on 24/7. This phone literally packs up the best an android user could experience at a price segment of a mere 14k.
Also did I mention that it's a Super Amoled display so all your colors are going to punch in hot. The phone's brightness and vibrance is also good enough to give you a luxury feel while watching videos, movies and while playing games.
In my opinion, Samsung Galaxy M30 is the best phone I have used till now in the segment.
Cheers to Samsung for coming back as a beast in the smartphone game.

Well, I am extremely grateful to Samsung for launching a beast in this budget segment!
I'll start off my review by mentioning every minute details possible.

Looks = 4.7/5: It doesn't any look like a 15k phone, When you hold it in your hand you can actually feel it's aristocraticness, a couple of people have asked me which device is that in my hand considering its attractive design. Although, The battery life is 5000 mah the phone doesn't seem any bulky, hats off to Samsung for its sturdiness.

Camera Front-facing = 4.1/5: Not that of a great front facing camera but if you're an average selfie taker you won't be at least disappointed.
Camera Rear = 4.4/5: It has a decent rear camera and does the magic with its 3 lenses at the back, One the breathtaking feature of the rear camera which makes the other mid-range phones feel down is it's Ultra-wide lens which not only shows you a vide and vivid picture but showcases you every possible detail without a blur, If you are a female user, bet, you'll fall for scene optimiser and it's vibrant face beauty feature which comes out of the box.

Battery life &amp; charging speed = 5/5: I'm totally speechless seeing the battery performance, it's simply outstanding. My family had Redmi Note 6, 7 Pro and Asus Zenfone max 2, When they are out of their juice fighting out for who'll take the wall adapter close to the bed, I am happily streaming web series on Netflix :D

The SOT that I get is around 11 hours on an average usage, surfing web, watching videos and few hours of Pubg. Charging time from 0 to 100 is around 1 hour and 40 minutes which is pretty decent too.

Display = 4.7/5: The display that you get for this price is simply unbelievable, A bright super high definition AMOLED display is comparatively far better than the retina display on my Ipad (No lies) it comes along with adaptive brightness feature and the sunlight exposure on the screen is not bad either.

Ram management = 4.6/5: One of the scariest thing that I got to hear through some reviews was this phone lags in terms of Pubg and video rendering, Being a video editor, I haven't faced any sort of UI lag or low graphics issues. Pugs run buttery smooth for 1-2 hours, The device hardly gets any heat and switching between the apps is quite easy and smooth you can even get an app open from where you left off even hours or days later.

Fingerprint scanner = 4.3/5: It's far most not the best that I have used but in day to day life you aren't running short of those microseconds where those Chinese brands are doing better, fair point, Right?

Overall = 4.5/5: You do get delivered more than what you expect from a 15k device that too from a reputed brand like Samsung who's software management with the latest Android Pie is one of the best + The after-sales support which is the best in India. I'm a fan of this device and trust me you'll end up being one too!
