Highly disappointed with the after sale service
-----
I have ordered this product on 5th May 2020 and received it on 12th May 2020. The USB cable of the charger is faulty and the cap of the tip is loose. I almost ended up getting an electric shock while removing it from charging. Called the customer care and the Customer Care associate Prem was getting bothered by our calls as we were seeking exchange of the USB cable. We didn't get any satisfactory solution and hence writing this review. Highly disappointed with Amazons customer care department. Though been a regular customer, didnt expect this sort of after sales service

Review after 3 Day..

1. Battery :- 5/5
Two day battery standby for normal easy

2.Display:- 4.99/5
Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display

3.Design:3/5
It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. No
glass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..  In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers

4. Camera: 3/5

Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low..  many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..

5. OS&amp;UI:- 5/5

Android 10 with One UI

6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5
 Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast

7.Processor and performance 3.5/5

Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers  .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer..  No lag ang hang till now..  but processor is outdated..

8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone

9. Accessories : 2/5

No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard..  So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..

Verdict: For this price  Its the best choice for a non gamer  ...
-----
Worth it (Non gamer review)
-----
Value for money.
I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.
I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.
But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.
As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.
-----
A rebadged m30s
-----
Looks like just to clear the unsold stock of m30s they gave it a new name and advertised it as a totally new phone. Everything is similar to m30s, except the price (and selfie camera). Good thing is that they kept the price low.

Just got it delivered today. So far so good, many users compalined about battery, charging speed, display issues on m30s. Hope they got it resolved in m21.
-----
Battery life is not upto mark
-----
I am writing my review after using it for 6 days
.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.
Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

Samsung galaxy m21 very good phone in this price... I am bought rs 12699.. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòâ

Worst product at 15000 Rs. Price
-----
Very poor performance. Hangs aloft. Even I don't use any gaming app. In browsing only, this phone lacks. Inspite of having 6 GB RAM. This product serves zero rating. Please don't buy  this. Wastage of money. No refund policy for this device.
-----
Watt monster??
-----
A nice looking phone.
Light weight because of the plastic body. Performance is pretty good.
But it doesn't feel like a 6000 mAh battery. Probably a little shy of that figure. It Drains relatively quickly than what is expected of a 6000 mAh capacity.
But overall a product worth it's price. Probably not good for high performance gaming.
But expect it to be durable with a low-medium usage.

Even realme performs better.....few issues which concerned me after use were
1. When recording slow motion videos...there is
  always flicker on screen.
2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work
3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi
4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming
5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone
6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue....

Suggestions for people who have bought this phone.....
Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early...

Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone.....
If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....

I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..

Frequently restarts
-----
The phone(M21 Raven Black) is not working properly since its purchase. After the first installation, it is on frequently on and off mode and even restarts after more than 30 minutes. Moreover 4-5 times it takes more than 2 hours for starting.
I also register a complaint to Amazon regarding this. I don't need such a disgusting phone any more. it wastes my 3 days. So, I request to Amazon kindly refund my money, I don't need replacement.

I would still buy it again.

I like the camera quality, screen sensitivity,  and browsing experience. The speed is excellent.
I don't like it's sound. The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours.

Amazing phone!
-----
The phone is simply amazing. The Raven Black model looks gorgeous. Very sturdy. The camera quality is excellent. The UI is user friendly. This phone is similar to the Samsung range of phones, so it is hard to decide the model that's best for its price. According to my analysis, M21 is a good by at 12699/-.

Super budget phone

Nice rear camera and nice selfie camera but front camera struggles at night , sound is superb, display is awesome, battery ok, fingerprint reader superfast, I would suggest 6GB variant.

Heating issue

Heating problem. In simple browising only phone gets heated up in upper side. When asking for replacement amazon customer care they are fooling us. Very pathetic condition.

Not reliable.

Don't like this product. It looks, it's already used by someone else. Apps are not downloading. It shows 6 apps
are downloading. I'm confused.
-----
Nice phone üëç
-----
Display good, battery  performance  after one  week  of use has improved,camera is good,hope Samsung  provides  regular  updates..
-----
Really a monster of a phone at this cost
-----
At this cost, the phone looks premium. For folks who like a premium looking phone not the fancy looking phone, this is the best at this price segment. all other products at this price bracket consist of fancy and decorated back which may not be the cup of tea for a section of people for whom simple and plain is the premium. Monster battery, One of the best display at this price segment, great finger print sensor, decent camera etc.. If you are a non gamer, go for it...

Only problem i faced is delay in delivery (almost 10 days).
-----
Best budget phone.... Strongly recommended
-----
The best to choose among the available choices in this range.  I am using it since one week and I am fully impressed with all the features. The camera quality and battery life are excellent. Fingerprint reader is very fast.  Elegant design and wonderful display. The user interface is also very good.  Only difficulties I faced was to find app lock and split screen. But these purposes were fulfilled by external apps from the play store.

I strongly recommend purchasing this phone. The best value for money product. I am full satisfied with the purchase üòä
-----
think.it before buy
-----
Amazing phone But m not satisfied with camera quality, its 48MP? I used samsung galaxy S8 its only 12MP single camera which is good for m21 tripple camera.
One more thing is back panel is plastic which is not good looking inthis range ..Its not feel premium with this budget....

Super Slow Camera, Big Battery &amp; Worst Backup, Huge Charging Time,  Poor Network Antenna
-----
I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21.
The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED display
The issues I faced are
1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera
2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside
3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).
4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.
Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k
-----
This mobile phone is not satisfactory  with lot of issues as mentioned
-----
After 5 hrs continuously  charging gallery level reach 55 %,during call sound quality not clear,a lot of heating problem,camera quality not good,network issue,slow processing
-----
Yeah...it's best in this budget...
-----
There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone.

1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever.

2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone.

Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give.

Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm.
Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge.

Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone.

For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.

WhattaPhone
-----
Great phone. There is no overheating like others say. For the price you getting a quality phone with massive battery life.
Here are the pros:-
Good quality
Excellent display
Excellent battery
Best camera

Here are the cons:-
Speaker quality is not good. It's loud but distorted at high volume with no bass at all

Headphone quality is ok. Not the best. I prefer wireless because of Dolby Atmos

Charging speed is ok, not fast nor slow. It took 2hrs to fully charge. It's fast for 6000mah

Camera app need a redesign

Aside all this.. it is the best phone under 15k.

Go for it.

Value for money Smartphone...
-----
I got this phone on 15th of May.I am writing this review  after 5 days of usage...
1.Battery backup is not very good. It's good but not like 6000mah at all.Also charging is really slow.
2.It's SAmoled screen is best in this price range.
3. Processor is not very powerful,I have noticed some occasional lags.
4.Heating issue detected in front camera areas
It's not like overheat or something but it is hot.
5.Os is good but there is no network speed meter function present natively.
6.FB app is keep refreshing it's feed when I minimize and open the app again after some time.
7.Sometimes app crashes without any reason.
8.The phone is heavy not too heavy but you can easily notice it after some day's of usage.
9.At 12699 price I don't think there is any other phone is as good as this is,atleast for now.
10.It doesn't have Good lock and native screen recorder present in OS neither you can sideload them.This is unfair I think.

Very good phone. But charger is not so good.

Phone is very good. But charger is not up to the mark. It takes 2.5 hours toh charge from 1%  to 100%. So plz change this charger. Although performance wise ph is superb. In 15000 rs range . Ultimate ph

Cons
Back panel build quality

Extraordinary and Pantagruelian in this price range
-----
Amazon deserves the innumerable accolades for delivering this phone in this maze of lockdown.  This is ineffable service from Amazon. This is great and uncomparable phone. THANK YOU SAMSUNG..outstanding performance and extraordinary battery life..
-----
Mind Blowing!!!
-----
This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Good:

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
- Received next day by 11 AM !

Not So Good:

- Not that thin, but ok.
- Doesn't have Samsung Dex
- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.
- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)
- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.

Feedback

- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.
- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.

Go for it without any doubt.

Good Specs for a reasonable price.
-----
The seems ok. Plastic built phone. Camera is ok. Charger and cable seems poor in quality. the packaging was so poor. thank god that the product reached home safely. only a plastic cover as available. company not including any earphone, back cover or screen guard, nothingis present. its my first with with the phone.
-----
Samsung phones have signal strength issues
-----
I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card.

 I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.

Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.

M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacks

M21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11

This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50s

Battery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.

Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.

Pros:
Super amoled screen
6000 MaH battery

Cons:
Signal strength is very poor.
(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)

Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc

Samsung brand is no 1

Samsung is globally no1 seller of the smartphone plz by this phone as super amoled display and 6000 mah in this price range

Value for  money

I am posting this review upon using this device for 5 days.
-Camera is ok, I would like to mention "Megapixels " doesn't work if you really don't have the quality camera, but for the money what you pay it's okay to bare üòú
-Display is pretty decent
-Battery is a monster yet it takes time to fully charge 3hrs needed from 20% to 100%, but you won't have to search for a charger for whole day(I am not a gamer hence don't know how it will work with gamers )
If you are really looking for a budget friendly phone go for it.

Good but not Great

Camera is pathetic. Heating issue. Battery performance is not good and drain out fast.

Greatt Device for Entertainmet like music and Videos....camera and image processing can be improved
-----
Steal the deal ..‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èI m a regular user i dont do gaming purchased this one to watch series and other content bcz of its display, so the Device is really good in this budget....display is awesome...no lagging issues or any other heating problems in day to day tasks or while charging.....takes around 2 hours to get charge fully from 20% only con is...camera and image processing could be more improved bcz it gives a whitish shade to skin tone and overall image lookes a bit whitish...so saturation need to be improved....otherwise its a great great device at this budgetüòä

Amazing quality for professional use in this range

Awesome product at amazing price point
-----
Has been using for 11 days.....short time period but have sufficient knowledge.....

Has been using Redmi phones for long but decided to move away from Chinese products so turned toward Samsung....

Had a limited budget of 15k......and got this phone for 12699, well within budget but without compromising on
features. In fact got more features that expected.

Pros
1. Amazing display
2. Great Battery power - Very few phones have such large batteries of 6000 mah.
3. Good performance owing to good processor and 4 GM RAM.
4.  64 GM internal memory good enough for day to day use.
5. Great camera - very good pics in low light as well. Video quality is also good - 4K.
6. Separate slot for memory card in addition to dual sim slots.
7. All required security options including face recognition.

Cons
1.May be a bit heavy than my previous phone but got used to it after 4-5 days of usage.

Long term reliability however needs to be tested as this is a new phone, manufactured in March 2020. As
of now performing smoothly.

Overall very good phone with features of a costly phones at such a low price point.

-----
Good phone but ethics of Samsung has gone down
-----
Good product by Samsung
But I think samsung is also going the way of other cheap China mobiles by selling our data. Maybe to tackle the competition?

First time when I switched on and starting updates I found other party apps like like videos ,Facebook and other unnecessary  apps started to get installed without my permission.
But later these things have to be removed  settings tweaked to tackle the problem and it was really tough.
Wasn't expecting this from samsung.(may be they thought that this is low end phone so why to worry?)

-----
Absolutely fantastic product! Loved it. The battery life is amazing and it charges 0-100% within 2 hours. Through continuous use the battery last full day which is great. I would say that camera is good but it didn't meet my expectations but I am not a camera person. Value is great. You can't find better product than this at this price. It has AR, AR Emoji, Night Mode, Super SloMo @240FPS.

I ordered mobile for my brother. Mobile is looking very in hand feeling. Its have a biggest battery life. The super amoled display. Camera quality is super, so many features there for camera.

-----
Value for money
-----
Very standard product of samsung. Fingerprint scanner quality is much better than other, camera is good, allover that is value for money in this prize. And also as of being an Indian I don't want to give a single penny to Chinese Companies it is good for me.
-----
Defective piece received
-----
Defective piece received. Mobile do not  switch on  why  5 hours charging but not  turn on. Please replace the mobile
-----
Awful service and worst phone.
-----
Pathetic phone. It is overheating and I am not able to use it. Worst customer service from Amazon guys as they are saying blanco app shows heating as normal in diagnosing. Awful service and worst phone.
-----
Problem of Lag or hang
-----
Battery is good ....camera  is not that much good when its comparing with Redmi phones  .. processor is good and speed ...but within 3 days my phone's system is stuck sometimes  ...even when i didn't use it for long time...
  And I didn't  get any hard copy invoice  with delivery  ... I get only soft copy
-----
It actuay eradicating china phone.#monster
-----
In the budget price it actually affordable.In today's competitive era samsung really make no hanging issue phone as I am a samsung lover.Samsung is not in previous samsung.Its time to burning in the market.As I study all phone in Covid-19 pandemic situation , samsung is best in the long term basis if you a game lover then go for high Ram and High processor.Otherwise  it is best truely monster.All are working fine and smooth.Thank you all readers....I have purchased in 21 May 2020.

M21 very poor performance
-----
Received Samsung M 21 yesterday..highly disappointed  about slow charging and poor quality of camera..did not expect this from Samsung.I suggest not to buy this mobile.
-----
Bigyan reviews
-----
Processor had to be better, Dolby atmos had to work without  earphone, but an outstanding  phone....love  it..before  packing  the  product  should be  free  from  corona
-----
Overall Nice package, but has heating.
-----
The phone has over heating, while charging/using portable hotspot and mobile data.
Also charging takes 3 hours, from 0 to 100 percent.
The gpu is not upto the mark.
The battery is  not upto the mark considering 6000Mah.
Display and camera are good in this segment.
-----
Good quality product specially Battery is too goo
-----
I have been struggling to find some good performance + battery backup product and M21 has done this. Overall this is v good mobile in terms  of performance + Battery .  I will not say anything about camera because this is not my requirement but camera is also good
-----
Samsung Galaxy M21 blue
-----
Superb thanks to Samsung üëçüëç

Just one word Amazing
-----
Super value for money!
-----
The phone is really good for the price. The camera is good, the fingerprint sensor is a lot better (faster and more accurate) than my old Galaxy S8 and the display is really superb!

Two things I feel aren‚Äôt that well:
1. Auto-brightness sensor is not well calibrated
2. Battery capacity is good but the system is not well optimised which leads to higher battery drain
-----
Paisa Wasool Mobile M21
-----
Camera pixels are of high resolution the pic. is clear and doesn't differ even after zooming. Battery is monster but still phone is consuming more power that battery lasts for 1 day perfectly while using roughly which should be more.I am enjoying this phone hence it's perfect value of money Thank you Samsung for giving amoled screen at affordable price
-----
Not as per company reputation....
-----
Heating problem is a measure problem.
Not working properly üòí
-----
Excellent Budget King for Samsung lovers
-----
This I my review after 1 month
Pros
1. Super Amoled Display ( Excellent )
2. Huge Battery 6000 mah Backup up to 2 days (awesome)
3.Camera Improved when compared to previous M series ( Nice)
4.One U1
5.SOC Nice performance when compared to exynos 7906
Corns
1. Fast charging Better if Samsung will give 20 or 30 w fast charger
-----
Received Defective phone
-----
I received a samsung galaxy M 21 which is defective, as it does not start, or it does not even charge. Please help me initiate a return for the same

-----
Jus don't fall for low price.
-----
Face lock is not working properly, batter life is good but takes 4-5 hours for full charge,
Low light images are of poor quality and most disappointing thing is that it doesn't have applock and if you download S secure from galaxy store than it won't even notify for new messages if you lock that application with S secure.
-----
Great Battery Life
-----
Pros-
Awesome product.
Value for money.
Great battery life.
Awesome screen quality.

Cons-
Heats up quickly.
Back cover gets scratches so order back cover as well while purchasing.
You will get some pre-installed apps like Netflix, Outlook which cannot be uninstalled

Also phone is taking some time while taking pics . Main thing is camera quality is poor.

Watta Budget Monster
-----
After using this gadget for 1 month, I am writing this review.
So, all you guys know the main features of this Smartphone is it's Battery and it's Super AMOLED Screen also the brand value  which you are getting in this Budget Smartphone can not be ignored!
Keeping aside the brand value, you'll get exynos 9611 which is enough for you to do great things lag free. Rear Camera works brilliantly and front camera is decent. Also, you can play PUBG Lag free in (HD Ultra) settings for 1-2 hours. After that it starts heating (not a lot). But remember my advise, this phone is not for gamers, it is dor those who are in a need of feature packed budget smartphone from a reliable and trustworthy brand "SAMSUNG".

Very happy to purchase it!
Worth Buying in this price range....

Not a good phone. I can't use bluetooth headphones and mobile hotspot together, there is some voice problem. Battery life is worse also there is no fast charging. Fingerprint &amp; face unlock not so fast. You can have many other options in this price range.

This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Good:

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
- Received next day by 11 AM !

Not So Good:

- Not that thin, but ok.
- Doesn't have Samsung Dex
- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.
- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)
- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.

Feedback

- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.
- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.

Go for it without any doubt.

Faulty product
-----
Dear Amazon &amp; samsung you have broke my trust, Lot of noise in images while capturing photos in low light.
Rear Camera getting blur in low light.
-----
False ads, poor camera quality, inefficient battery management
-----
Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.
Cons:
1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.

2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.

3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day "return" policy to 10 day "replacement" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.

Pros:
1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.

2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.

3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

Inferior quality and built
-----
I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.

64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.

Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.

Face unlock very slow.

Heat issue which charging and heavy usage

Full charge takes more than 3 hrs

Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone
go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality
-----
Not good at alll
-----
Software is no working. No sounds in media, cant attend calls, every 5 mints phone gone to switched off and even though no retraining option.
-----
Samsung it's not fair .
-----
Phone camera is not good , samsung says it's 64 mega pixel but its photos like 8 megapixels .photo detailing are not good  . Also processor is not Upton the mark it's some time slow and hang in multi function use . While using keyboard , keyboard hide automatically for 1 second . My mobile variant is 6 GB 128 GB. Don't waste your time and money .

Serious Issue
-----
The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.

Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.

However my only concern is "dust" and how it came there if its brand new.
So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.

Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

Bad Product by Samsung
-----
Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.
-----
A fab phone at this price!
-----
1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play &amp; Lenovo K8 Note.
2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.
3. PROS.
(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek &amp; stylish to look at.
(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.
(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.
(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.
(e) With quad camera &amp; a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.
(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.
(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.
4. CONS.
(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.
(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.
5. I'm satisfied with the phone &amp; the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  &amp; brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. üëç

Faulty selfie camera, video playback lagging no money back
-----
I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product. Amazon has agreed post diagnosis saying its a faulty piece  but does not give refund
-----
My Real Review - M31 is Average
-----
Hi
I am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.
Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.

1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.
2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.
3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.
4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.
5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.
6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.
I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.

Thanks.
-----
QUALITY IS NOT SATISFIED
-----
Not satisfied with the quality
Display quality is no adequate
Body is made of plastic like material
I was using MI like 6 plus pro then 7 plus pro
For a change I have purchased this product, the quality is not up to the mark when comparing to my old redmi note series
I have requested for refund but as Amazon policy they refused for refund
Not value for money
-----
Little overpriced. Not very ergonomic. Bad sound, defective piece.
-----
Cons:
Button position (power&amp; volume) too high
Fingerprint reader too high
Heats up a lot.
Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.
A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.
A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours &amp; 28 minutes
Speaker volume low.
The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.

Pros:
Feels lightweight
Nice display.
The camera is decent.

Update 1:
Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.

Update 2:
Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.

Update 3:
Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit.

M31 was worst phone with camera quality.. front is 8 MP and back 16 MP
-----
I purchased this phone by seeing 64 MP for camera usage but M31 was the worst phone with camera quality.. Front camera is 8 and back camera was 16 MP not more that that.. there is no return option only replacement(Good game was playing by samsung &amp;Amazon) please dont buy this mobile and dont waste your money... Heating problem while charging.. etc  i am really  very frustrated with this phone quality.. i lost my money by buying this phone..üòîüòîüò™

Waste mobile waste online seller
-----
One of worst mobile and one of the worst brand. Better to purchase any other brand except Samsung.
1. Heating issue
2. Second sim works on 3g.
3. Even its 6Gb ram works like 2gb ram phone.

When I called amazon customer care they said I have to go to service center for this and they are telling to check through app.

Its a f***ing phone please please please don't waste your money.

And this is my last ever purchase from amazon.
-----
not up to mark, waste of money
-----
1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around.
2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point.
3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network.
 wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone.
bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance.

Performance issue
-----
I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day.  Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting  sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes.
 I expect this might be  software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.
Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me.
-----
I PURCHASE 6GB 128GB
-----
UNTILL I AM USING REDMI NOTE 7 PRO

-----
This is a duffer phone &amp; not a smartphone
-----
I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!
I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!
I so miss my POCO

First the pros
1. The brand name - if you think it is one!
2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant
3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos
4. Build - seems decent

Cons:
1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying
2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today
3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable üò≠. What kinda innovation is this
4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app tooüò¨. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device
5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device
6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic
7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emailsüò≠. Believe me, I have tried all settings
8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps üòÇü§£. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking
9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.

The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates me

Anyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me now

What a waste of Money this has been
-----
Not Worth to buy...Extremely bad phone
-----
Lot of heating issues, Picture quality is dam bad, Battery not at all look like 6000 MAH, it is hardly 3000 MAH. Taking 4 hrs to full charge and draining like any thing. No match to the technology from Chinese Products like OPPO,LENOVO and Realme. Way behind compared to chinese products. Humble request to all, not to buy this product...
-----
Good but not perfect...
-----
Display quality is good. But one thing which I don't like about the camera is that we can't use flash light when we take shots with 64 MP lens. Low light photographs are also not upto the mark. Rest everything is fine.
-----
front cemera
-----
use front cem iam not happy
-----
Don't buy
-----
Cons:
1. RAM. Claims to be 6GB, whereas my 2year old phone with 4GB RAM has much smoother display
2. Battery Charging. Claims 15W fast charging. Takes more than 2 hours to charge the phone.

Pros:
1. Good cameras
2. Perfect screen size

I bought it as a great deal from Samsung, but it is a BIG dissappointment. And they say it cannot be returned. Total waste of money for me. Redmi Note pro 8 is much better than this at same price.
-----
It is a real Monster
-----
Received it on time within 24 hours thumps up to amazon. Now Product. Done all the settings. I am using samsung after a long gap of 8-10 years. After Samsung Grand I had stopped using. So setting done now data transfer Samsung's smart switch option is fantastic. Everything I wanted to transfer got it. No problem at all .Now SIM transferred. Done OK it is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card. Effortless working.
Now Camera. It has got lot of options. All I have not yet tried but for sure I have checked the quality of the photograph and the night mode is superb. What else you want to know rest of the things are written in detail and is true. Working very fine. Proud to won it. Nice Product. Samsung should keep competing iPhone

Genuine review after usage
-----
Over am not that super satisfied..
Pros
# Good LiveFocus camera, Shallow DoF is excellent
# sAmoled Display is great
# Good features

Cons
# Slow-motion video sucks goes dark
# Macro lens has lot of distortion
# Charging sucks needs 2.5hrs to get full charge, 6000mah is good but discharges 1.5day for normal usage.
# Slight heat while charging..
# 9 out of 10 times doesn't recognise your face during low light, figer print reader is also slippary
# Poor mobile &amp; Wifi Signal scanning
# Phone is slippary in hand use protective case always.

Over all I didn't get the feel I expected for this price range..
-----
Ok product for the price range
-----
I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.

Pros:
1. Display: Trust me it‚Äôs amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.
2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.
3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.

Cons:
1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.
2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.
3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.
4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn‚Äôt work even after adding alternate looks.

Verdict: You can buy this if you don‚Äôt like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.

Best Budget phone for Avg Users
-----
It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display &amp; mammoth battery.
Pros :
1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )
2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.
3. SAR rating - lowest one
4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )

Cons :
1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print &amp; dust magnet )
2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great
3. Not so great processor

Who can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming &amp; not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery &amp; Samsung branding.
-----
Heat and charging and camera issue on M31
-----
Worst mobile was I got , Samsung m31 taking more time for charging 100% , it's almost 4 hours for charging , and after that 20 hours battery I'll train 0% its waste of time compare to other fast charging mobile , and camera worst
-----
Impressive phone to keep all key specs at an economical priceü§©
-----
Delivery was fast, packing was good, phone started quite unusual that applications were not even downloading on wifi, later after a couple of restarts it's good now. So thumps up , happy so far .
-----
Got a dead phone.
-----
i am a Big fan of Samsung products, but today i got a dead phone, first i thought it don't have charging so try to charge the phone but no response,i am really really disappointed today. but thanks to amazon the responded quickly and ordered a replacement. but now i am worried about phone performance now. how i am going to handle if future same problem arises. before buy think again.
-----
Over heat Processor is very basic processor
-----
What is this samsung,
i didn't expect from you.
plastic body is ok we can use cover.
Corning gorella glass 3 is ok we can use tempered protection.
Even 3 hr charging time is ok we can charge during night.
But Overheating how can we deal with them !
this price range other companies providing super fast , cool processor like snapdragon 730G.
&amp; What you do fooling customers.

About phone camera and product
-----
First time met very bad experience from Samsung phone, camera quality is very poor. Front facing camera not good at all. Not comfortable with 6000mahbattery life.
Amazon.india  just destroyed their Goodwill by selling this product.
I purchased this phone for my friend. And now he is angry on me....
Dear customer please avoid to buy this product.
-----
Good phone with slightly disappointing issues.
-----
Cons:
1. No notifications light.
2. Large icons.
3. No preinstalled app lock. You can install s secure to achieve that but lock symbols will be there on each locked app.
4. Ringtone volume not so loud.
5. No back cover provided.
6. Camera is not that great as expected with 64mp.

Pros:
1. Screen quality
2. Ram management
3. Smooth performance
4. Battery performance. After 12 hrs of usage, still having 60 % remaining battery (5 hours screen on time).
5. Looks are pretty good.
6. Samsung brand.
-----
Don't buy seriously
-----
Worst experience ever, camera quality not better 5out of 2, battery down very fast, max 3 hours taken charging 100% ,sometime WhatsApp hangups.108 gp free storage but mobile heating high, fingerprints only 3 finger available,  not better fingerprints,  I am the first buyer before launching. Over all don't buy this m 31. No extra protection, no additional option,  very simple mobile,not worthiness of money,

Great üì±üî•‚ù§Ô∏è
-----
Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ‚Çπ59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.
------------------------------------------------------
Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.
Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.
-----
Worst mobile..Don't buy..Go for  redmi.
-----
Very bad mobile. Heating and hanging problem. Amazon not refunding even having mobile problem. Don't buy this mobile. Go for Redmi mobile. Camera  quality is  worst. Many thing's not  supported. Anyone want to take this mobile please let me know. Reduce some amount. Buy before 7 days. Only  battery is good other is worst. Samsung  must quit in making mobile.

Review after a week of usage
-----
I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and cons
Pros:
1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.
2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)
3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAM
Cons:
1. Front Camera is not as good as expected
2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ‚≠êÔ∏è)
3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex
-----
Net work speed very slow also charging not like fast charging
-----
Very poor performance.. camera is ok not bad . But very slow net speed .. opening app time is relatively fast but after internet is very slow .... my old mobile Samsung on max is much faster performance for loading web page than Samsung m31 .. this phone taking much more time to open any web site ... remaining everything is ok ..
Fast changing is not far like they said .. 30 mins charging it charging 20% but my old Samsung is 30% charged at same time . I have found this two major drawback.
-----
Worst Mobile... Don't waste money
-----
First... I would like to express my experience of this mobile is tooooooo worst.... It's never performed like 6GB Ram Mobile.... It's working like 512kb ram ram mobile. And another great backdrop is it's bluetooth... It's connectivity does not meets at atleast basic phone... And another thing is it's speaker...This one also very poor.... Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst...
I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms.
Finally, my dear all who want to buy this product i strongly recommend that don't buy this mobile and don't waste your money...
-----
DONT PURCHASE this M31.
-----
Apart from battrey and screen nothing is good. Front facing camera as per specs is of 32mp. But when u go for high resolution it show 21MP... TOTALLY CRAP. My samsung j7's 8mp is FAR MORE BETTER THAN this one in terms of front camera. FRAUD BY SAMSUNG.
Finger prnt reader is not able to detect most of the times.
-----
Good phone in this price
-----
The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screen
If you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colors
I am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few days
Camera pictures are good
Lots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually
-----
Camara quality is too bad
-----
Camara is too bad. Sound clarity is not at all good ... though it looks like a premium phone ,but when you started using it makes you feel that you bought a cheap quality product. Gets frequently stuck and restarts for no reason.
-----
BAD CAMARA, VERY SLOW CHARGING, NOT IMPRESSIVE  DESIGN. NOT RECOMMENDED.
-----
I was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this.

Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara.

During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendly

The most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......

Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.

Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme.. I trusted Samsung  but eventually  it didn't  fulfilled  my expectations.
-----
Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it
-----
Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.
After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.
Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons üòú). Think before buying this phone.

For Battery &amp; Performance - 5 STAR , for UI - 3 STAR
-----
hi,
I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm.
On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good.

Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall.

However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.

Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.
1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc
2. LED flash for incoming calls
3. Reminders &amp; Goals missing in Calendar
4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc
5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting. Seems like it needs high lighting
-----
Best spec mobile with lowest SAR value under 15k.
-----
Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels).
Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones.
Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardware

Finally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands.
Infact my first samsung phone.
While configuration, received security patch and UI updates
From user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands.
Since the frameless case in yet to be delivered, using it very carefully
Super happy user since 3days. No complaints or regret on buying the phone.
-----
Amazing. Bang for Buck. 5/5.
-----
A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.
-----
Poor quality according to battery and camera....
-----
Bad ever phone I have buy now going to return it back .... in YouTube channels  10hrs continue battery but in reality poor battery performance once you play a game it reduce up to 30percent battery every bad performance.... camera quality that shown by youtubers in reality 64MP doesn't  evn give its 40percent....poor fake quality  display of Samsung and I was always right about it ....
-----
Disappointing 64MP Camera!!!!
-----
Camera is not as expected. Its garunteed not 64MP the way it takes pictures. Ofcourse the colors in the pictures are awesome however, if we try to zoom even slightly it doesnt show clearly. Night mode is also not as expected it gives blurr images. I am disappointed with the camera as camera was the sole reason I took this phone. Front camera is as usual with full of beauty effects which I hate. Otherwise, speaking about its other features such as battery, looks and feel, Display, etc it is pretty well with this price. Although the plastic feels kinda cheap but its ok.
-----
Fraud by samsung
-----
1.Camera - 3.8/5
2.Performance - 3.0/5
3.Battery backup - 2.7/5
(Battery doesnot prove itself as 6000mah)
Charge time is quiq agreed.But,drains fast.Feels like the capacity is 4000mah.
My reivew im submitting after a week of observed usage.
My major point on selecting this mobile was battery.........They assured 6000mah but the fact is i can just get 4000mah worthfullness.
If ur just looking for 6000mah battery mobile this is the worst choice.
Badly feel like cheated by samsung.
-----
LOVE TO SAMSUNG M31 "MEGA MONSTER"
-----
Samsung M31 is the best ever mobile I found till now with "6000 mAh" monster battery, superb "64 MP Quad Camera", sAMOLED Amazing display, 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM, very quick fingerprint reader and many more. I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents or videos as we required. As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.

Worst  Smartphone  don't waste 15+k here
-----
Please be assure that u experience this phone once either with friends  or Samsung  shop it is a horrible  product  screen is yellow in color after trying  all the settings  it's one and the same  also the touch doesn't  work some time it get stuck or the phone get lock and also the display  has some with touches it automatically  open any app some times the whole problem is with screen and that's what ur going to use most of the time hence if really  u want a Samsung  phone just go and buy it offline  model this online only model are just a scam does not work well the first day it worked fine but as soon as I started using  it as my primary  device  issues  started coming  to me also the battery  has some issues  6000 mah battery  giving  4he of screen on time sometimes  even less then that that to in very low usage no game no videos I watch or play hope this helps u and still waiting  for technical to come and check my product he was supposed  to come today but yet not came and scheduled  for later very bad product and support.
-----
Not satisfied
-----
Disappointed  with Samsung, after many year I decided  to back to Samsung but  truly disappointed. Worst part of Amazon policy now you can't return at alll moreover not even replace easily,  you need to install the app then you will surprise  all the problems you face shall be found ok in the software. You will be in difficult to face the situation. My strong recommendation not to go with Samsung M31.
-----
A nice Option if you use Phone for what it's meant for

Review after 2 days of use
Screen - 2 good..animations and transition very good, I won't miss hype around 90hz refresh rate
Samsung OS- one UI 2.0 is good but I personally don't like the home screen, using Lawnchair launcher for home screen and dock...Like other features of OneUI2.0
Games- Cant say, I dont use mobile for gaming
Battery- charged only once til now, so far so good
Camera- Love live focus by samsung..Boehner is applied to all faces in pic, daylight pics and Videos are awesome, yet to test night mode
Camera after 10days- indoor and low light is below average and a let down by Samsung.
This is my first Samsung Smartphone and I am glad I bought it

Opinion after 10 days- reducing rating to 3stars

Disappointing 6000 mah battery &amp; performance, but good amoled display.
-----
(After 10 days usage)
The only advantage is AMOLED display.

Performance of this phone is not at par.
Battery is also disappointing as far as 6000 MAH is given, it only last a whole day.
I was using 3500 mah phone earlier and that almost lasted same. Than 6000 mah should last too much longer than that, it's not optimised.

Phone also gets heated sometimes even in normal usage (no games)

Also build of the quality is not as standard for this range. It looks ok but actually cheap. The plastics make sounds when you feel it by fingers.

I did not find it fast enough for 6 GB RAM.
Processor is slow. CALL DIALING, and normal features also run slow on this phone.
Camera is also not very good.

To sum it up, camera, battery ,performance is not up to standards and disappointing and only good id amoled display.
-----
Totally waste
-----
Dear all pls don't pay this product. Over heating issue and slow charging time 5.30 hours in full charge over slow .and proper not working in sensor..so pls don't pay ..waste your money

Better Mobile not the best

Plastic Body

low-light camera performance

Still Its a new couple of days only I will Update later about the overall performance.

-----
Poor.....Don't buy
-----
Poor camera and display quality. Its not a 64 MP camera it's  quality is like 8 MP camera. Flash is not working in 64 MP ratio.And Amazon is also not returning this item. Vivo gives more quality in this price range. Now a days Samsung is selling it's name only not quality. Don't buy this.

Worst display having serious issue
-----
Hi all - whoever planning to buy M31 please don't its having a serious display issue showing lite pink and when we rotating less then 1 inch in any dimension its showing exact color otherwise direct view showing pink ..half showing one color half display in another color. They are not taking return for this product. Used Samsung before but now thinking never to buy anymore. I want return or replacement from amazon
-----
Worst amzon service and product by Samsung. Battery performance poor.dont take online
-----
Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products
-----
If u r buying phone for battery or camera
-----
Worst battery..its takes 2.5-3 hours to fully charge may be 3.3 hours. Battery life okay. offen hands while scrolling WhatsApp of Instagram. Screen gets black out every day for 5- 10 seconds.
Camera is good.
M series in total not good..earlier bought m20 got sick in 12 days company says not replacement , service service also repaired  but it got hanging problem again now m20 is in useless.

Well designed OS with Android 10. With Ui2.
Nice and good popup notification.as well as access this popup directly as a second screen.

Good cameras. Four cameras including of 64Mega pixels. Giving amazing performance.
Amoled display giveing different view for all applications as well as photos.

Connecting with other made very easy with in one or two steps. Like WIFI, TV,and other device's.
Awesome battery. Proofing Mega monster.
Awesome storage also a mega monster.

Well improved security level, face detection.

I feel only one disadvantage is remote sensor.
The remote sensor not in this mobile. I know before purchasing also.

Great buy. Excellent camera and battery for this price.
-----
I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.
My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.
The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.
Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.
So here are the pros and cons
PROS:
- Price
- Camera
- Battery
- Display
- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.

CONS:
- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.
- Charging could be faster

Final thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.
-----
Samsung commitment  failed
-----
As per commitment of the samsung about this  this m31 is worth less camera quality is very bad.
Other calling aap not supported.
Can't dial the WhatsApp and other call directly from contact.
After 4-5 apps open the phone performance is really slow.
Charging of the phone is really slow it takes 3 hours to full charge.. samsung cheated us.
-----
Looks good performanceüëé
-----
I phone is looks good and camera also assum.. coming to the battery its giving only one day if u using emails, WhatsApp, calls and ect.. am not including games if we using for games may be I can say half day..  heating problems is keeping charging same phone getting heat and if u do WhatsApp call also even 1 to 2 minutes getting same issue and if u talking continuously for 10 to 15 minutes same issue..
-----
Better but not Best from Samsung !!
-----
Purchased Samsung M31 on sale date and got delivered the very next day. As soon as i opened  the box i was disappointed  as there is no Screen protector or Mobile case available. Box has only mobile phone , type c cable and charger only. Phone was charged to 73%.
Now , i have been using it for past few days and i have mixed reviews about it.Display of this phone is very good and one can easily differentiate between anyother company and samung's super Amoled.Camera seems to be okayish.. it's  not that great but UI of samsung is very smooth.Batterylife is also decent compared to 6000mah.
My opinion is it will be a decent buy for 15k but dont expect too much from it.
-----
Dissapointed
-----
It's really amazing product...smooth operations...huge battery backup...premium look....feel is superb..... (first 5 days)

But
Camera quality expectations are fully embarasing. Camera wise it makes mood off.

I waited for this handset, purchased after long wait....performance is superb..but quality of camera is so so....

One more problem noticed-
Hangs too much,
Can't shut off,can't reboot,
Voice calling hanged,
No voice during calls, just mute..
Slowwwwww,
It shows UI error..

Totally disappointed...

Requested for refund/replace...waiting for good one.
-----
Worst Performance and Quality
-----
I don't know this issue for all M31 devices or only my device. Camera quality is very very very bad.. If you do little zoom, you can see black lines are coming and going..If you record video, more than 30 minutes..getting message "camera not responding message"...Not happy with the audio
-----
Great Camera, battery and Display.
-----
Battery life and fast charging is opposite to what company promises
-----
1. Camera is not up to the expectation
2. Battery doesn't seem to be 6000 Mah it hardly last 1 day further takes 2.5 to 3 hrs to get fully charged worried if this is huge battery life and fast charging, what will be the normal one from Samsung.

Hope the company have test check the features, if not kindly do it to get the correct facts.

Other brands which are way smaller than the samsung brand offer better performance.
-----
This is an average phone just with battery backup only  and not great w r to speed and performance
-----
I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.

Pros:
------
&gt;&gt; no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.
&gt;&gt; Good battery backup
&gt;&gt; Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.

Cons:
------
&gt;&gt; Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.
&gt;&gt; we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.
&gt;&gt; This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.
&gt;&gt; This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).
&gt;&gt; Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!
&gt;&gt; The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.
&gt;&gt; This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.
&gt;&gt; The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.
&gt;&gt; My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.

Conclusion:
-------------
An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.
-----
Pro and cons
-----
Camera(VIDEO STABILIZATION dosent work) , battery are good . Phone heats up a little bit but that heating is acceptable .

Screen is not as good as Nokia screens and others (IPS LCD ) , IPS LCD would have given a better performance .

Screen doesn't give Natural colours.

Performance is good . Fingerprint sensor is awsome , it works very Smoothly .

The software has better options .

Mirror link is not supported by this mobile . If they had provided Mirror screen option then it would have been great ,no 3rd party app supports mirror link .

Charging cable is too short .

Camera is not as good as Nokia 8.1 ,6 .

If the mobile gets IPS LCD SCREEN , SONY IMX CAMERA then the mobile would be so awesome

Samsung and Amazon both decieved....
-----
I was using Samsung J2 earlier,  excellent phone,  later shifted to moto X4....after long time switching again to Samsung after hearing the success of M30s. Little disappointed. It's an average mobile phone.
1.The finish of the phone is below average. If we use this mobile without back cover,  please will judge that this guy is using cheap Mobile,  I am covering it up with spigen cover now. It is not even like Samsung J2 mobile. Poor plastic.(ABS).
2. CAMERA,  I use to take lot of mobile photographs  it's my hobby,  I don't see any difference in this megapixel and 3 or 4 camera's....if you are better cameraman, single camera is enough,  since it is with 4 camera we try to take different pictures,  camera okay. Lot of night in low light. Macro is 5 MP, no clear picture....
3. Reception of Mobil signal, I felt slightly weak,  when I compare with motoX4, I was using it for nearly 2 years, now with M31s, I am not getting proper data connectivity inside home. Further I have to check...
4. Mobile phone is mobile slightly heating up, not like mi,  but it is not like earlier Samsung.
5. Battery it mega but last for one complete day, there is ko need to search charger in the evening,  but we need to charge it in the night, the charging time is long since the battery 6000mah. There will be possibilities of partial charging of battery, which may reduce the life of battery.
Samsung could have done better, looks like urgently cooked...
Can we replace with M30s?...
-----
Good replacement for J series in this price tag
-----
Fair review after one week of usage:
Pros: 1. The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.
2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.
3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.
4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.
5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.
6. Battery life is quite very good.
7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.
8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.
9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.
Cons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn‚Äôt expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.
2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.
3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.
4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.
5. The charging is a bit slow.
6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn‚Äôt expected with this processor and android version.
7. The sound output could have been more.
8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.
9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.
The phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage. Though its the best phone in all the lower range series of samsung.
-----
Superb experience  with Samsung m31
-----
The phone is very amazing it's more than expectation. I ordered black version with 6GB of ram and 128 GB space. Best smartphone in this segment price. The trump card  of this phone is camera. What a wide angle and selfie  captured by this phone amazingly good..  all the best feature you will get on this price.
-----
Only Indian sim card labeled phone. Don't buy if you want to use outside India.
-----
Received my Samsung Galaxy M31 on 7th Mar. It cost me 15,999 rupees.

Literally shocked to see the Indian sim card only labeled on box.

Immediately called Amazon customer and their response is pathetic. They said they cannot write everything about product.

Product description is based on what features they want to show to customer. As it is a electronic item so there is no return possible, only replacement option is available if there is any fault in the product and cannot do anything more.

They are not ready to accept the fact that they are hiding such a important information that this phone cannot be used outside India.

Learnt my lesson and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in future.

They are only good enough for groceries and small items.
-----
A good budget Smartphone
-----
I spend my first salary on the first day of the online launch and I am happy to have a good phone on the next day at my doorstep with all the features that I would like to on my phone.
So here are Pros:
6000 mAh Battery
64MP Quad Rear camera
32 MP Front Camera
6GB Ram
Fast charging
Smooth Touch display
Pop-up view feature
Android 10
4K video recording
Fastest face unlock
-----
Branded alternative for Redmi phones at this price range
-----
Pros:
1. Display is good especially dark images or videos look great
2. Really a monstrous battery
3. Selfie camera is better
4. Fingerprint sensor is fast
5. OS is fluidic without any lag
6. Call quality and reception is good
7. No ads and the default Apps can be deleted

Neutral:
1. External speaker volume is decent but not great. Would be great if they provide stereo speakers like in the Nokias

Cons:
1. Primary Camera is decent but not great. 64 MP is just a number on paper. My 16 MP LG V20 camera takes better photos.
2. Phone is little heavy

Conclusion:
If you don't want Redmi Note series phones then this is the best branded alternative at this price point
-----
Very good product for the price...
-----
The Amazon tamper proof packaging &amp; timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.
The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.
After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.
I like the look &amp; feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.
Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front &amp; rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.
For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).
In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.
-----
Good Phone at 16k with a massive battery.
-----
It's an upgrade to the M30s. The screen is good with a raindrop camera. The Super Amoled display is quite good to use even while at outdoors.
The massive 6000 mah battery easily gives backup upto 1.5 days on moderate to heavy usage.
It takes around 2 hours 40 mins to 3 hours on initial charging from zero to 100 percent.
For Gamers there a Game Booster App.

The camera is also quite good with lots of options to choose from.

Cons:
The phone has some bloatwares, some from samsung, and some third party like Helo app. Some apps like fb can only be disabled.

Overall a Good Phone, and the massive 6000mah battery is really good for moderate to heavy users.
-----
Waste of money...dont buy it...
-----
Weak signal antenna...Flash and wide angle camera don't work with 64MP camera..battery performance don't look like 6000mh. Both front and rear camera quality is bad...making false advertisement on camera and battery performance...don't think you are getting quality features in Rs.16000..if you buy it you are big fool..
-----
Amazon rejected my last feedback.
-----
Amazon what was wrong with my last feedback?

Dear All,
Buy at your own health and money risk! Not sure what happened to Samsung and Amazon India standards of leadership and customer first.

Best in class, but with a few exceptions
-----
Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.

This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:

First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.

Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.

Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.

If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?
-----
Awesome buy !! So far so good !! Heavy Duty Battery. Top specs at a reasonable price.
-----
I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.
This phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.

Now coming to the phone :

Pros :-
1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.
2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.
3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.
4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.
5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.
6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.
Other conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.

Now coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :
1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.
2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.
3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.

Overall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)
-----
Slow charging
-----
Over heating issue and slow charging time 5 hours in full charge over slow .and proper not working in sensor..so pls don't pay ..waste your money
-----
BAAP of Power and features
-----
I bought this phone as soon as it was launched, a month ago after my Galaxy S10 was stolen. I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.
What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.
So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.
-----
Fullon value  for money  .
-----
Awesome  screen .
Awesome battery  .
Awesome  cameras .
Specially  ... one UI 2.0 of Samsung  is superb. I used Samsung  Galaxy  alot but for 2-3yrs i was on moto and others ... but being  back to Samsung ... it's  worth it .

Go for it ... the screen is just min blowing  at this price . No one can beat it .

Also .. I don't  play any games ... but i read alot and watch plenty of movies ...but being  an experienced  smartphone  user i can tell ... it can run any game without  lag .. with 6 gb + exynos 9611 processors (if I'm  ri8) . Same as A51 which cost 24k .

Just go for it .

1 thing is plastic body ... but body is also very good ... not like previous  plastic  Samsung  ... it's  glossy ... but any way we are gonna use back case  ... so it doesn't matter  anyway .

1 thing - Biometric  take some time to get use to i guess.

It's  a large device ... side fingerprint  would have been best .
And face unlock  take some time ..... face unlock is not that good i would say . But may be due to extra security  .. we have to make sure of correct  angle and light  .
-----
Falsely advertised device!
-----
I feel cheated. This phone sucks. Battery lasts less than my 4000 mah battery. The "64mp" camera shows more blurriness and pixels than my redmi note 7 pro which has 48mp camera.

The phone's screen also looks kinda cheap although performs well, the build quality of the device is far bellow standards. Extremely disappointed. Beware. This phone has many PAID reviews that speak highly about this device.
-----
Superb Budget Phone by Samsung
-----
Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.

*Camera:

Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.
Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.

* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.

* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:
--&gt; Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)
--&gt; 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming
--&gt; 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)
Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.

* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.

* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.

* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.

* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).

* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...
--&gt; Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)
--&gt; Personally love the Dark Mode.

Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.
-----
Worst phone, don't buy
-----
Worst phone ever bought, don't  buy, charging slow, heating issues,  phone  gets heated in one small call, I will  return it,...
-----
Best in the price range
-----
Wonderful phone for this budget. People talk about lot of specs in the phones like xiaomi  and poco in this price range. But Samsung has all that and longevity as well. Samsung phones don't die on you.
The camera setup on this phone is wonderful, the detailing it captures, the colors, the selfies  every thing is perfect.
The huge 6000mah battery, just wow. It will easily last for 2 days if not more. Even with high youtubeing and social networking it will last for 2 days.
Signal receiving strength is excellent and to add to that it has wifi-calling option as well.
Speakers are good, but real deal is listening the music through head phones, it supports Dolby atmos.
The rear mounted finger print sensor is at the right place and super fast.
The 6.4 inch AMOLED screen is next level. Its Samsung so you can't expect nothing less.
With 6 GB RAM the multi tasking is really good.
Overall wonderful phone with very decent pricing and its Samsung.  It can't get any better than this in this price range.
So go for it and this phone will definitely surprise you.

5. Got OS update yesterday- Feb Security Patch included.

Cons:
1. Must be given some back cover in the Box.
2. No headset included in the box.
3. Earphone slot is given at a downside which makes it difficult to handle the phone.

Proud to own a "Made in India" handset
-----
It's been only a few days of purchase.  So far the experience is good. My usage is minimal for basic emails, social media chats, picture sharing etc. Very less usage for voice/video calls as well. No gaming. Battery seems to last three days easily on one full charge.
What makes me proud to own this device is that in all the years I have owned a cell phone, this is the first time I am holding a "Made in India" device. Proud of that . Will post an update later based on future experience
-----
Worth the price but features are a failure
-----
I am a tech guy and this review is genuine. First of all Samsung is the baap of mobiles..coming to m31 I waited so long to buy and saw many reviews.lets start from positive..
1. Camera is awesome both front and back. Picture clarity in zoom is good
2. Very smooth finish of mobile which looks really great
3. Touch is better than other mobiles compared to Oppo or MI
Coming to negative points
all reviews almost fake regarding battery...they just really bluffed..6000 mah battery is not even coming for 2 full days..I used data for around 18 hrs but still it got drained fast.
When charged the mobile it taking around 4 hrs to get complete charge from 0 to 100 percentage  but mobile is getting heated a lot..didn't expect this from Samsung at all.
Loud speaker is not so efficient.
Normal sound is good
As its SAMOLED the picture or video quality is good..eyes r not strained
-----
Mixed feelings
-----
I purchased this mobile based on previous Samsung galaxy mobile experience. Now i've mixed feelings on it.

These are my observations after single day use.

1. Rear camera quality is extraordinary unless you zoom it.
2. Front camera isn't that great. Beauty mode is always on and photos are patchy.
3. Samsung KNOX isn't preinstalled. So, you can't use "Secure Folder". Need to install "S Secure" app for app lock.
4. Guesture screenshot didn't work.
5. Phone is slightly heated while updating and installing apps.
6. OS is so smooth.
7. Fingerprint reader unlocks the mobile swiftly.

Update: after multiple days of regular use
1. So far battery lasts almost 2 days with regular usage. Like YouTube, Facebook and etc.,
2. Though it's of 6GB ram, I noticed lag and phone stuck frequently.
3. Front cam needs a lot of improvement
4. Call quality isn't that great
5. You can hear full voice only when tye voulme is completely up or almost full. Same applies to earphones as well.

Verdict: Go with this mobile if you're expecting a good rear camera and better battery performance.
-----
Overall highly satisfied with the phone
-----
Received the phone 10 days back. After a long gap I am back to Samsung Brand and I must say the phone is awesome almost in all departments. The performance of 6GB/128 GB handset is definitely above the mark, ergonomically designed phone fits into the palm well , hence its a pleasure to hold the phone. The camera quality is good, ease of using, navigation is extremely user friendly and the  finger print sensor is good, not yet explored face recognition feature. Most of the important apps are pre installed hence its again a plus point and more importantly Microsoft tools are re preinstalled, Just one draw back which I  found in the phone as of now is the app lock facility is not available need to install a separate app from the play store, this should have given as a preinstalled feature.My verdict is go for the phone its an awesome piece not from china so that's another satisfaction of holding this handset.

Good product by Samsung.
-----
Best smartphone in this budget.

Selfies had good impressions due to 32 mp front camera. No need to press buttons for selfy.
Very smooth display.
Sound quality ok.
But in headphones very good quality.
Only one issue is NFC connectivity is not available.
Rest every thing super.
-----
Not worth it..
-----
I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily. The WiFi calling sometimes does not work!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not the same as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better with my old phone of 5000mah...could do 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'.
-----
Happy with my choice
-----
It's really good device. Battery is a freaking beast, amoled display is beautiful and UI is very slick and simple. I got nothing to complaint considering what I paid for it. I would never buy crappy Xiaomi phones with its obscene notifications. Go for samsung phones, they don't push anything vulgar with their phones.
-----
Need some camera improvements by update
-----
I brought this phone because of camera and battery. Battery is fine but i expected more from camera the details of camera is poor when you zoom the image even 4x digital and optical. Recently i broughted m30s 2 weeks ago and it has some issues so i returned it and i am telling you there is no major upgrade on rare 64mp camera mode. It's almost look like m30s 48mp photos. I watched many youtubers saying this is the best camera with this price but i think it needs importants because when i zoom in after taking a image its details are gone its look like 2mp image. But i think Samsung can fix this problem with software upgrade and overall this phone is good and also I don't know why they bother giving a macro camera , it's pathetic it's can't get too close and the details are pathetic link 0.5 mp . And if samsung fix this issue with update i will update my review.

Not As Expected
-----
First time I plugged in for charging. Phone displayed recovery mode screen though I haven't pressed any button. Totally disappointed by this experience.
I have requested to return this item and refund me entire amount but amazon policy relaxed upto replacement.
Bad experience.

Display and look wise phone looks stunning but still I haven't used it so system performance might be well as expected. I hope so.

Waiting for brand new replacement of M31. I hope it would work well

Bang for the Buck üî•

Moved from a Moto G5s Plus to Samsung .
Pros :
1. S-amoled display is just fluid , smooth and oh ghosh the deep blacks and the punchy colors . Undoubtedly the best display under 15K
2. 6000mah battery easily lasts for a day and half with heavy usage like 2hrs of Pubg , lots of social media stuff , photographs  etc .
3. 64Mp Camera is a beast when it comes to details but the 16MP auto mode is the best where this device shines as the HDR and algorithms by samsung are just so perfect . No image over processing nothing . The Ultra Wide is the best as said by many top reviewers and the Macro camera captures details and quality as it's a 5MP shooter .
4. Exynos 9611 well its brilliant . Don't go for the benchmarks . Performance is superb bcz of the optimization . No lags and stutters . PUBG plays at HD and High frame rates by default and plays smoothly as well . That was a surprise to me also bcz I never thought of exynos handling games so good .
5. The phone is not too heavy and looks pretty good overally and the Dolby atmos has its own magic when you're connected to bluetooth or wired headphones .

Cons :

1. I have noticed the screen heating ( not the back of the phone ) rarely or honestly I'll tell when I was playing PUBG for 1hr 30 mins odd at HD graphics . But when I changed it to Balanced or smooth I didn't notice any such heating .

2. The speakers of the phone naturally reduce while playing PUBG but it's not the case in playing other games .
3. The back of the phone is plastic and thus it's a fingerprint magnet genuinely. Do buy a back cover for avoiding scratches.

Simply the Beast.. Wonderful from SAMSUNG

Amazing phone..

Worst of all, Give back my money, NEVER GONNA BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG
-----
The WORST phone you can get in this range, front camera pics quality is so worst that it looks like an oil paint job with all smudged, NO SHARPNESS at all. The curve of display is so round it doesn't even  feel like a rounded rectangle, it's an OVAL. EVERTHING IS PLASTIC, The software processing, image processing, performance processing  is just bad, no its WORST. The game booster which is provided doesn't  seems like its boosting anything than consumption of battery. A LOT OF HEAT IS GENERATED in usage of 1 hour even while doing normal tasks.
In conclusion, even if someone  is giving  this SAMSUNG M31 for free DON'T BUY IT.  M31 is just a hoax of a specs and nothing more, the worst of all. This was my first samsung phone, gone with the brand's name and it's simply disappointing,
NEVER GONNA BUY ANOTHER  SAMSUNG PRODUCT
Now with this AMAZON POLICY OF NOT REFUNDING, feels like the most regrettable decision of the year, feels like mental torture spending 17K for this M31. SIMPLY WORST. Seriously  need my money back, NEED REFUND for this product, WORST PRODUCT in every aspect.
-----
Worth for every penny
-----
Let‚Äôs start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.

Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.

Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review

The Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.

Galaxy M31

That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.

In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.

Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review

Galaxy M31

The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.

Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.

Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review

Galaxy M31

The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.

On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company‚Äôs custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.
-----
Overrated and Hyped
-----
Battery life is better than my previous phone which was a 4000MAh. I am yet to rigorously test it through gaming and continuous wifi or data being on.

Camera on the front does a horrible job. Shame on Samsung that they name it a 32Mp camera. The back camera does a decent job but not upto the expectation of a quad camera set with 64Mp.

RAM is pretty good and I feel the phone has no lag and it doesn't hang.

Speaker voice quality is average and could be  better.

The body is extremely disappointing as it's a fingerprint magnet and Samsung doesn't give you a back cover at least.

Facial recognition takes a lot of time

Conclusion: can't expect any better than this on the price range.
However, samsung and Amazon have blown the hype out of proportion especially when they know that business value is lesser when competing with the likes of Xiaomi or Vivo or Realme
-----
Not worth to buy
-----
Operating and dispaly is not good
Not user friendly
Not as per expexted quality
-----
Best smartphone under Rs. 20k
-----
I purchased Samsung NEW on the very day of its launch. Got delivery next day. Actually it arrived before estimated time.
This I have been using the phone for about one week now. It's a fantastic phone.
1. Design, slimness, weight is very impressive.
2. Display sAMOLED is simply superb. Color production stunning.
3. I have purchased M30s also a few months ago. M31's display is even better than M30s.
4. Battery lasts for about 2 days on usual use time. I have Samsung On Max also. Which I have to charge twice a day. But NEW easily runs for 2 days.
5. Camera is also very good, both rear and front. I have taken some night photos without using flash. They, beautifully captured the subjects with clear details. Front camera is equally good.
6. It's lighter than M30s (which is also having 6000mah battery).
7. Phone doesn't get heated up much even on continuous use.
8. One good feature Samsung has added is caller identity. It detects spams automatically. No need to install Truecaller.
9. It also has QR Code scanner. This is very helpful.
Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price range. I am fully satisfied having purchased this phone
-----
Disappointed  with battery backup - not looks like 6000mah
-----
Brought M31 128 gb variant . Phone looks great and display really nice. But battery  life is not seems to be like 6000mah . For simple usage YouTube videos,online songs- battery drains fast  .  I was using lg w30 as temporary mobile (3000mah)I feel that mobile backup was good.

After some day will update my comments if any changes
-----
Average phone
-----
Average phone ..not looks premium
Camera performance is ok not so excelent .
Screen also ok but not so much clear as explained ,scrach marks easily can be noticed if it comes it touch with rough surface.

Overall average product ...not matching with samsung brand name .

Great for camera freaks and exhaustive users ( extended battery life)
-----
Its been 10 days since i have started using the phone. There are certain things i'd like to mention.

Pros: great camera, you get the best pictures even in dim light (YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH REALME PICTURES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT USE FILTERS, IT GIVES HIGH QUALITY PICTURES, IF U NEED BEAUTIFICATION THEN THE FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE IN CAMERA SETTINGS), finger print reader is upto the mark, screen is very handy, it has got some great inbuilt features, speakers are good for one room echo,face detection is also one great feature in it. Battery  is one great perk. I charge it once in 1.5 days.

Cons: hangs a lot while transferring file to another phone,occationally malfunctions and restarts without command, follows command with a little delay at some point, as compared to my MI A1 i find this phone a little not upto the mark in terms of performance. Super slow in charging. It looks like it takes for ever to charge.

Apart from the camera i dont think it has anything super good to discuss. Its like a regular phone that one can buy.
 We as youngsters  are more obsessed with the camera thing and battery life, hence this phone is everything in terms of those. I haven't played games on it and hence i dont know how will that be.
I am rating it 5 beacuse the cons i mentioned are temporary, it does not affect over all performance. I am satisfied i keep downloading files, use microsoft office on it, play youtube,click pictures and little stuffs so it works fine for me.
-----
Bootloop after update
-----
This phone is great with battery backup and picture quality but within 8 days the phone got in bootloop as sson as I got a new update and I did it. This is not even starting now.
-----
Top smartphone -  sAMOLED display and 64 Mp Camera for price Rs.15,000 to 20,000
-----
Samsung Galaxy M31 gives you a very high value for the price. Given my price range and the features I was looking for, it was hands-down the best smartphone in the market right now.
At this price range, Samsung offers a lot of features in this smartphone that the other brands have not. For example -  AMOLED SCREEN, An enormous 6000 mAh battery and also a 64-megapixel quad-camera!!!
This phone makes watching movies a pleasure due to the AMOLED screen for immersive viewing experience and the Dolby Sound as a cherry on the cake.
I also, do recommend this product for novice photographers.
Conclusion: I am freaking loving this smartphone
-----
Not so good phone after use
-----
I have noticed below issues with phone.
* camera: it cuts photo frame in ouput photo due to this u do not get actual image of what seen on screen, it cut about a inch from sides.
* battery: takes tooooo long to charge if phone is made on charging at 20% than it takes 3 hours to reach in nineties that too if no other work is done and phone is kept idle.
Also battery drains out easily
* Heating issue: phone is getting hot at charging time, regular use of data. And not only back screen too gets hot considerably.
While video calling pop up comes that whatsapp is making phone hot, close whatsapp otherwise will close in 20 sec.
-----
A beast by its value for money
-----
Battery life is great as it easily lasts for over 48 hrs of usage in single charge. Vibrant colours - probably the best and refreshing colour combinations (especially in the dark mode) for menus and adaptive colour and brightness settings are top notch. Smart and smooth UI is simple to use and highly responsive, Samsung has added some of the new cool features to the UI which are very useful. Fast processor (I am not a gamer) functions without any lag. Camera quality is Fantastic in good light conditions including the front camera, the picture taken are very close to their natural colours. Overall an excellent value for money. Go for it. Highly recommended.
-----
Poor battery performence
-----
Battery takes nearly 5 hours to charge completly.... Wen compared to other phones with fast chargers which can complete 100% in 1 hour ...so in 5 hours we can chargr 5 times  completly other phonez....in this genration waiting for 5 hours to complete for battery to charge is really big mistake by samsung..... Touch sensitivity  is Also poor and performanece is also not good
-----
A nice buy for me
-----
I thoroughly like this mobile.
Very smooth to handle.
The camera is very good in day light and medium to low light.
The battery back up is awesome. It took 40 hours for the mobile battery to go from 100 % to 23 %. In this timeframe I had medium usage of the mobile also I used it with wats app live tracking with GPS on for my cycling trip for 8 hours. Also around 3 hours of Google map use.
Though I cannot comment much on gaming experience as I don't play games on mobile, but just to experience played subway surfers for 10 minutes and it performed good.
Overall a good buy for me as I was searching for a mobile with nice camera and battery.
-----
disappointment ......
-----
I have a good working phone -samsung A8 plus.. still purchased this phone as I  was excited with its features of 64 MP camera and 6000 mAmp battery-- both these features are a huge disappointment in this phone
no differnce from A8+ - or even worse
no back cover/screen guard; purchased them online, before they come and start using this phone -return window expired..
No fast charging as claimed, infact very very slow charging.......

atleast no heating issues like other cheaper brands
screen, touch sensitivity, fast processor -- are good
sound is again a disappointment
slow motion video and live focus on both cameras, both sim Volte enabling  - are the good features
-----
Camera quality
-----
Phone is ok.
Battery is good enough, there only plus point.
Face detection does not work very poor,
OTG is very good, Doc. Files transferred open directly without going through any app.
Keyboard features not good in comparison to Google.
Camera quality is just ok.
Palm screen shot is not good.
Adaptive screen doesn't work.
Phone is slow.
Power on off is missing.
Plastic back cover gets scratched very fast.
Videos plays in 2 steps, one in off volume.
Samsung phones are not good for gear S2 watches, it connects through Samsung galaxy store which which does not show all the faces as In other phones &amp; it also does not show the purchased watch faces.
-----
Okay, until this happened
-----
I can't believe within a month the phone screen started showing lines.

19/05/2020 May Update: Went to the service center in Delhi and the lady and the manager said I'd need to pay if anything is broken. What's the warranty for? I asked what's the "Gorilla Glass" for if it couldn't handle a pocket fall (which is what they said happened)? And their reply, "We are insiders. So we understand these things, there's no such thing as "gorilla vorilla" it's a normal mirror. If it falls and breaks then you'll have to pay for this."

I can't believe Samsung has been making a fool of us all these years. Can anyone else confirm this "insider" info? Meanwhile, the rest of you should keep this in a bank locker.

Best in the price range (GO FOR IT)
-----
Excellent product..the specifications of this phone are truly amazing and not just on paper , the performance  of the phone doesn't let you down at any instant. The fingerprint reader is quick to respond and has no delay in unlocking the phone.  The camera is the highlight of this phone which allows users to capture splendid pictures (64MP) I myself have clicked numerous  pictures and haven't  faced any issues with the camera. The battery  life of this phone is more than adequate  for daily usage as well as gaming(performs well while running heavy games also).
 I'm extremely  pleased with the product and would recommend  this phone to anyone  looking for a smooth and hassle free experience.
-----
Worst Product ever, Don't go for it
-----
Its OS Software got crashed in first update build release and it happened to all the M31 devices
-----
An underappreciated budget phone
-----
There are lots of negative review which led me to confusion before buying this, but this phone is worth the price.
Display- awesome, colors , touch rsponse...all good.
Battery- long backup, even if u play games. Around 14 hrs display time (medium usage)
Charging - a bit slow, takes 2 hrs from 25 to 100
Camera- good color production,  decent picture quality (not a sony sensor, so don't expect that quality), macro is nice. Selfie (both angle) decent. Overall for day to day usage it's very good. But not for pro shooters.
Processor- thought it would be the biggest drawback, but it is not, pubg and asphault runs well in smooth(not hdr)

Overall i will recommend this phone to all who use phone for day to day usage(no hardcore gaming but big games with casual setting will run well), love to support made in india products.
Thank you.

A good value  of money and feature loaded product.

The Box Contents :
The Phone, Charger(15W), C-Type Charging-cum-usb Cable, Some Related Papers

First Impressions :
The Package was packed well and the Samsung  Box was compact.
The phone has a impresive design and the weight was well distributed.

After a week usuge:
1. Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained  even in bright sunlight  you see the display  pretty  well. The viewing  angles  are also good. No color  changes  when views angles  gets changed. No queries  from my side.

2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla  Glass 3 protection  at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared  to other phones  of this budget  section( of course thanks to massive battery).

3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.

4. Front Camera: Performed  well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed  texture  on the face(just turn off the Beauty  effect) and the one of the main function  is that during  calls, front camera  is used as ambient  light sensor  to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's  all about the habbit  that is to be developed with time.

5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played  musics of high  frequency  and bass, at high sound it losses  it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.
The ear piece sound quality  is exceptionally  great.

6. Rear Cameras:  The design  of Quad Cameras  impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.

The 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice  the overall  quality  of normal 16MP photos  are a bit rich as compared  to 64MP photos as capturing  image in 64MP and rendering  it to 16MP increases  it's  quality.

The Live Focus  is impressive and the blurring  edge of the photos  is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial  lighting.  I am satisfied very well.

The wide camera Performed  pretty  well and got satisfactory  results.

I am bit disappointed  with the Macro Lens that didn't  performed well, however  in multiple  shots I got a good quality  macro photo. But using main camera  for macro photos gives great results.

The LED was pretty  good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally  well.

7. Battery:  Yes the massive  6000mAH battery  is worth  called massive. I got the screen-on period  of 10hours in a single  charge.  On using it in a average way gave me around  30 hours of backup.

8. Performance:  I experienced  buttery smooth  performance in using  it in above average usage.  But I will say that you can get  a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance  as it doesn't  got a gaming  processor.
But in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.

The only visible  difference  between  M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement  of secondary  mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which  is on the right in M30s

As a average user 60Hz display  is okay for me, I didn't  experienced  any frame  drops.

Overall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.

I will reccomend  this product  for average  users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.

Critical but true!!
-----
Before buying this phone, I had some doubt but after using this for almost one month, I am üíØ percent sure to say that, Samsung mid range phones are shit,
Front camera quality is as bad as VGA one,
Rear camera: always struggles to focus on close clicks, this phone has 64 MP camera but even my 16 MP phone camera perform far better, I can share the pics for comparison,
Battery: this phone comes with 6000 battery but works as 4500 battery back up, maximum 12 hours, and the slow charging add more dimerit to it,
Display: good,
Performance: bad, very very bad, I don't know if my phone has some problem or Samsung is just proving it's  legacy of bad performaing mid range phones, this phone starts lagging while opening very normal apps, like WhatsApp, and YouTube, in have to say that m31 is  1.5 second slow in opening any app in comparison with my 4 GB RAM  cell phone.
Design: does not feel sleek and premium in hand due to plastic body, but we could take that bulky design if battery works as expected because it has 6000 mah battery in it, but battery performance of this phone is simply bad.

Sorry Samsung for this critical and negative review, but I have to say that you need to work on your midrange phones as well,

Irresistable, stable, able n affordable! S31
-----
I have been purchasing Samsung M series phones for self and family for years now and never regretted my choices. The M30s for my FiL and this lovely M31 for myself are both excellent phones at a very very competitive price. With the lastest Android 10 OS and access to both Google and Galaxy playstores, an incredible Amoled screen with excellent touch sensitivity etc., this is a beautiful choice. With a monster battery, even without aggressive conservation settings, you get good milage. The new USB connector is a joy, with the option of high power charging for those urgencies when traveling.. backed by Amazon's super logistics and accessories options, this is a great buy!

Awesome Phone - Vegu Sirappu (Tamil)
-----
Good things are
1.Awesome cameras, both front and rear (a shot using macro mode is attached)
2.Excellent processing speed
3.Battery withstands more than 30 hours ( all time mobile data enabled, camera was used many times, normal WhatsApp usage but I never play video games).
4. Wonderful display experience (far better than my previous (Galaxy on next)
5. Low SAR value (0.38 W/kg as per manual) and No heating issues during the above mentioned usage.
6. Highly comfortable UI to use the phone
7. Face recognition is good (can't find fault)
8. All the features are really good and high end configuration under Rs. 15000
9. I feel Very comfortable to have this phone and it is really worthy

Improvements required are
1. Call volume is little less and loud speaker volume also littleless (I don't have any hearing issues)
2. It takes more than a hour to fully charge But it may be acceptable because of 6000 mAh Battery.
3. Samsung should have sold this good phone with headphone. So, without headphone I feel this sale is incomplete
-----
Best buy for the budgetüòÅ‚úåÔ∏è
-----
It is the best phone for the budget from a brand lik samsung all though there is small flaws lik the main 64mp cam is a wide angle lens which looks a bit odd wit a slight fish eye effect and in low lighting it produces lot of noise but u get good detailing and the colour reproduction is amazing and lastly the processor could hv been even better i feel its not that its bad now but still could hv been better overall i rate an 8/10 for the mobile and s 1 more thing u should be aware of is that it doesn't support Samsung pay and Knox. Thank you for your time in taking time reading my comment hv fun peace ‚úåÔ∏è continuing my review after 3 days of usage i could find that charging time takes almost 2 and half hrs and sometimes 3 even though it supports fast charging upto 3hrs
-----
No Samsung Pay, Exceptional battery life, light ergonomic phone, rapidly improving camera
-----
Best features, Ergonomics: The two best things about the phone are its 6000 mah battery and its weight balance which makes it feel way lighter than its 192 grams. The polycarbonate back means you don't need a case and can use this phone bareback which is nice(just rub down with a damp cloth from time to time to get rid of the fingerprints) A faux leather back would have been better but nothing much to complain about.

 Battery: On the battery front, the performance is exceptional(7.5 hours on lte and medium brightness, and 13 hours on wifi) and if you switch off the phone and charge, it can charge up from 20% in under 2 hours.

 Camera: The camera was really bad out of the box but got a massive upgrade in especially low light images after the February patch. Samsung are likely to further improve the camera with updates. One irritation currently is that you can't use the flash and the wide angle at the same time which makes no sense.

 Performance: Performance is good for day to day tasks especially if you go to the settings and "reduce animations" You can also use ram and cache cleaning apps on the playstore to clean your ram and cache with a single click from time to time.

 Hardware: Gyroscope and compass are there. Samsung used to skimp on these in the past. A macro lens is also available along with the ultrawide. Unfortunately no IR blaster and no zoom lens(depth sensor instead) Also no Samsung Pay or Knox security

Display: The display gets better if you tweak it. Out of the box, you get somewhat warm colors. You can also hide the notch the same way as the M30s(look it up on YouTube) Because it is an amoled screen, this works perfectly and you get an uninterrupted display. Overall good experience

Sound: The sound of the earphone jack is not punchy but there is no distortion or noise either so good for soft music. You can probably improve the output further with a third party equalizer. The single speaker is clear and reasonably loud. No distortion and good for speech. But not punchy or good for playing music(but then that's what Bluetooth speakers are for)

Software: You get Android 10 out of the box. I had heard that some people had trouble with using vpn apps after an Android 10 update but fortunately that's not true. Only software con so far is that a native screen recorder is not a available out of the box(so there may be no way of recording internal audio) Further you can't sideload apps from a third party file explorer. You have to use the built in one. We have to see if it improves with updates. Also you have a screen flash and camera flash feature you can turn on for notifications in the absence of a led notification light

 Who should buy: People who want the sharpest data capture on their camera and the best gaming performance may look elsewhere, but if you want a reliable rom(I have had files corrupted, especially those on the micro sd card on multiple occasions with MIUI especially during updates), top class battery life, good customer service, and a good quality amoled screen with perfect notch hiding, this is a really good phone. The lack of Samsung Pay is annoying and the main reason for cutting a star. Other things like the older processor were already on the table
-----
Good products but improvements is need we didn't expect without cons with in 20k from samsung
-----
To be frank!! I didn't find any usefull thing in M31 but we want to spend the money only for brand the only reason to buy this is for superamloed display finger print reader is slow when we are receiving calls it display after 10sec call reception is also slow samsung  must be concentrate on UI camera is good battery life is excellent but I didn't test how many minutes it will take to charge the full battery
  The worst thing is charger other brands are providing best cable and adapter when we touch the other brand chargers we feel like premium but samsung chargers are worst like 100 rs road side chargers and also back panel attracts the fingers easily samsung should concentrate on lot of improvements in UI
  Apart this the mobile is good one who are not students if you are a student to buy this you are must be a normal users not heavy users

Phone hanging frequently and Internet closing abruptly
-----
Good thing is that I got the phone delivered withing just 4 hours on the launch date in March 2020.

As per suggestion I updated phone immediately

The look and feel is nice. Phone quality is good. Also it has AI features in the camera. E.g I can point the phone camera to Text and it can translate, I can point phone to pics, cars etc, and I can information about it.

Phone charging is good. It has fast charging, but since battery is 6000 mAH, it takes long time to charge, no complaint about it.

However I have experience the phone hanging on the usual applications such as Google Chrome, Internet explorer. The Text box does not open up. I need to close the application and reopen it so that I can type the URL, search criteria of my choice.

Once this phone restarted on its own.

Also I have experienced that the Mobile data turns off automatically and it does not get on even though in the settings the Mobile data is turned on.

Like most of the people I am using Data from JIO which is inserted in SIM1. Today I set the data for SIM 1, no idea how it got selected for SIM2. Please note that I have not opted for Data in the SIM 2 and hence whenever the data from SIM2 is used then heavy charges are applied.

Because of these issues I faced giving 3 stars.
-----
Great
-----
Positives:
Great battery life
Nice screen, thank you amoled
Convenient features, fast connectivity (Bluetooth, wifi)
Has not frozen once. No software issues yet
Negatives:
Face recognition and finger print recognition are iffy.
Front facing camera is not sharp at all. Looks like my 2008 computer built in webcam
Samsung apps that can't be removed. (Why add bloatware that no one uses anyways?)
Plastic body while Redmi has metal bodies at the same price point

Still, a great phone at this price. I keep hearing rumors about how Samsung phones slow down after a few years, I'll see if that's the case and update this review accordingly. But right now, I do recommend buying it.
-----
The best phone in this price segment.
-----
My review after using the phone after 8 days of continuous use as I have ordered it on the day of launch 5th March.

Pros:
1. The battery is humongous. it's 6000 Mah. It will last for at least 2 days for normal use. For extensive use like 12 hrs of video stream then it will last at least 24-30 hours.

2. Exynos 9611 processor comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.

3. It comes with Android 10.0 which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.

4. The camera can capture 4K videos too and the camera quality is really  very good both rear as well as front.

5. It has an impressive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with minimal bezels.

6. It has polycarbonate back which isn‚Äôt as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.

7. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).

8. With 6 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far. 128 GB storage is quite enough.

9. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).

10. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.

Cons:-

1. Night mode isn‚Äôt the best.

2. It supports a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M31 is decent but not rich enough.

3. It doesn't come with earphones.

4. It comes with a 15W type-c charger. It goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours. As per same price rahge competitors they could have given at least 25W or so.

Conclusion:-
If you are looking for a phone with best battery backup, good camera quality, best SAmoled display available in price range and a decent processor to handle day to day use with Samsung brand value.

Yash

Review
-----
sir, I  purchased the mobile with much excitement that it would provide a wonderful experience but actually the product is not worth purchasing. After using the phone for 3 to 4 weeks the system asked for an update of the software but as soon as I downloaded the update and installed it. My mobile crashed and I can do nothing on the phone. It is neither getting switched off nor restarted. So what type of help you can provide me in this regard. I will be waiting for your reply as a customer.
-----
Good Budget phone
-----
Initially, when I got the phone, I encountered the problem during startup, refer to the attached picture but after getting the technical assistance from the Amazon team, I was able to successfully launch my phone and i am not facing any problem after that.
Pros:
1. The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.
2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.
3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.
4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.

Cons:
1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.
2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.

Overall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.
-----
NOT for the people who are looking for GREAT Camera...
-----
I will be completely honest about my review after 2 days of ordinary usage...

If you are attracted to this phone because of 64MP camera then wait a minute...my iPhone 5s with 8MP takes better photos than this phone.
I don't know it's hardware or software issue. The software can be fixed with future updates.  Photos are blurry in all kinds of shots.  What is "Macro"?
I don't understand.  It takes completely unfocused blurry pics.
So if you are buying Rs.15000 phone for the camera then NO...

I won't discourage the people who want to buy it for performance. It's fabulous in that department.
6GB RAM really helps anyhow?
I don't know...I find little lag during jumping to multiple apps...
But I am satisfied with the product because Camera is not a priority for me.

Additionally I don't know how many ours should a battery last with 6000mAh with moderate use but for me it lasts for 24hr on average without gaming.

Fingerprint: 4/5
Battery: 4/5
Camera: 1/5
Performance: 3/5

Overall: 3/5.
-----
Only attraction is quad camera!
-----
The mobile is a typical Samsung phone nothing special. The only attraction is quad camera and that too is not good, picture quality is like 8 MP camera. I exchanged my Vivo V9 with it and now i'm regretting it. Vivo V9 was far better than M31. If you are going by smart look and quad camera than i am sure this phone will disappoint you.
-----
Samsung Galaxy M31 demerit
-----
This mobile has 6000mah battery but it last only one day.camera is not so good according to it megapixels.fingerprint some times not working but almost good.display and touch is good. The major problem is it's hanging. I am using this phone for last 45 days and it hangs 3 to 4 times and it takes 5 to 10 minutes and some times more to start working after hanging.i have Faith on Samsung but this hanging problem annoying me badly.Samsung needs to improve this issues.All other things are good.
-----
Samsung M31: My usage experience is awesome!
-----
Overall  nice mobile! But charging speed is little bit slow minimum it requires 3 hrs for full charge from 0 to 100% . Except that I can't even find out any issues! No heating problems unlike other mobiles . mobile case is not provided  by Samsung . Camera quality is awesome. Fingerprint sensor speed and  recognition is fine. Minimum 1.5 day you can use this mobile with out any worries about charging even heavy usage. Overall One of the best mobile from Samsung in this price range. So surely I will  recommend this mobile to my friends.
-----
Battery life is very poor.
-----
Battery is very poor. It is draining at a rate of 6% per hour. I didn't expect such a poor product from samsung. Moreover, while charging for even half n hour phone heated up. It restarted by it's own after following troubleshoot procedure also.

BEST BUDGET PHONE TILL NOW
-----
Pros--

1. SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY
  Yes the main purpose to purchase this phone is the display experience if u love to watch YouTube, Movies, Songs, etc. don't think just go for it. The sAMOLED display quality feels you premium which cannot provide by other brands in this price range. Samsung sAMOLED  is excellent compare to other brands sAMOLED.(I.e. realme, etc.)

2. 64MP QUAD CAMERA, 32MP FRONT
  CAMERA
  Camera quality is awesome. It is improved compare to M30s 48mp triple rear, 16mp front camera and gives u more details while clicking pics. But when taking low light photos it performs average, sometimes details are missing and gives u blur photos.

Note: Price is 15k not expect too much because other brands also lack in low light photos in this price range.

3. 6000mah BATTERY
  Battery backup is pretty good because sAMOLED display consumes less battery compare to (IPS)LCD, TFT display. It gives u 1.5 days battery backup which cannot given by 4000mah, 5000mah.

4. ONE UI, 6GB RAM
  Samsung one ui gives u time to time updates at least 2 yrs and above. It feels u cool compare to miui, realme mi etc. 6gb ram in this price range is just awesome because samsung A series will not provide this in 15k.

Cons--

1. EXYNOS 9611 OCTA CORE PROCESSOR
  Samsung M30s is also come with this processor. Samsung should also upgrade the processor and give at least Qualcomm sd675 or above this time. Exynos 9611 is gud for daily purpose but if u are heavy gamer then it feels u bad. This processor is now outdated this time. Performance of exynos 9611 is similar to sd660 and sd665 which is below than sd675.

2. MISSING NFC, SAMSUNG PAY, KNOX
  SECURITY
  A series provide these features but M series will not which is very disappointed for samsung user. Knox Security is samsung selfmade manufactured feature that's why it should also come in M series.

3. BUILD QUALITY
  Back side build quality is just plastic so u have to use gud back cover to avoid scratches and any other harm. A series Build quality feels u premium that's why M series are cheaper compare to A series.

4. 15 WATT CHARGER
  It has massive battery 6000mah but 15 w charger is not sufficient, it takes 2.45hrs to charge the phone 0 to 100%.Samsung should upgrade this and can give atleast 27watt charger this time.

Note-

1.Samsung always try to save money and this time they also achieve this by these all 4 cons. But in my opinion it is best package in 15k because A series are very expensive if we purchasing for these features.

2. If compare to other Chinese brands samsung phones are durable for long term uses and provide many service centers everywhere to resolve issues.
-----
Gimmicky battery. 6000mAh is just nonsense, feels like 3000mAh
-----
I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks and the battery feels like 3000mAh at best.

I have used 5000mAh phones from Asus and Panasonic before and those phone easily gave 1.5 to 2 days usage. With the advertised capacity and with a below average processor this should last longer.

I am an average user mostly on WiFi and rarely uses mobile data. Very difficult to use it on second day without charging.

Charges very slowly and discharges fast. It should have been the other way around.

Performance is average. Try to stay away from Exynos processors if you want a reasonably fast phone. But I knew this before buying, so no complaints here

Camera seems decent, but I rarely takes photos and don't think I have enough knowledge to comment on the camera quality
-----
Fake phone. 32Mp camera. 6000MAH battery. Faulty product
-----
Very bad product. There are so many issue.
1. Heating during using the phone. Like camera phone calls in 2-5 mins.
2. Poor front camera quality. Like 8 MP camera.
3. Sound is also not good.
4. Taking more than 3 hours to charge full. And 6000mah batter is giving one day backup.full fake.
Totally fake phone by Samsung. Requesting Amazon to don't sell this kind of fake phone. Samsung  are fooling the amezon customer.
Don't buy.
-----
Think twice
-----
Consider Other choices also.

Quality 6.4 AMOLED Display in FHD, that is  very comfortable to hold inspite of the mega battery that lasts more than a full day with really heavy usage.

Screen on time is easily 13-14 hrs after a full charge ,that takes around 2.5 hrs. So no more worries.

Touch sensitivity is very good.speaker volume ,call volume, reception are all adequate.Core UI 2 performs well with android 10 out of box and prompt me to update to latest patch on initial setup.No visible lag in daily use with DDR4 ram and UFS 2.1 memory. Finger print reader is snappy with no delay. Gamers may not find the same level of performance in exynos processor as a snapdragon .

Camera performance is good in the daylight.Night mode not good with little enhancements.Wide lens is OK,macro shots are average.Camera software has lot of options to explore. Video recording comes with EIS.selfie also poor.

Build quality is not OK considering the plastic back while competitors are offering gorilla glass panel.
No notification LED.
Network signal is very poor compared to my old lenova.Think twice before buying since only replacement is offered by Amazon.
-----
M31 Feedback
-----
Everything is okey except below:

1) Camera is getting blurry when you fully zoom for long distance images. It should not happen if its 64MP and one of its USP
2) Speaker volume is very Low
3) Can not split display while you are already on another app
4) Can not connect internet through WPS
5) Poor in facelock sensor
6) Palm swipe to capture screen shot is not working always.. It should be 100% accurate then only it works..

Rest all superb with this price
-----
Money Best Spend.
-----
I have been using this phone for a while now ... And in lockdown situation this phone has given me good support.

Fingerprint reader works fine and is located at back. But i am using the face recognition. I feel its better . I tried using my photos to unlock the phone .... No luck ... Works only with my face...

Camera quality is good .... From a layman's perspective these are gr8 . From a photographer perspective they are just good. Depth camera gives good bokeh...
Macro camera is good

Battery Life is just amazing ... I use this with all office communication apps and still get more than 2 days out of it ... Seriously i am just way toooo happy with it.

Not happy with below:

Phone is a little heavy because of monster battery
Knox is replaced with McAfee

I even tried some games like pubg and call of duty ... Seem to work fine for me ... So overall a monster (excellent) Phone
-----
Best Phone For Daily Use ...!!
-----
64MP Camera Is Just Gimmick Guys .. Buy This Phone Only For Battery And Display .. Overall 5star Feedback From My Side .. Because My Need Was Only Battery And Display .. I Don't Play Games So I Cant Tell U About The Gaming Performance But Camera Not Good .. But Overall For Daily Use This Phone Is Beast For Me...!!
-----
Amazing battery
-----
It is a very good product battery life is good it lasts two days camera is amazing it is very clear the ultra wide lens in awesome front camera is also good the fingerprint sensor is very good it is fast also and face unlock is also good game booster is anazing the games are very smooth the system does not have any bugs but inside the you usually get a transparent case but this doesn't have it and the screen guard also the system is really smooth and android 10 is also amazing this phone does not heat up like other phones and its display is amazing its sound quality is also good you can dolby with bt headset and with earphones i say it is  very good
-----
An excellent purchase for the price offered
-----
Samsung rolled out a beauty in the under 20k price range in m31. A completely all round phone which feels good in hand and runs smooth
Battery: 5/5 6000mah, what else do you expect
Screen: 6/5 SAmoled has my heart and soul and I dare you to find a better screen.
Design: 3.5 A little too thick but I guess it's compromisable given the battery is huge. Also the body could be metal or glass but since looks are subjective this phone looks pretty decent
Camera: 4.5/5 A beautiful camera system which works like a charm in daylight as well as night. To some the pictures may appear grainy but that's because of the resolution and efficiency of the screen itself. -.5 due to the limitations on the 64mp cam
Processor:4/5 Exynos run systems never compare to their Snapdragon equivalents but 9611 is pretty decent. After playing high Res games I couldn't see any lags or issues so in conclusion it's not as bad as it is made to sound.
OS: 4/5 the new OS by Samsung is definitely an improvement from their last few versions. But they definitely aren't stock android. Some preinstalled apps are definitely a pain but uninstalling takes matter of seconds. Plus Samsung's security system is A+ and keeps your device safe and also allows data transfer for faster recovery.

Brownie points for having a designated audio jack instead of the type c and also a designated fingerprint sensor over the in screen fingerprint sensor which are always slower.

The phone leaves barely anything to be asked except for maybe an ir blaster, although it may or may not be required by many it does come in handy at times.

Overall: 4.5/5 it's a two horse race for the under 20k segment between Samsungand realme. If you want a phone for general use and a battery powerhouse Samsung m31 seems to be the one.

Delivered previously used phone

The product was a previously used one. This is shocking,  I've bought iPhone, iPads,  Macbook and HP laptops plus others thousands from Amazon and didn't expect this. Really disappointing.

Samsung never fails!
-----
I wish I could give 6 stars to the battery life... Just amazing. I'm not a very heavy user so i get about 2 days backup. I switched on to power saver at 30% once and got one full day extra, can't imagine how long would it last on ultra power saver.

The camera is really good and beautifully captures all colours.

The screen is flawless. Amoleds, as you'd expect!

The fingerprint is a bit slow sometimes but is quick to unlock. The responsiveness decreases for a short time if you've just turned the phone on.

The software is awesome. The out-of-the-box software is a bit unstable but a recent update fixed it. Clean and shiny interface but with a few apps preinstalled, which can be uninstalled.

I don't play much games but I played CoD and what a gameplay it gives... Smooth as butter. Overheats if you play for long although performance decrease is not too much.

Thanks!

M31 mega monster review after 4 days use
-----
Not bad (go for m30s If you are short of money as the quality features are same on both the phone)
-----
The above stars are only for battery, AI features and camera.

CONS :
1) SLIGHT HEATING ISSUE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND AS WELL IN THE BACK

2) WIDE ANGLE CAMERA IS NOT CLEAN IF YOU TRY TO ZOOM IN AT ANY PARTICULAR OBJECT

4) POSITION OF SPEAKER IS POOR AS IT GETS BLOCKED WITH FINGERS WHILE PLAYING GAMES OR TEXTING . THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DUAL SPEAKER.

3) NO HEADPHONE AND COVER INSIDE THE BOX

4)GIVEN 6000MAH BATTERY , IT WILL LAST ONLY 1/2 HALF DAYS , WHICH IS OK COMPARED TO OTHER MOBILES

5) 15W CHARGER TAKES 2:30 hrs TO COMPLETE 100%, WHERE AS IF YOU CHARGE THEM THROUGH Mi POWER BANK WITH 18W SPEED IT COMPLETES BIT QUICKER.

6) BIT SLIPPERY IN CORNERS COZ OF WHICH FINDING DIFFICULT TO PLAY GAMES. HOWEVER CASE CAN ELIMINATE THIS ISSUE

7) POOR NIGHT VISION CAMERA.

8) FINGER PRINT UNLOCKER  AS USUAL POOR IN SAMSUNG

PROS:

- FRONT AND BACK CAMERA ARE AWESOME UNDER LIGHTING.

- LASTS 1 AND HALF DAYS OF BATTERY IN EXTREME USE.

-GAMING AND SOME AI FEATURES ARE GOOD.

Obviously it's a  mega monster ü§©
-----
It's a  mega monster  at this price segment ü§ñ I'll tell you the pros and cons
Pros :
‚û°Ô∏èSuper amoled display was so cool, you can't  find this kind of display on this price segment on another brand's....
‚û°Ô∏è Camera is also so cool, I can't say it's a crystal clear  cam, but it's so cool on this price segment...
‚û°Ô∏è It's too handy as well, with curvy edges  it's fit your hand so cool, you won't even feel it's 191 grams weigh....
‚û°Ô∏èExynos 9611 (10nm) Chipset is good to  play high graphics games too....Games like pubg starts with high quality graphics on default,  Almost it's equal to Snapdragon 712 Chipset...
‚û°Ô∏è It's doesn't matter that you are a heavy user,the 6000 mah will easily make it a day easily without any issues...
‚û°Ô∏è Ear piece is good as well, no issues on receiving sounds...

‚ö†Ô∏èCons...

‚û°Ô∏è  Macro cam mode is not that good as we expected....
‚û°Ô∏è As so far, I can't find any more issues....

Hope it'll help :)

Glass not good and fast charging  not working after reset phone
-----
Gorilla glass 3
Its very worst fregile product. Fall ones and broken glass.

I have Samsung Galaxy m31 i buy before 2 months.  But till i full reset my phone after that my fast charging  not working. I used already  another charger and cable  but its not workin also. I used power off mode also but it's not working.  So friends  there is no support to how to do use fast charging.  Please don't buy Samsung M series. Thank You
-----
Truly a Megagalaxy of Samsung universe.
-----
Thanks for the Samsung( really I'm in song with it) for an all in one mobile set at an effective price. Till date,I am not a big fan of Samsung, as they produced mobiles at a bit expensive rate in comparison to other companies producing the same features at a lower price, but with this product, they completely got above everyone. Have been using it from past 3 days, the mobile amazed me with its battery backup, the camera was too good. While watching videos, it was a colorful and bright experience. I haven't experienced any pause while using applications till now. The finger print sensor is very fast in response. Over all to sum it up, it was a pretty good buy at this price. I suggest fellow buyers to go with 128gb rather than 64gb, as you are getting it, just for an extra 1000.

Performance  is slow. Don't buy (Very poor.. ghost touching problem)
-----
Initial review
Performance  of the phone is slow for normal day to day activities.  You can lag in opening  apps like outlook, gmail and any other  day to day apps. Some items you can see lag in animation. I have changed setting to use less animation after that also seeing  the performance lags. No worth for amount.  The reason for performance  is Samsung uses their own processor  which slow.

After one week of usage
if the phone batter down to 20%, then phone will go to completely not usable state. Finally i put charge and re-started the phone to make it work.

Camera is good. Battery stands for 1.5 days for normal usage. Worst performance phone for day of day use.

Finally, here is the root of the problem. This mobile has ghost touching problem. Totally useless now.
-----
Average/good
-----
Good phone in mid range. Though the plastic back takes away the premium feel of using samsung brand. Function wise it's good. But looks wise the company could do better using glass or metal.

Cons: no proper cover available. Couldn't find any till date. Help me if someone has recommendations.:(

Review of SAMSUNG M31 after using it for 4 days..
-----
I am writing this review after using this phone for 4day.
This is a best budget phone in the range of 15000 as whatever u want  all the things are inside this phone, if u compare this phone  With One plus 7T  Then in camera and battery backup  this phone get a Superb value. I think in this price no any phone has battery backup of 6000mah.. and really its battery is outstanding. Same thing with its main camera I.es 64 mega pixel. A Superb camera quality .. It has failed ONe plus 7t phone camera .. so best phone in this much price.
I want to explain it's some feature as below
1stly Battery 5star
2ndly camera 64mega pixel - 5star , There is a slow motion vedio making function enabled in the camera , which is really good.
3rd Front camera - 4star.
4th Processor - 4star
5th RAM - 5star I.es 6GB ram is best for Heavy application.
6th Touches - As samsung is famous for its smooth touch so - 5star. Really awesome touch
7th - Dark mode and blue light filter are also included - 4star
These all ratings are out of 5.
Now REMEDIES / DRAWBACK of this phone is
1st - It has non metal bodies, so u can't use it rough and tough .
2ndly - little bit Heating problem during the charging of phone, and using heavy memory game, or any any Heavy software.
3rd - it's back side camera is little bit outside , so there is a maximum chance of scratch.
4th - heavy weighted phone. Phone should be slim , but it is not a slim phone, it has much high thickness.
Overall , If  someone  want to buy A phone @15000, And also  He/she is  interested in photography , and need a long more battery backup then One's should must go to this phone. But if someone  want a rough n tough phone . Then he/ she  may avoid ,  as it is a non metallic body shaped phone.. And heating problem of the phone cause a huge effects..

Not very impressive...just average product
-----
Not a impressive phone....üòèüòè
It's  just average  product .....
I was using Lenovo k8 plus, just bought for 8k before 2 years...its working better than galaxy m31..
Dolby atmos is not working at all in galaxy m31....
I bought galaxy m31 after seeing YouTube reviews..... now only I found that they all are paid reviews...üòåüòåüôÑüôÑüôÑ

If you want a complete phone, please  choose any another brand like redmi, realme or something else

I am not satisfied with this phone...

If you have any questions,  please ask me...my cell number 8489558489

M31 is a Monster !! Best phone in 15K wd 64mp quad camera, amoled full hd disp,6k mh battery,6gb ram
-----
Iam always been big fan of samsung display and camera and ever since I had used them I haven't thought ant going 4 other chinese brands with cheap LCD display on which u can neither appreciate a good pic nor game or enjoy movies on it!!

6.4" Full hd Amoled screen + 64 mp/32 mp camera + 6000 mah battery wd fast charging was too much to ignore even when MI &amp; realme were giving very competent specs at lower price but it's lcd display &amp; camera was not 4 me hence I went for M31  and it outperformed my expectations!!
From phone display to camera quality to battery life to processor it was just perfect for me in 15K..

I wud hv appreciated a gradient glossy panel but ocean blue color is actually very beautiful and shiny and phone doesn't feel heavy at all!!
Battery is huge and for full charging it does take time but it can easily last a day on 50‚ÑÖ charge for normal usage so iam not worried abt battery life and 15w charger  !!

6 GB ram is the most impressive feature of this phone,thank u samsung.

64 MP rear camera and 32 mp front were treat to click , u don't need any 3rd party app to adjust/beautify ur clicks such gr8 has been camera quality of M31!!

Slow motion recording both front and back was the feature I was looking forward to and I loved it!!

Iam not a heavy gamer but this phone can play pubg ,asphalt, mortal kombat and other heavy games wd ease!!

Finger print reader works well this time in samsung M31 !

Few tips and tricks:

By def front camera is 21 MP in order to select 32 MP option select wide-angle option and then select 3:4 full option and u will see camera size 32 mp.

For rear camera 64 mp option is available in options u hv to just look into it

Slow motion is available in both front and back camera but super slow motion is available in rear camera only! Loved that feature!

Only downside I found was knox security not present but u can always install a good antivirus to keep ur m31 safe!!
McAfee is there anyway to keep u safe!!

No complaints only praise for this beautiful and affordable monster, if ur planning to upgrade ur fone wd impressive quad camera , beautiful display and huge battery M31 will not disappoint u, it is d best phone in terms of camera, battery, display and with 6gb ram and xynos latest processor it can easily do multitasking and gaming wd ease.. I loved it,it works like a charm

Things to consider before purchasing M31
-----
So, you decided to purchase the M31, based on its ratings and reviews? Then you must think about the following facts if you want to buy it:

1. If you have more money, go for a higher priced phone like A70s. This phone has the features of other phones which are in the price bracket of 18k-22k.

2. The battery backup is very good, my phone lasts 3 days on a single charge, with WiFi on all day, 2-3 hours of browsing throughout the day and moderate calling of 1-2 hours per day. However, if you want to exploit the phone by playing games all day long, you have to charge the phone everyday. Games run smooth, but this is not a gaming phone. You should target something in the price bracket of 35k+ for that purpose.

3. Phone is sturdy and looks great. Drop it from a height of 2 feet and it will be okay. Spray water on it, and still it will be ok.

4. Camera is really good for normal photography including slow mo, fast shutter speed, good colour reproduction, and daytime photography. Night time photography is decent, but don't expect it to perform like a 50k phone. It will produce photos like a 20k phone should.

5. Charging time is around 2.5 hours if you are on 0% charge. But it charges very fast to 85%. So, if you start charging it from 40%, it will take around 30-45 minutes to get fully charged.

6. Phone does not get hot under any circumstances, does not hand, does not restart.

7. Phone display is very bright, even in bright sunlight.

8. Phone UI is good, with some bloatware like NETFLIX.

9. Headphone is not given with phone.
-----
Excellent
-----
Excellent product. Worth buying it.

Pros:
Massive 6k battery. Goes on and on.
4 rear cameras with the main one at 64mp.
Excellent front cam.
Blue color looks stunning.
S amoled screen with always on display.
Finger print and face unlock work superb.
Android 10.

Cons:
Limited bloatware, Samsung apps, which can be disabled at least which is good.
Back panel absorbs fingerprints easily. Needs frequent cleaning.
Doesn't come with an earphone. You can buy one outside per your choice.

Suggestions:
Buy a back case and tempered glass for extra safety, though it has gorilla glass.

6+128 is priced 1k extra. I think 6+64 is quite enough and you can buy another 64gb memory card within 650-700 rs, so saving a little and increasing more data mobility.

Never look at M30 or M30s. You get M31 for the same price with much better camera.

Competitive Mega Monster
-----
A complete mega Monster.  This phone brings back Samsung in competition with the Chinese brands which has captured the market share in recent years.

Before writing this review, let me tell you'll a short brief on my requirements and background. I'm middleaged,  working professional from Mumbai and my requirements were basic usage with some multimedia at the EOD. And I'm not a gamer. This is my 3rd mobile in 4 years and prior to this,  I've been using A popular known brand and model,  Redmi Note 4 since 2017 and another from upcoming company Realme with it's launch model Realme1 since Jun 2018. And my very first Android phone was none other than Samsung Galaxy M (CDMA model) So my experience and expectations were coming from the usage of these 2 recent handsets.
I wanted a mobile which gives me a smooth touch experience (lagging in Realme 1) with a decent performance with best battery (lagging in RN4) and a large storage within a budget of 15k.
This mobile may not be the best for full time gamers however it can definitely help you get a good 2 days battery life (with all day usage with bluetooth connected) with a smooth and vibrant looking display with its super amoled screen and knocking performance for all day to day needs including some gaming.  And I'm completely satisfied with Samsung Galaxy M31 for this. With its new OneUI 2.0, I'm completely amazed with the kind of adaptations Samsung has done from its earlier Galaxy series.

I use to always feel, Samsung is am expensive brand and it always offer less against what we pay, however, must say, Samsung changed my perception towards Samsung mobiles. If your planning to upgrade for a smooth all around performance with a huge battery and a sexy display with a budget around 15-16k, go for it and you will love owing it...

Awesome phone...Beast for a reason . Thank you samsung

after 6 days of use:
Camera 5/5
Performance 5/5
Display 5/5
Battery 5/5
Phone look 5/5
User interface 5/5
Sound 5/5
awesome phone
Pros:
1. It looks stunning with the AMOLED display and looks like a high-end category phone.
2. The battery is so powerful. literally a mini power bank. once fully charged it lasts for more than 2 days with heavy usage .
3. Fast charging. and the phone is very handy with lightweight. never expected the phone to be this much light with a huge 6000 Miah battery.
4. The camera is awesome. didn't expect a good camera and a mini power bank at this price range. wide-angle shots are as awesome as high-end phones.
5 , Touch Response  ‚Äì Fast, precise, with low latency. Particularly noticeable on the keyboard, quick toggle menu, as well as when knocking off notifications or deleting feeds on say, the Chrome browser. Faster animations further this experience.
6, Good call quality and Cellular Reception.
 value for money at this price .
-----
Very happy
-----
Everything is better than expected. Just one thing can't resolve: JioCall app doesn't work. Though jio internet works, calls also are ok. Only app itself is not ok. I tried to check sim setting, mobile data settings, to restart the phone, everything - but nothing helps. Maybe there's no need of this app actually as soon as everything works without so it's ok.

High Value For Money
-----
This phone is the best phone which we can buy currently especially when this is coming from a brand like Samsung

1. The first thing is the screen which is very crisp and clear. Love watching movies on it.

2. The processor is fast and one of the best in this price range.

3. The battery which is 6000 mah even with a heavy phone usage will easily last you through the day and even more.

4. The finger print reader works well.

5. The camera is really good with great output all around.

All in all, it ticks all the right boxes and you are guaranteed to enjoy this phone. A very easy recommendation for all.

Overall satisfied..
-----
Awesome phone..I am writing  this review after using  the phone after more than 1 month. Both rear  and front camera is awesome  and quality of picture is good..it suport 4K videos..I am bit disappointed  on battery quality and charging ponit..It is not up to the mark on 6000mAh battery..It takes 3-4 hr to charge the full battery  and discharge within a day.If you will play game,it will discharge withi  10 hr.I am not playing games much,so I am satified but I won't support to buy this phone if you paly games all most of the time in a day.Also I am not happpy  on face recognition..I feel as It doesn't  support sometime..But overall it is a good phone.

Megamobile
-----
Im writing this review after using it 20 days.

 I have received my phone on 8th March ,ordered on 5th march when the sell has started.
when I took this in my hand ,feel very light weight if comparision to 6000mah mega battery, I watched a movie of 2hour and 5 mins and it consumed only 20% battery ,battery life is very great ,it runs approx 1 to 1and half day after full charge. Charging time is approx 140 minutes.

Its camera quality is outstanding , night mode is also hats off, macro camera is so pretty if compare to other brands,It is completely one handed phone. so many features are available in this phone.
It has a very very very smooth processor. Now if talking about display that what a display is it. M31 has Curved display like which is given on samsung S8, S9 OR S10. It feels like premium display, Dark mode is outstanding..I always use dark mode.
Rear fingerprint is also working properly. It has a great quad camera set up. Worth for money...

Excellent Mobile at excellent price !!! Don't miss
-----
Best Mobile for this price. Camera is par at the best. Both the front and rear cameras are excellent and the result is very detailed and very minute, previously was using Vivo V9 that to bought at Amazon. Low light photography is ok. Touch is excellent. Battery back up is also very good. Processing is very good without any lagging and no heating issues even at very very long usage, almost day long. Stylish and the curved edge screen is excellent
-----
Suuuuuper se uuuupar
-----
This phone has more than everything I expected. My favorite is this Super AMOLED screen just üòò.

Pros-
superb battery. 1- 1.5 day
Camera (Rear camera is on other level) + AR Emoji
6 GB Ram (more than my laptop)
Very nice call quality (I uses Airtel)
Finger print sensor is fast.
Selfie is better in natural lighting
Dedicated Memory card slot.
Charging speed is not that slow.
Feels very nice in hand and can be easily hold in one hand.

Cons-
Face unlock is slowww and few times didn't worked.
Can't uninstall Netflix, Facebook and few other Samsung's app but these can be disabled.
Got around 50 GB out of 64 GB.
No back cover provided in box.
Finger prints are all over the back.

Verdict

Best phone to buy around this budget. Super value for money. I am very happy to have this phone.
Don't think just buy it. You won't regret.
-----
Perfect, Value-for-money, elegant and unique.
-----
Samsung Galaxy M31 is the Perfect package out there. The Mega 6000mah battery easily gives me 2 days of battery backup. The 64mp camera gives amazing details in the photos. And the best part is, you can also take macro shots, not just with the macro lens, but with the help of 64MP camera too.
I was looking for few of things from my new phone. I wanted a great camera, great battery backup, unique and elegant looking design on the back of the phone. Samsung Galaxy M31 provides all of it. Plus a Super-AMOLED display. Samsung is THE best display manufacturer out there. The exynos chipset is no less than any other chipset in the market.
This phone has made me decide that my future phones will be of Samsung.
-----
Problem
-----
I have a Samsung M31
SYMPTOMS

a) all videos regardless of the application used are playing on fastforward with no sound. This happens on all apps incl youtube, netflix, amazon prime, including videos I have been sent via WhatsApp. b) there is no sound on the phone at all - nothing when I play music, it doesn't ring when someone calls me, and even though i can pick up the call, I can't hear the other person's voice and they cant hear mine

 ATTEMPTED FIXES THAT DID NOT WORK
1. Restart multiple times
2. Reset app preferences
3. Play with Dolby settings (restore to default, turn off/on)
4. Wipe cache preferences using volume up/down buttons then rebooting
5. Adjusting all the volume settings to make sure nothing was muted
6. Turn phone on on safe mode to ensure it wasnt the apps that were buggy (and played a video I had stored on my phone but same issue)
-----
Samsung is new lub
-----
Very Good Features. You just can't compare with 2 yrs back Samsung mid range smartphones.  they were really not value for money. but now situation is different.  the screen is really superb. everything is good except face lock. and the best part is it's a very trustable brand. nowadays privacy is the biggest concern and after hearing about the Xiaomi's case i am not gonna trust any chinese brand. i have poco f1 too but now the situation is different and i will not trust any chinese brand again.
-----
Rethink before buying this phone specially online
-----
Guys don't become a fool and buy this phone
The phone will start hanging and will switch off in between a call. Touch will not work , you have to end up pressing the touch multiple times to accept end calls or to do any work on phone.
Battery life is ok ok
Phones started hanging in just 2 days
And more painful is that Amazon does not have return policy for this. They will send some technician to check it and "if " he finds issue phone will be replaced.
If I would have known this I would never have purchased it from here.
Now only god knows how my problem will be solved. I have came across such issue 1st time ever as I always preferred to buy such electronic items from physical store or not to go for any random low budget phone to avoid any complexity.

Rethink before buying this phone from amazon ( if u faced any difficulty they won't return or refund the amount)

heating issues on the upper part and defect issue
-----
I purchased a samsung M31 on 11 th mar 2020 ,it had heating issues on the upper part of the screen,I have talked to the  customer care regarding this issue,,they told download blancco app,but it is not working properly,I cannot get my money  ,waste of product ,do not buy again ,very disappointed  this kind of experience,mobile inspection  service technician did not came as per confirmation  customer  care,
-----
Decent phone, value for money.
-----
After using an iphone this phone feels quite low in performance. The screen resolution is not sharp, the camera has filters but images are not sharp. A bit slow response to certain apps.
Otherwise good with fingerprint response, battery life is amazing overall for the price it's good for general use.
-----
Dont buy battery heating issues
-----
Pros, light weight and cameras decent

Cons, battery has serious heating issues.. i was on a long drive..  had maps and music on in the background...after 4 hrs.. the phone was heated up to a point where the apps started closing.  After 2 more hours the ph had totally heated up.. and the phone conked off.. i needed maps and had to park to the side.. anotherfunny thing was i had the car charger on even then the ph battery died.. samsung still has serious battery, heating issues.. am not impressed .

Samsung galaxy m31 stuck at Downloading...Do not turn off target.
-----
Galaxy M31 stuck at 'Downloading...Do not turn off target', ODIN MODE (AVB Fail)
SUPER: Build-id does not match with the reference
(SUPER) : 30278215R, (BOOTLOADER) : 29256088
I have tried to restart using Volume down+power button then samsung logo comes and then immediately it shows Downloading... blue screen. Tried many times but no use at all, My daily work is purely depending on this mobile but due to this problem I cannot use this mobile at all now, this will make my days too dangerous about my job during this corona lock down,  so contacted  samsungchat assistant but they suggested to visit the service center, but due corona lock down no service center available, I do not understand why should I visit the service center because it is a software problem not the hardware problem, I have tried to search the issue in Google it seems most of the Galaxy M31 mobiles facing the same issue, so I suggest samsung people should look into this issue ASAP and resolve it automatically without visiting the service centre by force update some thing.

A good alternative for Chinese brands.
-----
I was waiting for launching this phone &amp; purchased on 1st day of sale.My requirement was good camera ,display &amp; decent battery life.There was lot of alternative for this phone like poco x2,realms x2,Realme 6 &amp;pro ,Redmi Note 9( going to launch this week) since I don't want Chinese brand I not considered those.
Pros
1)Good day light photos
2)Long battery backup
3)AMOLED Display
4)Samsung UI

Cons
1)Camera clarity lacks in indoor &amp; night
2)Charging time is more because of 6000mAh battery only with 15W charger.
3)Polycarbonate body.
-----
Best all rounder in this price segment.
-----
This is hands down the best smartphone available in the market at this price range. It performs great in almost every department.
Cameras(both front and rear) are amazing. Clicks amazing detailed shots.
Battery(6000 mah) is outrageous. Lasts for a day(heavy usage) or two(normal usage) easily.
UI(one UI 2.0) is fantastic. Smooth and buttery experience.
Display(Super Amoled FHD+)is gorgeous. Viewing angles are fantastic and color reproduction is amazing.
Processor(Exynos 9611) is quite powerful. While it is not a gaming centered phone it performs above average in all high end games.
Considering to but a smartphone with the best value for money? Then this is the best pick!
-----
Android 10's mega blast!!
-----
OMG!!!
Fabulous one!
I just love this one. Samsung just has brought a best phone for us under 20k.
Since, I've been using this product, I found it better than any other phone in market. The most impressive  thing I find is it's UI, battery, camera and smooth screen(higher refresh rates). It's camera is really fabulous one. The battery of this phone do never let you down from using. It's UI is too user friendly. I found it best in every aspect. It's terrible combination of it's price and features makes me mad. Guys, I solemnly recommend you to have purchase of this product.thanks!
Hopefully, I think you find this review helpful.

Best phone under 20k
-----
One of the best satisfying phone I ever had in my life. After 7 days of use I find that the phone has a longer battery storage keeps long lasting , camera,  videos  and functions like hyperlapse,  slow motion mode,  superslowmotion mode is commendable to use. Display is big enough with curve design, looks are fantastic.  Eye catching masterpiece. Speakers are good ..faster enough..
Go for it people

M31 is good to buy
-----
Pros:
6GB RAM,64MP rear camera,32MP Front Camera,6000mah battery and more over Samsung is brand,Gorilla glass 3,Sound is good especially DOLBY ATMOS,AMOLED Display
Cons:
Some what delay in recognizing face especially in low light conditions, Back Panel build with Plastic
And remaining is good And you have to buy ear phones and case and Temper glass/Screen Protector.I am using phone since five days I didn't face any problems and more over that this phone will have some lags while playing pubg.So game lovers didn't like this phone I mean you will play up to medium level games but large exams like PUBG..etc you will face some lags.But except game lovers every common man like this phone and it fulfills all his needs.
-----
#bestbudgetphone

Now firstly for the pubg lovers I would like to tell you that it easily runs pubg at HDR ultra settings of graphics with no lag you just need to activate performance mode which obviously uses more battery give best performance.The phone has three battery modes by default it will be in performance mode ,( takes as much juice possible from your battery to handle your heavy tasks, multitasking, etc. And once you it last easily 2 days. Cameras are awesome it's a bit warmer and soft images but details are amazing and other colours.....
Guys literally there are loads of features and don't want to write an essay over here it will be tedious for you all to read....
Trust me I'm using it as my daily driver and had no issues ya it may not have 90Hzs but who needs it in day to day budget life. Don't think just go for it and you enjoy it phone ...... #bestbudgetphone...
-----
A value for money budget king....
-----
Like's
1. Ergonomic design
2. Less SAR value
3. No over heat issue
4. Battery lasts minimum 2 days &amp; max 3 days
5. AMOLED Display is awesome at its best
6. Feels light and easy to hold

Dislike's
1. Plastic build is prone to easy scratches
2. Not packed with company fitted screen protector for its price
3. No TPU back cover available with the box
4. 15 watt charger is not sufficeant to charge large 6000 mah battery fast

Over all:
A value for money smartphone with lot to like, compromises are acceptable for this price range.....Go for it without 2nd thought if your budget is strictly around 17k
-----
Phone battery is massive and its fantastic in battery backup &amp; Display is impressive.
-----
Pro:Phone Display is impressive 5 out of 5, Battery life impressive 5/5, Phone weight management excellent 5/5, Speaker output is Normal.
Cons: Front camera detailing need to improvement rating 3/5, Back Camera detailing need to improvement rating 3/5, I'm Facing Performance issue phone hang issue without any gaming (I'm just a normal user i'm not a gamer or heavy user ) during YouTube surfing , There is no option for apps lock for privacy related, Phone build quality need to improve volume up down &amp; power button very poor quality its to hard.
Suggestion: Samsung can fix most of the things with help of software update, specially camera detailing issue.

Samsung galaxy M 31 review
-----
Product is very good. This mobile phone has best battery backup. Anyone can think 6000 mah battery with 64 mp rear back camera and 32 mp front camera. The fingerprint is responding so fast. Fack lock is outstanding. Security level is very good. This mobile phone has mamy more features like- screenshot with hand. Screen display is very smooth with gorilla glass. The Samsung prosser of this phone is best for gaming. The ram is very good and rom also. This phone also produces just small amount of radiation compare to other phone. I think this mobile can beat I phone also and at last I recommend this phone to that who want  mobile phone working for 2 or 3 year. I really....... Like this phone Samsung. Your company is best for me.
-----
Awesome Device
-----
The first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31 is its design. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is good. The battery 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support, 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with an AMOLED screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels and Samsung Exynos 9611 processor, are some excellent feature of the Samsung Galaxy M31 Smartphone, which no other competitor is offering right now at this price point.
after 7 days of uses:
Phone design &amp; look - 5/5
Camera  - 5/5
Performances  -5/5
Display  - 5/5
Battery  -5/5
User interface  -5/5
Sound  -5/5
awesome phone
-----
Great display with average camera
-----
Great display for the price range and I am happy that I shifted to Samsung for this reason.
Battery life is good and lasts for almost 2 days with normal usage with WiFi, but it's not the best as it drains quickly with 4G.
Camera is decent when it's outdoor. At low light and indoors it's just an average camera. Live focus selfies and night mode(front and rear)are useless. Live focus / portrait blurs out some portion of the face which is very bad.
Call quality and speaker quality is fine.
Samsung One UI is good but it misses out some of the important features as it's M series phone.
-----
Value for money
-----
I ordered the phone on 5th March'20 and got on 8th March'20 as promised by Amazon I had been using this phone for past 3 days. Kindly find my review below.
Pros:
Amazing battery. Single charge for 2 days minimum.
Screen clarity is good. SAMOLED display
Processor speed is ok.
Played PUBG for continous 3 hours. Battery drained by 10% only.
Phone is light weight.
Wifi calling.
5G wifi support.
Loved this dark mode.
Samsung VPN.
Cons:
Heating up issues as in all Galaxy M series.
Camera quality is average.
Full charge requires 2 hrs.

Finally 15,999 for Samsung is ok to buy.

Mega Monsters review - Go for it
-----
Review after 4 days usage:

The phone is very good in terms of what it offers for 16 thousand mid range segment. Pros,cons and final verdict below.

Pros:
1. Camera is solid. Far better then any other mobiles in this segment. Live focus,slow motion and other features work perfectly. Have attached live focus,normal pick, normal video and slowmo. If you want great camera performance this is the mobile
2. Battery is wonderful, no need to tell it's a beast 6000 Mah
3. Display is crisp and very sensitive
4. Game play is also great, pubg works well in normal graphics
5. Build is also very good, not as bad as they are reviewed it's a decent build for this segment but not much smudge proof. Use back cover.

Cons:
1. Slow charging due to 15w but this is not a problem as 1 time charge will last you while day
2. Some times the apps icons on up swipe do not display, once locked and unlocked it reappears not much of an issue must be software or due to heavy graphics wall papers. Will check further and update.

Final verdict is to go for the mobile if you are keen on camera, display and battery. For game play pubg note 8 pro might perform well in graphics side but this does a decent job as well. It worth it guys, its actually a mega monster #megamonster #sansung
-----
Best Buy
-----
First of all , I would say the phone has extremely good battery life while using continuously (Gaming Netflix) it delivers upto 13-14 hrs backup

Fingerprint reader is very fast, phone gets unlocked with just a touch

Camera quality is also very good in daylight and in low light it is satisfactory

I didn't face any lag while playing PUB-G , the phone did a great job.

 I also loved the Super amoled display, it delivers a very good quality viewing experience.

Overall the phone is doing a great Job, I didn't face any problems as of now loved it :)
-----
Best in the price
-----
Complete package at the price point.
Amazing camera and great battery life. Plays games like PUBG without any issues at all, didn't feel excessive heat after half hour play either. 128 GB memory should last for everyone.
Dolby is a great addition.
-----
Great (probably the best) phone at this price range.
-----
Nice (probably the best) phone at this price range.
Here is my take (rating based on 5 stars)on the specs:
Looks and feel - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚≠ê
Processor - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê I still think Snapdragon 8** is better
Video - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Sound - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Battery life - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Charging - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Connectivity - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê video call experience is great with Vodafone 4g
Camera - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê best feature of the phone, wide angle lens is too good

Bottomline: I would definitely recommend this phone
-----
What a bang for buck, way better than other phones at this price range.
-----
Honestly didn't expect this phone to be soo good. The software animations are so fluid, the camera is crazy good and the screen is obviously best in the market coz. Its Samsung's. I'm listing some pros and cons down here, be sure to read it. Also I've posted photos shot on this phone for reference.

Pros:
‚Ä¢Samsung's one UI is way better than the competition like Redmi's crappy MIUI.
‚Ä¢The camera's are just too good, the HDR shots are amazing and the 64mp rear and 32mp front camera modes are just the cherry on top.
‚Ä¢6000 mah battery is absolute overkill for a phone at this price.
‚Ä¢The screen is really good, it's Amoled and can get pretty bright outdoors and pretty dim for indoors too.
‚Ä¢The processor is really good too, enough for any task u throw on this.
‚Ä¢Fingerprint scanner is on the back instead of in the screen thus it's faster, more reliable and better.
‚Ä¢Amazon delivered the phone in 24 hrs with exchange so it was amazing.

Cons. :
‚Ä¢No fastcharger in the box even when it supports it, so charging to 100% takes too long.
‚Ä¢In wide angle camera, there's no lens correction like in Samsung's Hughes end phones so photos look weird at the corners(I've uploaded a wide angle photo for reference).
‚Ä¢phone can get a little bit hot while gaming, but not crazy hot so it's fine.
‚Ä¢The 64mp photos are not that crisp so I just stick to normal camera mode.
-----
Worst Samsung mobile ever
-----
Please don't buy this phone. It has major heating issues. It gets drastically heated while watching videos, while taking photos, during calls and also while charging. 6000mah battery is just for name sake. It works for 1 to 1.25 days without heavy usage. Full charging takes upto 3hrs. Speaker quality is also bad.
The only good thing about this phone is camera.
-----

-----
Very hanging and slow operating
-----
No quality in camera functions, battery is like normal phones only No change in it. Fingerprints accessible is not quick, phone is getting heat while in communication or using product. While using applications phone is getting hanged.
-----
Worst phone ever bought
-----
Worst phone ever I bought. I ordered the phone in 1st day of lunch. I got timely delivery but  After using for 29 days phone got hang up while updating software. Now phone is locked for more than 2days in a screen showing AVB error . I tried to restart phone many time but still showing same . Even I let the phone to get switch off by itself after consumption of battery still showing same while charging.Now I can't return it because they say return period were till 27th march. Lockdown nation wide still on can't go to Samsung care centre. I'm giving those stars because I don't have any option for zero.I don't understand what should I do.
-----
It's handy &amp; worth considering
-----
I haven't come across such a great camera at this cost. Battery is just keep going until you get off...optimal size &amp; screen details are amazing..over all, ...fingerprint sencer at back &amp; follow your commands instantly without any glitch  ..never ending battery I experienced..using it for more than month now...it's get on well with me...screen size is nothing but perfect what I looking for &amp; the phone is much convenient in holding it ...no second thought if you desperately need a phone ...a complete package to complete a man!!!!!
-----
A very good phone at this price point
-----
Excellent phone with all the necessary specs for a fantastic deal. I bought this at 14999. At that price I needed 4 things:
a) Good processing power and RAM
b) Sufficient internal memory &amp; expansion
c) Good battery
d) Good camera

I'm very happy with the first 2. I have a 128GB card which houses all my data and hence,
64GB was more than enough for me. Battery doesn't feel like a 6000mAh. My charge runs down to 30% by the end of the day. But this might be because of extensive initial setup. This is why I'd give it less than 5 stars. Another problem is the call-speaker volume is not great.
The camera is mostly good and sufficient for candid photography. The sensor is what matters and it is good enough for this price point.
Some of the built-in features are good.
In short, I'm happy with my purchase.
-----
Cool phone
-----
I upgraded from a 4 year old samsung. So as soon as I got hands on experience with this phone, I was amazed by how smooth the experience was.

Samsung has moved onto the budget phone market and has established an elegant line of phones.

Pros:
 - The finger print sensor is fast and very responsive
 - The battery lasts a good 2 days.
 - Faster compared to other budget phones in the 15k~ range
 - The build quality is nice
 - Despite the size, it's a very light phone

Cons:
 - Battery takes 3 hours to charge completely
 - Even though it has a nice back, it is prone to fingerprints, and scratches
 - Thicker than normal
-----
Great phone
-----
The phone has amazing camera and battery. It has One of the best displays. But i am facing issues with face ID (it doesnt recognize my face sometimes) . The phones doesnt come with a cover( pls keep in mind that samsungs M30s cover will slightly cover the macro lens camera if u use it on M31.)
-----
What a phone only pubg is......
-----
I am a iphone x user I purchase this phone as secondary phone for the doing unnecessary activity to save my iPhone x battery and phone life But after 4 day i sell the phone because of pubg performance as i am addicted to play in iPhone x smooth display but if u have already a android below 10 k then this phone is best for you
1- call quality earpiece  10/10
2- speaker quality 10/10
3- Display quality 10/10 no issue
4- battery omg i used whats app and Facebook 3 days in one charge 10/10

-----
Average product, don't buy this with high expectations. Its not worthy.
-----
Phone is good. Value for money, but sound quality is not good. While playing Facebook,Youtube and other MX Player or internal video's it's not getting sound. If I restart then phone then its sounding. I'm facing oftenly but it's not resolved yet. And Wifi hotspot is not working properly while connecting to desktop or Laptop. But its connecting to mobiles. I raised for exchange phone, let's see what will happen. But I never expects this type of problems by SAMSUNG. Really upset....!!
-----
Worst mobile ever
-----
One of the worst phone ever
Don't purchase it
The phone started hanging on 2nd day of usage only for 4hours
Phone starts heating up even without using
Amazon is not taking back the phone claiming no return option
Please don't be fooled like me
Amazon it's really a worst experience I am not purchasing ever from Amazon from now

M31 after a day
-----
I got it on Saturday morning. You will get a mobile and charge. Which is OK. No phone cover, no earphone, no screen glass.
Everything is fine now coming on the battery part.
6000mh honestly??? I charged it 100 percent in the night and today in the evening It was 56 and I didn't used it a lot. But I think it is okay in this price range ... I don't play games but if you are a games lovers. You need to think it twice.
 battery part is a questionable thing.
Face lock doesn't work properly. Sometimes it recognizes your face and sometimes it doesn't
-----
Never expected from Samsung products
-----
This product is not well purchased.  As this doesn't  have Knox security, secure folder  app lock, screen recorder. As this are basic app required by any customer. More over in my set I find qr code ,screen shot , and contact list are not working. Never expected from samsung. More over Amazon doesnot allow for refund. Else I would have replaced this model
-----
PERFECT

Worse product ! Shame on Samsung
-----
This is my first Samsung mobile i ever buy and worse product I ever buy. Plz don't be mislead by 64mp quad cameras and 6000amh battery. Fast charging literally doesn't work it took almost 2hours to get 100% charge with 15w charger . Front camera is worse camera but with update it get little better. we can't turn on flast while wide angle photo It is not even week since I bought , suddenly screen touch stop working , can't restart or do anything on it . Lying useless at moment . Shame on you Samsung .
-----
Perfect phone for your parents
-----
I purchased this device on the very first day of it release, I purchased it for my Dad as he wanted a device which is simple enough to use with enough battery for everyday use and good camera to take pictures.
He is not a gamer nor he is a power user , thus looking at the criteria which he needed this phone was making all right ticks .
My dad is extremely happy with his purchase although when I have used the phone to just see how it is , I feel there are some software issues for example sometimes he says face unlock works sometimes it doesn't , which I believe is just a simple software fix .
-----
A wounderful phone to meet my purse
-----
On the next day of release i.e 6.3.2020 ,  I purchased Samsung M31 , as I was very impressed with M20.Samsung the " master in creating mobiles " in the intrest of public and to their taste.
  My order was honoured and sent the phone within 3days.Now Iam enjoying the great phone suitable to my purse.
No heating in playing and recording videos.Thrillig sound output ..What more I need..I recommend to my friends to own a beautiful phone..

Power House with Awesome Display
-----
Pros and Cons compare to other mobiles in the same budget

Pros.
1. Awesome Display
2. Battery Excellent
3. Build quality is OK
4. Camera (both front and back) is good ( not comparing with flagship mobile cams )
5. Speaker sound quality is decent
6. One UI is OK but it could have been better
7. Processor is good and with 6GB RAM it's performance is smooth

Cons.
1. No back cover out of the box.
2. 15w charger is enough for 6000mah battery
3. Camera (both front and back) in low light is not up to the mark
4. There are few issue with software for example, sometimes unable to send SMS, Samsung customer took remote access but unable to find reason.
hope these software issues will be fixed soon with future updates

Over all - it is a value for money.
-----
Good with some serious trouble
-----
Good phone but BEWARE....
(1) The front facing does not look like it's 32 MP.
(2)The BATTERY is NOT NOT NOT good. It drains off in 12 hrs flat heavy use. But even if you use it with ease it doesnt seem to stretch to 24 hrs.
SAMSUNG's claims seem to be not correct about battery.
-----
Decent phone for the price.
-----
The camera and display are excellent.  I am absolutely fine using a regular fingerprint reader , as midrange indisplay fingerprint reader sucks in midrange samsung phones.
Battery life is decent,  you csn leave a lot of things turned on.
The phone takes a lot of time to boot up , not sure why.
Charging is pretty slow compared  other quick charging Samsung phones.
-----
More than value for money.
-----
I was a Samsung C9pro user for past 3 years , the migration to M31 was pretty easy with smart switch, other than few credit card apps none of the  other apps recognise the move, face unlock it works and it doesn't, phone battery stays for one and half day with dual SIM,  figner print scanner improved a lot, camera is also better with correct light, phone casting to TV is not crashing , however  photo quality when we view on a 4k TV is not great, android auto also much stable, Bluetooth connectivity with both smart watch and car works seamlessly.

Awesome smartphone
-----
The best ever decision qas to purchase this budget Smart phone with extraordinary battery capacity.
I have never expected the amazing Performance of Samsung phones of this price range.
The performance of this phone is ultimate matching near to its S series phones.
Battery is awesome...its range for me is 18hrs in one charge.
Camera performance is out standing.
Fingerprint is instant.
Overall best offer by Samsung.
Thanks to Samsung for launching such a wonderful budget Smart phone.
-----
Best option in lower mid range phones
-----
After a months use I will highly recommend this phone to all heavy users. The camera and battery are two of the best pros to buy this mega monster. Screen is awesome and clearly visible in bright sunlight. One very important benefit is that when you connect the phone to computer for taking photos or files from your phone, its very easy to find the files or photos from phone memory, whereas its a nightmare to find your data on most of the Chinese brands. Its the best option out there, so dont try any other Chinese phones but buy Samsung Galaxy M31.

Best Mobile From Samsung
-----
Best Mobile from Samsung I Purchased on First Sale from Amazon, In Just Rs:16000/ You get A Samsung Mobile with 128 GB of Internal Storage, 6GB RAM &amp; 6.4 Inch Super Amoled Screen.
Best part of it Mega Moster 6000 Mah Battery first from any Mobile Co.
You can buy this Mobile without second thaught. I m enjoying 3 day of Battery life on moderate use.
Thank Brand Samsung n Amazon quickly delivered to me within 12 hours.
-----
Go for it.
-----
Giving review after Using it for two days.  Recieved the phone with 49% charge and it lasted over 7 hours with continuous use. So yes the battery is massive.

Here are some pros, some average features and some cons I experienced in two days of rigorous usage.

Pros-

1. Superrrrr Battery-  Today I charged my phone to 100% and it's been more than 4 hours of continuous use and the battery is still 75%. The Monster battery of 6000mah Is by far the USP of Galaxy M31 and the reason why I bought this smartphone.

2. The Stunning and beautiful super Amoled Display- OMG I can't emphasize on how gorgeous the display is. After watching on this super amoled screen, every other display of laptop, TV, other phones look out dated.

3. One UI 2.0 - the UI of M31 is amazing. It is simple yet so satisfying. This is hands down the best UI in any smartphone.

Average features-
1. Gaming - I'm not a heavy or pro gamer but played pubg and Gareena free fire for a little while for testing. The games do take a little while to open thanks to dated exynos 9611 but there's no significant lag while playing and average players will have no issue playing Games in this smartphone. Not to mention the super amoled screen makes graphics look stunning.

2. Camera-  Both front and back camera in this smartphone are good but not 64mp or 32mp good. However The quality is amazing considering the Samsung brand name and budget price tag. On a positive note HD videos can be made in this smartphone so you can stop taking your DSLR everywhere.

3. Also has Dolby atmos feature. I did use it while using YT music but found no difference. Maybe it requires better quality headphones to experience or is just useless.

4. The phone does look good but fails to give premium look. Back panel is plastic instead of glass something redmi note 8 has. However I always use cover so not an issue for me.

5. 6 GB RAM - the Ram is 6 GB yet only 3 gb is ever free. Rest of the 3 gb is gobbled up by the heavy OS and bloatware.

6. McAfee antivirus - McAfee antivirus is preloaded but I have annual subscription of Avast ultimate so kind of useless to me.

Cons-
1. No cover provided within the box.
2. No headphones provided.
3. No Samsung secure folder.
4. Fingerprint scanner is a little bit higher. I'm currently having difficulty getting used to it.
5. The charging pin Is wider so can't use one charger for all purposes and can't use data cable with other smartphones.

Verdict- My biggest priority while buying a budget smartphone was a Massive battery, premium display, above average Camera, average gaming and samsung brand name. And Galaxy M31 doesn't disappoint at all.  It's a well spent money from my side. If your priorities are same as mine then go for it. üëç
-----
Slow smart phone
-----
Phone is very slow because of the custom OS of Samsung, press lock button and it takes half a second to lock the screen, gets hanged too, not worth the price. Battery takes long to charge. Compared to other smartphone in the same price range, it's not worth buying unless you want phone with long battery life and the brand name.
-----
Battery Beast , Ace Camera but still needs to be more grommed
-----
I buyed phone on sale day 2 and received next day that , what I liked about the phone is battery Backup and Camera features rest things are pretty common like other competitors phone. Software is much better and impressive display in this segment.

Cons:
Volume is very low on call
Face recognition  could be improved
Lags and gets little heat up while heavy gamimg.
Fast charging is not fast may be because of bigger battery 6000mah
-----
Couldn't surpass Realme Note 5Pro
-----
The Camera  performance though  boasts a 64 MP rear camera and 32MP selfie camera fall short of the quality of  pictures &amp; videos  when compared to my other mobile pictures which is  Realme Note 5pro &amp; has 48MP rear camera. I failed to understand how Samsung could fall short to Realme even when boasting higher  specs.  Not satisfied with M31

MonsterLove!
-----
Monster phone! I have been using this for over a week now.
Pros
Very good camera
Amazing battery life
Beautiful screen quality
No lag
No heating
Calling clarity, signal reception and wifi is perfect.
Cons-
Could have given a non plastic back or at least a matte finish so that finger print smudging is avoided.

Loved the phone at such a price. Will be a monster killer for other budget phones.
-----
Best product at best price point
-----
Excellent product by Samsung at this price point. Worth every penny you spend. 64mp camera is awesome, it really takes some stunning photos. SAmoled screen is crisp and clear. Battery performance for moderate usage for someone like me can work 2days.
I am using Redmi note 7 pro from last 1 year, but this is certainly best in terms of performance as compared to Mi phones.
Finger print reader is also fast. The SAR value of this phone is also very low (0.3) as compared to other high value phones. Without any doubts this is the best budget phone right now in the market.
-----
Monster battery super camera quality GRAB IT!!!!!!!!!!!
-----
The Samsung galaxy M31 is the best phone to buy under Rs.20.000 I purchased the samsung brand after gap of 2 years. The phone is worth buying for the following reasons.(after using for 3 days).
1.Camera quality.(both front and back camera are awesome)
2.Fingerpoint reader and face reader works very fast.
3.The 6000mah Monster battery works for two days easily even for heavy user
4.The super amoled screen in this price range is great.
I strongly recommend this phone to all the buyers.
Thank you SAMSUNG

Excellent  phone and very much satisfied with the features of the phone.  The camera is too good and battery life is awesome. This proven again as Samsung is best in its quality.  The camera inbuilt AI features are very helpful and easy to use.  Overall I taken the right decision choosing this phone and that too with so many features within the reasonable budget.  I do recommend to my friends to go ahead buy this phone.  I also appreciate Amazon service who delivered this phone with in agreed time.

Bad mobile network and system process software
-----
I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day. Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes.
I expect this might be software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.
Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me. Plz no bay this mobile
-----
A complete value for money premium Quality phone
-----
A very awesome mobile, a complete  value for money.
Main highlights are its awesome display, battery and performance.
One can argue with the performance when u take gaming into account. But believe  me even in gaming its performance  is awesome.
Its a daily life phone, awesome super amoled display for entertainment ,6000MAH battery for continuous work and decent performance.

The thing i dont liked that much...
1. Camera pic output...some are good some are not natural, its seems artificial.
2. No fast charging support..it takes nearly 2hr 45 mins to charge it completely.

These are not major negatives about this phone if compare at the price its been offered.

GO AHEAD FOR IT.....üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
-----
Mega powerhouse in hand
-----
Best in size with amoled display.
Excellent delivery by Amazon within 24 hrs.
Mega powerhouse in hand.
Best in smooth processor.
With 64 mp camera, quadcore camera setup is good and macro photography is best.
No problem of overheating while using or charging.
Fast charging is good.
Totally a best phone with the price.
-----
Great deal and specs in this range
-----
Fingerprint reader is awesome both in its view and working.
Camera quality isnt as we can say 64 mp but the wide angle it creates and captures is awesome. Selfie camera is thumbs up.
Baterry life was the primary thing i went for and in this range this battery pickup is great.
The touchscreen, smooth touch, sleek and classy look is more than the price.
No heating problem, no hanging problem, bit of network connectivity problem probably due to the operator.
I would have given 4 straightaway. But .5 is to be added for the low price range and .5 is to be cut for the not so 64 camera quality. So i go with 4.5*
-----
Everage...GST üò≠
-----
1.Mobile best for day to day use....
2. display is best no can bit awesome display...
3. Battery is good and charging speed also good no problem fechin

Only one problem.. some  dust seen in tha box...and mobile repar seen dust... so its sellers or Samsung problem i I don't know.......
-----
Well crafted product, but very poor camera quality
-----
Editing the review since camera results are very poor. Too much smudges and noises and looks like either faulty product or incorrect advertisement regarding camera specs.

Well crafted product, but very poor camera quality
Pros -
good picture quality
Nice display
Biometrics is faster
Blue color on the back looks classy
Good batter life

Cons-

Given the specifications found the performance a bit lacking

Overall a good phone for the given price range
-----
Don't take risk in this phone. Go for other brand.
-----
I never had a bad experience but this is the bad choice , I choosed to buy samsung m31 phone. Bad experience. Main problem is too badly got heat back camera part and when you will make a call same back portion will vibrant. And also company given 6gb ram when you play online games , games will lack too badly. Maybe companies fault . Lots friends said after samsung is not a. Good phone for roughly use. This is ladies phone. Really I am agry for this. I got lots of problems. Even I didn't go for return coz from the next day lockdown also started.

Really a MEGA MONSTER
-----
DISLIKES:
I ordered the phone on sake day at 1 PM with delivery on the same day.
But Samsung shocked me by giving defective product
  Defects:
No sound will be produced by the phone in any of the below ways:
-headphone audioJack not working
-caller audio receiver not working
-speaker not working

Videos won't be played in the normal speed.It will only play at 2√ó speed.

Being the Samsung user in the form of TV,bluetooth neckband and mobiles for many years.I am upset in receiving the defective product on the opening day.Hope they will be taking care of quality control.

LIKES:
Replacement accepted and there comes the mega monster.Excellent performance with RAM Management,battery and  camera.

Samsung interface provides seamless usage.After receiving the quality product I even forgot about the bad first impression  created.

WHO can Buy:
-Camera is priority
-Wants some bigger battery
-day to day regular usage
-Normal gamers.Gaming performance is good.Any game can be played,but not at very very high configuration.

For this price,other Chinese products may assure more specs but the brand value decides the mobile life.Think wisely

PHONE WONT' SATISFY:
-Gamer addicts.But you can look for A71.
-onscreen finger print sensor-A51

Now I have recommended the phone in my friend's circle too.
For this price,this is a real mega monster.

REVIEW is about positive's and negative's.
Samsung should have eye on negative points keenly and that should be helping them to overcome the barrier.

Hope,I will be getting the JBL headphone for my review and Samsung won't betray me in this by giving the prize to positive reviewer'süòÅ
-----
Great phone at great price
-----
This is honest review after 10 days of use. The phone looks promising with the features detailed in website. I am using 6 gb + 128 gb space black varient
Pros:
1)super display- super amoled brings viewing experience to next level.
2)mega battery- enough for full day heavy usage. People who are interested more in social media browsing, its a major advantage. You need not to worry for battery backup as this phone has a power bank inside.
3) amazing camera- camera quality is just awsome. 64 mp camera adds life to images.
4) samsung assurance - this product has samsung brand value and id supploes with high quality finish and long lasting durability
5) no heating issue- even if you use phone for hours you would not feel any heating at the back.
Cons:
1) slow charging - even though samsung claims to have equipped the device with fast charging then also actually phone take close to 1.5 hours for full charge from 30 % to 100%. This might be due to large battery size proportionaly making charging time to increase.
2) missing led notification- though its not a major thing to note but could add value if provided.
3) As claimed , processor is not blazing fast, though this phone is great for day to day useage but gamers may feel little disappointment while playing high resolution games.

Overall its a great budget phone for modrate users and media lovers.
-----
Don't buy!!!
-----
Don't buy. Not worth 15k. Worst camera. Phone is getting warm for normal usage(not even playing games). You cannot return this after buying. Amazon will tell stories instead of refunding.
Amazon technician is not visiting on time and it's very frustrating after paying 15 k for this nonsense piece. Farid amazon.
-----
One of my best Samsung....
-----
I had previously used Note 5, S8, and Note 9 before switching to M31. Foremost reason was massive battery life, which has proved right.

Forget daily charging. Even with heavy use, phone will be on for more than 2 days without any charging.

Rest are too perfect... camera for daily use, looks, balance, screen vividness...

Finally do not go for Vivo or Xiomi or Realme etc. Buy this phone and never regret.
-----
Charging the massive battery is a big problem
-----
The best thing about this phone is not its battery but the display. And the most acclaimed battery (and its charger) is a dissappointment because it takes 3 hours to completely charge. Who has 3 hours to keep the phone for charging? Samsung should have provided a faster charger that could charge the phone in an hour and a half at the max, and a 15min dash to charge it 30 /35 percent. Apart from this the phone is great. Even now, Samsung can come up with a fast charger and people would buy it as per the recommendation instead of going for some other company charger which may damage the phone or its battery. Moreover the completely charged phone is good to go for one and half day for moderate use.
-----
Pissed off..
-----
After complaining
Same issue of reboot doesn't solved
Loud speaker quality is very poor
Sound output is extremely low
On full volume too....
-----
Post 5 days usage of M31 review
-----
At this price it will be a very good phone who has using other brands. Please find the below after using 5 days:
Pros:
1. Good camera quality, we can feel the change of picture.
2. Battery life is awesome as of now. It is giving more than a day.
3. Touch screen is very sensitive and I loved it while typing.
4. Automatic light mode, which is very  good option and it as acting as per need based on our adjustments on timely basis.
5. Optins wise also it has many features that we can enable  for the smart usage.
6. Quality of sound is awesome.... feel like we are in theater. Have DolbyAtmos option to change the sound effect. It depends on how you feel it.

Cons:
1. Vedio of the quality not that much  expected. Not sure there might  be some configurations. Not checked as of now.
2. Feeling little heat when we are on the sim card net. Also when we are on calls l, even this  also may be initially.

Finally with the above pros and cons we can buy it wth out comparing other products which are available on the market.
Thank you.

Display Phone not battery phone
-----
1. Display-Awesome.
2. Fingerprint-Awesome.
3. Face reader-Poor.
4. Battery - As the Samsung gives a 6000 mah battery but it going low in only one day from morning to evening.
5. Net network - very good.
-----
Best phone under 20k
-----
I had ordered this phone on the day of launch. I got it very next day .Appreciate the quick delivery by amazon. I have been using this phone since a week . It has been a really good experience so far.
Pros:
Battery life is really good and stays for a day without charging
Camera quality is amazing.
Smooth touch screen and quick response in  the UI
The UI part of Android 10 is quite amazing.
The sound quality is ok .
Finger print sensor is very effective.
Performance is really good.

Cons:
Sometimes phone gets heated up.
They could have given ear phones and a back cover .
The packaging by amazon was very average.
-----
Almost perfect!
-----
Almost everything is perfect!
‚Ä¢ The "best part" of it is its battery which lasts for almost 10 hours of heavy usage. Mediocre usage will last for like 1.5 days, ideal for long train journeys!
‚Ä¢ The camera quality is very good.
‚Ä¢ It stutters sometimes while heavy usage.
‚Ä¢ Google Due video calling was a bit laggy.
‚Ä¢ Don't know about gaming performance as I don't use it for gaming purpose.
‚Ä¢ 128GB feels like you don't need any storage device anymore. It's like you have your work related each and every thing in your pocket.
‚Ä¢ Experience of viewing videos at night in an amOLED screen is blissfull.

Not good. Awful.

UPDATE: I hate this phone... how can a phone just crash and reboot lying on the table without being used? This *NEVER* happened with my Motorola G5 Plus!

======================================================================================
Looks surprisingly thin. But not great. Samsung UI is ok, but not great. Lots of bloatware.. some I could uninstall, but some I couldn't. Installed Microsoft Launcher over the Samsung UI.

Took some photos.. it didn't stand out. Though I need to take more photos to judge.

The one thing which I absolutely HATE is the position of the single speaker.... it's just where I usually place my right pinky finger to hold up the phone. And this drowns out the sound of the video. It's very important to buy a phone with dual speakers.. preferably one that is at the top.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated after more than a month of usage:
- The phone heats up during charging.
- It has crashed and rebooted 2-3 times while in the middle of something.
- Low light videos are TERRIBLE.
- Compass calibration keeps going wrong. Every time I have to use it, I need to re-calibrate it.
- Speaker is not good at all. Part of the reason is the placement. My 3 year old Moto G5 Plus was much better.

I wish I had bought the Redmi Note 9 Pro :(
-----
LOVED IT. FLAWLESS. BEST PHONE IN 17K BUDGET
-----
Loved it!!!
Definitely value of money it is.
Ppl who are criticizing about the bad performance or poor camera , stop being a cry baby and STOP FRETTING ... Great fone within this budget WTH u guys expecting
Firstly not a big fan of Samsumg but this is some real gold guys.  great performance and camera is good too.. tho is not good for those who want to play hardcore games 24x7 ... obviously the battery and performance will degrade soon if such games played for long.. GO FOR IT..
-----
Worth buy if you value quality,brand over features.
-----
This was definetely a great upgrade from Samsung for me as I have been a customer since last 5 years.
Highlights for me
1.Macro camera-It capture pictures with every minute details.
2.64 MP camera-This is something next level as images were size more than 8 mb according to lighting conditions which is equivalent to dslr sizes and detailng is also crystal clear here.
Moreover the Monster Battery that stands out over all of these  6000mah,once full charge in the morning can easily run for 2 days.
 Loved it.
-----
Camera beast |
-----
Awesome device. The One ui is filled with lot of features .The camera and battery 6k mah is best.Camera quality is sharp with better detailing,good dynamic range.Must buy it.Selfie camera Sensor sony (imx616) is great.The 5mp macro shots are better.Built quality is better than m30s.The camera is far far better than any other brand phone in this price.But the back side can be easily  scratched so its better to use a case or vinyl.Battery lasts approx  2 days without using internet. Battery lasts 10hour 30 minutes of continuous
gaming, video playback, etc...
Camera: 10/10
Battery: 10/10
Built quality: 9/10
User interface:10/10
Display:10/10
Gaming: 9/10 ( medium level gaming. Better gaming experience in PUBG with medium graphic settings)
Pros:
-FHD+ sAMOLED display
-Accurate GPS
-Large 64mp samsung gw1 sensor
- 32 MP Sony imx616  sensor
- 6000mah battery
Cons:
- 15W charger takes long time to charge
_  Glossy polycarbonate body get  scratched easily.
-----
Budget friendly and quality for budget.
-----
Pro :
ui Is good
Battery life is good
Samsung has good display.
Calling  bluetooth , sound, wifi , everything good.
Camera is okay not that bad. Not that great cant find that 64 mp feel

Cons :
Phone is sometimes slow even for basic games u can find that crispyness literally
Switching between tabs is slow
Fingerprint at back is at wrong placement .. not that friendly
Face reader litwrally sucks. Cant identify faces all the time. Doesnt work in the dark. Obviously this is not apple.

Check for my pics taken from this phone.
-----
Monster in Power but worst in camera
-----
I bought the phone for the sole purpose of processing power and camera. Processing power is really great and so does the 6000mAh battery. But camera is really disappointing. You expect 64MP AI camera to match the standards but it performs really poor, even worse than my Samsung galaxy A70(2018) with 32MP camera. They should look more closely in building cameras. Phone has lag for some of the heavy apps but it eventually nullify soon you start using it daily. I would say if you are buying this phone for camera then DON'T please
-----
Monster from SAMSUNG..
-----
Firstly I was impressed by the delivery of the phone it was in my hand in just 10 hours after I book the phone in Amazon. Great job from Amazon.
Coming to M31, Really it's a monster. Unfortunately It got slipped from my hand on day 1 itself from 3ft but there is no scratch in the screen and there is only a minor rash on side panel. The battery was a beast and gives pretty good enough time to use the phone for long time. Camera was nice and overall phone performance was awesome. Really good product  from SAMSUNG.
-----
Value For Money
-----
Pros.
Super Amoled Screen. Immersive Experience to watch movies.
Battery Last for more than 24 hrs continous usage. Take 2 hrs 30 minutes to fully charge from 0 to 100%
Fingerprint &amp; faceunlock are fast.
Camera. Only 64mp back &amp; selfie camera are good &amp; capture detailed &amp; sharp images.
Samsung UI is lag free Smooth &amp; with Zero Ads.

Cons. No Cons so far...
-----
Battery and the screen slay :)
-----
I have moved down from note 8 which i bought for 64 thousand 2 years back, from amazon. I purchased this for 16 thousand. I was expecting a major downgrade but i am happy to share that the user experience is just as good. The battery impresse me and i am astounded that samsung delivered the same screen quality that i had on the note 8. Camera is decent but i am comparing it to a note so my expectations are high. The weight distribution is so good that it feels much better to hold than to hold a note 8. I have used it tocplay call of duty mobile and it works well with medium settings.

I dont think you can get better value for money at this price and that too with service support of a behemoth like samsung.
-----
Best trustworthy Choice against aggressive competitors
-----
One of the best options in the segment.
I preferred this phone for its sAMOLED display  and I am very happy  with it's look and performance.  To my surprise software one UI is smooth performing and practical.  Samsung's galaxy M series has been trustworthy brand against many aggressive competitors. Packaging and charger design could have been better. Anyhow satisfied with choice.

ANOTHER BLOCKBUSTER FROM SAMSUNGüëçüëçüëç
-----
This is my 5th samsung phone and following are the pros and cons for this product.
Pros:-
Build quality:-2.5/5 yeah most of it is polycarbonate which feels little lighter on side but it is better than glass back for those who use phone roughly it eliminates the rust of breaking.
Style:- 5/5 yeah it's samsungüëç
Performance:- 4/5 yeah it is a monster üëç
Camera:-5/5 superb it is,üëç
Battery:-5/5 two days on the goüëç
Display:-5/5 i love samsung s-amoledüëçüëç
Fingerprint sensor:- 5/5 lightining fast
Face unlock:- 5/5 lightining fast
CONS-
polycarbonate looks like plastic.
Processor is little dizzy for hardcore gamers
Physical Fingerprint sensor is a bit outdated now a days.
Polycarbonate back is plain and fingerprint magnet.
-----
Very nice smartphone in budget
-----
Immense battery life, quad camera setup and great display!
-----
I've got the 6GB+128GB variant and thanks to early access and Prime Delivery experience....
Pro:
1. The first thing that you notice is that the mobile feels pretty lightweight for a 6000mAh battery pack with impressive performance.
2. The 6.4inch FHD+ SAMOLED panel -  best display in the price range.
3. Versatile rear quad camera setup and front facing camera with very decent image quality, great video performance under daylight.
4. Refined One UI 2.0 with Android 10 out of the box makes the device snappy to use and.
5. The physical rear finger print scanner works pretty fast, accurate and even when the finger is wet.
6. RAM management is quite good and storage provided is great which can also be expanded upto 512GB.
7. Price.

Cons:
1. The same Exynos 9611 chipset from it's predecessor M30s is a decent processor and it handles the day to day tasks pretty well but the mobile feels under-powered for some reason. But at this price tag a Snapdragon 712 or 730 SoC chipset would be make this mobile an aggressive one.
2. The camera performance under low-light conditions is poor and makes the image look smooth lacking details. Same in the case of zooming into the subject during daylight. And again this is the only downside for such a good camera setup.

My experience with this mobile is quite satisfactory so far and I would recommend buying this mobile. Also use a case and tempered glass for drop protectionüôÇ.
-----
Worth the price
-----
Good phone for the price. Screen quality and performance are good.
Cons: Speaker not so great. Low lighting camera not so great.
1 star less for delivery.
Fingerprint and face unlock is good. Camera in outdoors gives great pics.
-----
Very slow charging
-----
Phone is never getting fully charge.fast charging is not working.after charging for 3 hours it reached from 10% to 50%.I think i got wrong charger and no where written on the charger that it is 15w charger.also battery performance is very poor.it is getting discharge very fast ,Also phone performance is very slow...
-----
Best choice under this price. Unmatched feature and camera quality.
-----
Nice phone with almost all advanced features.
Pros:-
1. Display is FHD and full marks to it.
2. Sound quality is ok.
3. Android 10 is handy.
4. Full marks ro 64MP quad camera.
Cons:-
1. Battery is never felt like 6000mah. Rather it performs like 4500mah.
2.while receiving the call the panel sensitivity is poor.

Overall value for money. Must buy.
-----
Disappointed.
-----
Never expected such kind of cheap product from Samsung. Both  Cameras are not only below the standard but really really cheap in quality. Have used for few hours before throwing it back.
-----
One single word Pathetic
-----
Very bad phone, not worth it. Even Amazon refused to to do the replacement. Feeling cheated by amazon. Next time no purchase any expensive item from Amazon.
-----
Value for money Smartphone
-----
Phone is just so good at this price range.
A quick review
Pros
Camera quality
Selfie camera is awesome
Screen is vibrant and colourful
Enough memory 128 GB and more than sufficient RAM 6GB
Didnt face any lag while playing PUBG
Fingerprint sensor is quick
Cons:
Speaker volume is just ok. Should have been louder
No selfie flash

Amazing phone with great battery life.
-----
I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks now and I must say that I am very much impressed. The camera quality is just amazing. Even in low lights, the picture quality is amazing. The screen is always been a usp of Samsung phones and this phone screen lives upto the expectations. Battery life is simply amazing. For me it goes thru the second day with almost 4 to 5 hours of gaming, 2 to 3 hours of internet surfing and calls as well. Fingerprint sensor is pretty good as well. I have not experienced any lag while using the phone and switching between different apps is smooth. Overall a nice phone in such great price.
-----
don't go on specification guys...i went n regretting now
-----
having 6000mAh battery , backup is only 24hrs on use so....shame on battery backup
secondly, upermost part gets heated time to time
and thirdly, face lock sensor is bit slow , camera is ok'ish and no back case inside the box
so overall at this rate i.e @16000 one should never look for this phone and plzz buyers don't go on the specification provided plzzz...i went but!!
BATTERY BACKUP IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE !!!!
CAN'T BELIEVE specially from Samsung
-----
Good Mobile from Samsung at low price.
-----
I prefer Samsung than any Chinese brand mobile because I believe it's more reliable and trusted brand.
M31 is having good display, camera is good, and awesome battery backup. Only  issue I found with this mobile is it takes a long time to charge about 2 hours, so having 6000mAh is not effective unless you keep it at charge on night (the reason for 4 star).
-----
M31 justifies its cost.
-----
Battery life is better than others but still it cannot stand for two days with regular internet usage.
Camera is quality is great.  But using wide angle view stretches the image and distorts the faces as well .
Big space makes life easier.
Fingerprint sensor could be more sensitive.
Just missed a wow review due to little things but Overall this mobile justifies its cost.

Big Mega Monster's Review......By Aditya
-----
Such a awesome phone at a good price. The battery is big beast and even camera can be seen like fabulous, images are such a beast one's and night shot is lit. I loved this phone and everyone should read this review and should buy this mega monster.

Pros:
1. Good camera
2. Big battery (Even it lasts 3 days and for standby it may lasts for 5 to 6 days)
3. Big storage
4. Super amoled display is lit.
5. For gaming its beast(PUBG works like cool on this one ,even on hdr ultra settings i got no frames drop.)
6. One UI 2.0 is best UI in this category.

Cons:
1. Slightly heats up while charging.

I'll declare that this phone is the best phone at this range.
-----
My first Samsung phone
-----
Pros:
1.Battery 6000 mAh- good to last for 2 days with moderate use. (I am not a gamer)
2. Camera- good at day light shots(front &amp; back). Definitely need improvement at low light conditions. Same camera performes better than this at Realme&amp; Redmi.
3.Display- Super Amoled- best
4. It does not feel too heavy even though with 6000 mAh battery.
5. Android 10- Samsung's One UI2. Latest with great GUI.
6. Finger print sensor- fast with great response.
Cons:
1.Exynos 9611 processor - average. Not meant for gamers.
2. Plastic back.
3. Charging- ~2.5 hrs to fuel the battery ful
4.Focus hunting- While recording video camera struggles to focus. You feel it only when viewed on big screens.

Mobile ka THALAIVA
-----
Really amazing phone  after 4days of use . Samsung is best in battery 6000 mah .  every  time I use to carry power bank for charging.  Now no tension , no power bank, and no charger.
Comes to display : really I am very  happy  for dispay  with low budget I got amoled display.
Next comes memory and ram: I bought  6 GB and 128 gb store and with expanded memory  slot.

For this specification: other phones are 18k +

Any way  again Samsung  is mobile ka THALAIVA

pathetic camera but superb battery life... a honest revirw
-----
Handson experience after 10 days.
Really disappointing product from Samsung. This is utlra hyped product. Its a marketing stratagy of samsung to promote it. Only battery is the feature of the phone which last around 1.5 days on heavy usage. i am a game freak and it is good for that.
The camera is pathetic mark my word pathetic its a 8 megapixel camera which they branding as 64 megapixel. when you zoom after cl8cking a photo there is no details. its all blurred out and you feel cheated like anything. the selfie camera sucks. Overall experience is bitter. I really dont like the smartphone. it is all plastic body and quite compressable. I have oppo reno phone i felt it is 1000% guinine than this cheating phone. Be aware before you buy. 2 star is only for battrry only battrry.

Average product
-----
Ok ok product...I don't know how people are giving so much rating for this product...
My review post 2 weeks of usage:
Pros:
Budget friendly
Nice camera with nice features.especially wide angle and slow motion.
Nice amoled display.
Battery is also ok.
Cons:front camera adding so many filters which I dont like...missing the natural picture die to these filters.camera specs dient match the quality of pictures.
Battery is taking around 3 hours from 0 to 100 which is too much time.at the same time draining in 1 and half days of modern usage.
Face lock is not smooth sometimes responding bit slow.
Very low sound comparative my any previous models whether its samsung series or redmi series.
Mobile also doesn't works seamlessly.taking 1 or 2 secs to open the app some times.

Finally so so product.and could be I expected too much from the config they mentioned abt.
-----
All in all better then average.
-----
Speed of mobile is Good, no hanging, smooth gaming. For me Camera not up to the mark...as I earlier used Samsung note5 and 8mp of note5 is much better then this 64mp. Samoled is great. Finishing of the product is so not good....alignment of fitting lacks perfection. Camera holes alignment or side edge you can see poor craftsmanship.

Must read before buying. In depth review of Samsung Galaxy M31.
-----
Samsung has done a pretty good job in the mid range segment with it's M series of smartphones.

Display: Thanks to the S-OLED the display is crisp and clear with excellent viewing angles, better than any other non samsung phones in the mid range segment. Colour reproduction is excellent, but too sharp if set on vivid. You can set it to natural through display settings for more natural feel.
Rating: 5 of 5.

Battery: First ever phone containing a 6000 mah battery. Believe me it is a mammoth battery, It gives a day and half battery backup with medium use. Normal use can easily last for 2 days. Phone feels light knowing it has a mammoth battery. I have Asus Max pro M1 with 5000 mah battery feels heavy compared to Samsung M31.

Rating: 5 of 5

Performance: The Exynos 9611 does a pretty decent job in handling daily phone activities. It handles pubg well too. But mind it this is a midrange phone, considering this it's awesome on gaming part too. For pubg, on high settings the device gets a bit hot but that's normal since pubg uses a lots of hardware resources and some game lag here and there, but again it's ok at this price point.

Rating: 5 of 5

Sound: Sound is a taken care of a mono speaker on the bottom right of the phone, Not loud but ok enough. The placement of speaker is odd for me though as my hand comes over the speaker while in landscape mode for watching videos or movies. Sound through headphones is nice (depends on your headphones too). I have a House of Marley Smile Jamaica earphones and the sound produced is crystal clear.

Sound: 4 of 5

Camera: My god the rear cameras are excellent in good lights. You can zoom the picture taken to the point it can't be zoomed further and you will find no or negligible noise in the pictures. Front selfie camera does a decent job too. Can be better in low light as the pictures taken are noisy and grainy. This will be eliminated in further OTA updates (Hope so). Videos are excellent too. The camera app includes all features for tiktokers too.

Rating: 4 of 5.

Call Quality: The most important factor of a phone which is rarely reviewed, only one word "Excellent". No unusual sounds while on call through the earpiece, even when on loudspeaker you can hear the other person very well even if you have some disturbances around. Mic does an excellent job as well the person on other can hear you clearly.

Rating: 5 of 5

Storage: It depends on the variant you choose. I bought one with 6gb ram and 128 gb internal storage. Massive storage at this price. 6 gigs of RAM ( DDR4) helps you seamlessly multitask without any lags or reloads.

Rating: 5/5

Conclusion: A must buy mid range device that has all the features a smartphone user wants. Truly an all rounder device.

Awesome battery life!
-----
coming from a Samsung S7 Edge, I always wanted a phone with an awesome screen and a good battery life. This phone has them both. Its a bit heavier than the S7 Edge, but it is because of the 6000mah battery. My usage is average and I have never experienced and issue with his one. first charging I felt that the phone was heating but that has stopped after the first software upgrade. Awesome phone for a budget.
-----
happly to own
-----
amazing handset in price segment, great features, most and important is don't want to by MI as its origin from Virus country, I feel my contribution towards India and exchange MI with this device.
I insist to all great Indians, never by from Virus country and replace or return if you own it.

King samsung M31
-----
I bought this phone because of the brand name "samsung". The first touch phone which I was used is Samsung(sliding type with touch). When I saw the add of this m31 I fixed this in mind.
  This phone is one of the most fantastic phone which I have ever seen. There is no words to say about The Batery life. It is Amazing. I can watch continuously 6 movies from 100%. Still the charge is 50% only . Even in my nonstop use I am getting 2.5 days battery life.
 Camera quality is also an amazing thing. Video quality  is like a Digital camera video. Photos are getting more and more clear during zooming.  Camera clarity is supeeeeerrr..
Fingerprint reader is excellent . It is too fast in unlocking using finger.
Ram is also fabulous.  No hang or delay. Sound quality is also super.
  From my point of view I have no negatives to say. This is an excellent phone . A huge facility in an affordable budget. I suggested this phone to 2 of my friends and the purchased too... so dear friends  pls choose this phone, u will not get this much features in any other phone. Others may have more features but they have no battery life and maximum 6 hrs back up. They have no brand value also. A small battery with more load can't use for more time. But our samsung is king. Pls try once u loved it u will not change ur mind.
  Still I am fall in love with samsung. Especially the battery life... thank you samsung team for giving this gift to us. ........
-----
Yes it is beast... but beast has some weak points too
-----
Its almost 1 month since i bought this mobile. 1st impression is impressive... you cannot resist picking  it up again and again... check every angle.. every service. Every settings... its marvelous...

Camera is good for normal user... but for pro's i would not recommend it.. though you can work it out with little change in settings and here and there... autofocus is not that good but definitely not that bad too... fingerprint gives trouble sometime but other than that it works like a charm... the only issue i had it that samsung did not provide  a light border around it... so user could feel it and pace finger correctly.. the day it arrived.. i downloaded many application from microsoft word to evernote... whatsapp to skype pubG to candy crush... more the 150 app are there currently on my device but no issue of speed while switching 1 to another.. though it gets little heat up while playing pubG but not that much... and lo lagging  so far...
And above all boss 6000 mah battery... for normal user ... if you charge your phn 100% and in normal use taking phone calls.. texting chatting..listening music.. playing normal games... it last 70-75 % at the end of day... woooow...
I am not an high end user... and i am well aware about price range... so for me ints 4 out of 5... but for those who need everything perfect kindly incrrase your budget till 20k i must say m31 slay every predator around it.....

Real Monster. Good budget phone to buy.
-----
After so much of research, I decided to go with M31 on the second day of launch. To my surprise, the phone matched my Expectations. Have to appreciate Amazon for the super fast delivery, I ordered it by night around 10pm and I got the phone delivered by next day morning 9am. Packing was good and safe.
I'm writing this mobile review based on my first 2 days experience with this phone. Will add later if there is anything.

Pros:
1. Very nice battery. It was coming roughly 2 days for a moderate usage in 4G.
2. Camera is very decent. Even though it doesn't justify 64mp, still I would say camera is good with clear pictures.
3. Display is too good
4. Phone is not very heavy and good to use
5. Voice clarity and signal is good
6. Looks very good and stylish too.

Cons:
1. Finger print is placed very high in the back, needs to stretch a bit to reach the sensor
2. Charging is very slow(I understand its 6000mah), roughly 2.5hrs, could have given charger with more watts.
3. Charging cable length is very short
4. No earphones provided with this mobile.
5. Speaker is not much loud as only one speaker is provided at the bottom
6. Has mild heat when we play high end games, but its not too heat also

Overall is a Good budget phone to buy.

Calls getting dropped.
-----
Almost every call gets dropped after 20 to 30 seconds. On same SIM , other phones are working fine. So , its device problem.

Expected more on other side but not up to expectations. Over all rating a B- if calls drop issue is resolved, else its worthless.
-----
If your looking for a decent phone with good screen ,UI, Battery life go for it
-----
Bought the m31 (6+128) both space black and ocean blue variants for me and my brother.here are my views about the device.
Pros:
1.Super amoled display which is more vibrant than IPS LCD pannels
2.Stunning blacks Thanks to the Samsung's SAMOLED DISPLAY.
3.Massive 6000 mah battery which lasts for around  1 and half to 2 based on our usage.
4.super user friendly thanks to samsung ONEUI 2.0 the interface is too Good.
5.come with android 10 out of the box.
6.The quad camera setup is decent enough and there is some auto focus issue which I think may be corrected with an update.
7.Decent performer for games like pubg,call of duty etc....
8.Always on display is very useful and get done the task of notification LED ofcourse there is some battery drain because of this feature.But trust me it is very less than you expected.

Cons:
1.supports 15W fast charging only which make the total charge time to around 2h 30 mins .but remember the capacity is around 6000mah which take more time to charge.
2.Design is too old as we are getting glass finish in other brands within this budget range.
3.Need improvement in the speed of unlocking phone using biometrics.
-----
Awesome!!
-----
I ordered this phone within few hours of launch, and was promptly delivered the very next day. Thanks to Amazon for on time delivery

I bought the ocean blue, 128 GB variant which is kind of dark blue and I really love the colour. I am no techie to review the phone on its technical aspects but as a common layman I truly love its performance since the 3 days I have been using it.

The set up  took really less time than I expected and it comes with Smart Switch App, which made the data transfer easy and smooth.

The pictures clicked from the phone are extremely good and nice, however I saw a flicker of light when I tried to take a slowmotion video. I am not sure if the flickering was because of the light or the issue was with the camera. but there was not such flickering while capturing a slowmotion video in daylight.

The battery back up seems to be amazing, Since 3 days I have charged it only once. (Other than the charging done on the first day for 3 hours). But the charging is not as fast, and I feel the 15V charger is not good enough for the 6000 MaH Battery

Overall I loved the phone it is smooth, fast and Vibrant.... and Im loving it
-----
Pathetic Mobile delivered.
-----
Pathetic product delivered, phone set delivered on 16th March &amp; i have gifted it on 23rd March, when the phone is switched on, phone touch not working, keypad not working, so many time requested for replacement, Amazon least bothered to acknowledge it, nor I have got confirmation for replacement, when we call customer care they say lock down, understand , my question is why amazon not accepting requests for replacement, I have requested for replacement( on 23r March 2020 )  before return window closed ( I e on 26th March 2020)

Overall for me it is a wonderful product by Samsung. It is just awesomeüëçüëç
-----
Overall for me it is a wonderful product by Samsung based on the price. Getting all this features in this price range is just awesomeüëçüëç
I would give Pro's and Con's that I felt after my use of 15 days

Pros:
1) Wonderful design
2) Superb battery life
3) AmOled display is amazing
4) Camera is also good
5) Fingerprint reader as given on the back is a plus for me bcz I have seen many on screen fingerprint reader going numb.. So this is having it at the back and it's just amazing.
6) Headphone jack is avaliable
7) Fast charging is really fast üòâ

Cons:
1) Phone heats up quickly while charging and when used continuously for above 30-35 mins
2) The touch could have been a little more smoother i.e. Less resistive
3) User Interface is quite complex, took 2-3 days to completely get aquanted with it

Average product, don't expect S20 quality. Battery is good
-----
Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) is an average low mid range product for a reasonable price. It is as fast as my Galaxy S7, but not as fast as S20. Please don't buy this phone expecting to be flagship Galaxy S20. You get what you pay for. No complains so far.

The Good:
1) Finger Print Reader is good - unlocks in 1 to 1.5 seconds
2) Battery Life is good - 1.5 days of usable

The Average:
1) Camera is average, please don't expect it to deliver S20 Quality Pictures, remember, you have paid 1/3 of S20 price.

The Ugly:
1) Bloatware from Google &amp; Samsung
-----
Great budget phone with amazing configuration. Go for this phone with Good brand name &amp; specs
-----
Pros:
1. Phone looks neat and premium finish.
2. Fits perfectly in your hand.
3. Camera quality is decent enough for the price paid.
4. Battery back up is good. Lasts for full day with heavy usage. For a normal user easily it will go for 1.5 days.
5. Touch is super smooth and super amoled is really great.
6. Sound clarity is good.
7. Finger touch sensor works perfect.
8. Face recognition is nice.
9. Super configuration in this price. No lagging or hanging issue.

Cons:
1. No back cover, screen guard in the box.
2. Heats up if map is continously on.
3. Night mode camera quality is not upto the mark.
-----
It's a winner!!
-----
This mobile is one of the best in its price range. Firstly, the battery is rock solid. At 6000 mah, it comes for more than one and a half day's usage for a hard user like me. The display is kickass and the other features like finger print sensor and face recognition works fast too. On the design front, M31 looks like an identical twin of M30s except for the camera module which houses 4 lenses.

The quad cam is good for daylight shooting. In the night, it does feel that Samsung could've done better. But again, considering the price range and other features packed in the phone, its forgivable, I would say. The charging is quite slow because of the 6000 mah battery.

This is my third day with the phone and wrt to the first impression, I can say that this phone is a winner. If your are planning to buy one, I would recommend you to buy the 128 GB version. Hardly 1000 bucks more than the 64 GB version. But with the amount of photos and videos you are gonna shoot with this superb camera, I am sure you would want to have more memory.
-----
battery life not as mentioned.
-----
Using this mobile for  almost 2 months now. Just before lockdown i bought it and it started hanging within a week so i wasn't able to place an exchange or return order complaint. The battery life is also very less as compared to other mobile phones I've used. Plus it mentions 6000mah which it definitely not at all acceptable. Also it starts to heat up pretty quickly and then you'll not be able to use your phone for another 30 mins. Not at all satisfied with the product.
-----
Best budget phone
-----
This phone for its price is best in class. While Chinese phones may pack more features but Samsung is clearly a class apart.

It has the best fingerprint reader which is blazing fast.

The camera is excellent at the price point and the AR feature is a new addition that is quite fun.

The battery life is awesome. With a 6000 mAh battery it will always last a full day and then some more.

It charges quickly even though it has a large battery thanks to the included fast charger.

The screen is the best at the given price point with crisp and vivid images.

The phone is snappy with zero lag. It runs smoothly.

The fact that it can support dual Sims and an SD Card without any glitches and the fact that you don't have to decide between having two sim cards or one sim and an SD card is excellent.

The gesture controls are handy and call quality is excellent.

All in all this is completely worth the money. At this price point you simply can't get a better phone

Perfect blend of Amazing Camera &amp; best battery life... Loved it..!
-----
Personally I loved Galaxy series, the Make in India products...
Features :
* With normal usage, the phone lasted over 2 days and you don‚Äôt need to carry a power bank with you anymore.
* Super AMOLED display is great and highly customizable with detailed colors.
* Fingerprint &amp; biometric are pretty quick
* Battery life is exceptional for this device 6000maH , lasts 2days with ease (minimal gaming)
* * Cameras are whole new chapter, high resolution cameras capture shots with huge detail...
Whats more interesting are the AReality support for this device...(in core)
* Even Flashlight has modes of brightness which is pretty useful...

Overall this is a great device at this price range supported by Samsung's best apps and customization...
Its a beast in performance, battery and camera...
-----
Super awesome
-----
Fingerprint Senser is great, it sense just in once. Battery life last for 11 hour when use randomly. Amoled display gives u a great fun while u watch any video. No lack between game and working. I love the product if u are searching a phone under 15000 u should buy samsung galaxy m31 6Gb with 64GB ROM. Features are amazing with new features and extra features than other phones under 15000rs. Camera quality is amazing with 64MP camera. It can help u read small words from a distance of 10m. Wide angle and macro shots are amazing. This phone is perfect in all fields in a very small price. Love u samsung for such nice product. Hope such new amazing products like this.
-----
Truly Monstrous performance
-----
Amazing crystal clear display and smooth operation. I am still not happy that the fingerprint sensor doesn't lock the phone, like my moto g. Still, it's quite a package and monster for the price.

Pros -
Screen
Camera
Battery life
RAM
Charger

What could have been better-
Fingerprint Sensor could have locked the phone
Screen isn't really scratch proof, which is understandable considering it's a 3
Plastic body
Processor is not in the league of a Snapdragon but still better than Mediatek

Overall an amazing phone, but please check for a discount. I got 500 rupees off and I'm happy.

Issue in new phone
-----
I faced problems from day one. When I opened the box and was trying to charge the phone adapter was not working. 2nd day I went to service centre and they replaced the adapter. Battery is drying fast while it is 6000 mah. I thought there is some issue with the new phone but due to lockdown I did not went to service centre for battery problem. I am facing issue every time sometime it is restarting suddenly, due to lockdown will Amazon exchange my phone with the new one or Service Centre will replace my phone. I do not want this phone it will create lots of technical problem in future. So please replace the phone.
-----
I am happy and I know it.
-----
Nothing much to say about disliking,
Because I love this phone,
Camera quality is best,
Battery life was my preferred thing to look for and so now I dont have to worry about it after buying this phone.
Finger print reader is working best, as previously I used some other phones whose finger print reader did suck after using for a month, but Samsung so far has done a wonderful quality built.
I am happy and I know it.
-----
Not suitable device for gaming and Battery
-----
I being using this device from the date of sale. As per my usage Battery bit draining fast and not up to expected mark as 6000maH. Battery working as same as 4000mah. And for PUBG kind of huge GB games graphics is lagging in this device. Gaming display not looks great.
-----
DISAPPOINTED
-----
I had recieved ae defective piece...I recieved this phone on March 16th....keypad getting stuck  from the day one...I thought due to software not update yet..bcoz one update  I kept it hold...but after update also same issue...I'm very disappointed

Technician advised to hard reset  phone .
After that also same issue...

Now it's corona lockdown...

Amazon won't exchange.. and won't respond....
Even delivery was worse for me....

Totally loss of money....

Very very bad..
About phone:
Initially battery started charging fast...now its very slow...
And people who habituated to redmi honor will get disappointed  with battery charge..

Samsung is brand  ..agreed...but ppl who wants flexibility more...I don't recommend  this product....
Even camera is also not excellent
..its just ok
Now I want reply from Amazon regarding  defective piece
.thank you
-----
My first disappointing purchase in case of smartphones
-----
Battery backup not very good. And i am facing frequent issues with network connectivity and also with sound.. I have to restart now and then to get it working again. Slight heating issue is also there. Overall, i am disappointed with the mobile. I dont know if these issues are in my handset only or is a model defect. Camera is just nice only and not great as i expected from a 64 mp camera. Screen display quality is good and touchscreen is very responsive though.

Amazing phone with #MEGAMONSTER battery
-----
Theis phone completely suits to all my needs. I have been using realme 3 pro for the last 1 year. The phone was quite good, but the samsung m31 beats it in almost every category. This phone has sAmoled display, quite loud speakers, type c charging port, amazing aesthetic visuals, sturdy outer body and fast charging. They still have provided a heqdphone jqck in this phone. But the main feature of this phone is its 6000mah battery. I work in a 9 to 6 job, and have my mobile internet on the whole time, due to which my previous phone's battery used to drain fast and it did not run for even half a day. I had to carry a power bank or a charger with me everywhere, which was not feasible. But since I bought this phone, I did not have to complain about battery even once, as even after heavy usage all day, my phone still retains 35% battery by the time I connect it to charger at night. Moreover, the phone is still not very heavy even after having such a big battery.

The phone has 4 cameras on back and one on front. The camera provides high quality and very clear photos. The people who love instant shots will love the camera. There are a lot of features provided with the phone such as time lapse, super slow, bokeh and many others.

It has 128gb storage (which is expandable) , which should be enough for most people now a days. The 6gb ram and their highly efficient in-house exynos processor ensures that there is no lag anytime anywhere.

The only main complaint I have with this phone is that samsung one ui doesn't support 3 finger screenshot and instead provides palm swipe screenshot, which is not comfortable at all. Most of the time, it doesn't work. I really hope they provide 3 finger screenshot option in the next update.

In the next iteration of this phone they can provide a faster charging option (more thwn to 15 watt) , a screen with faster refresh rate, more efficient processor and other minor upgrades. But for now I'm 99 percent satisfied with this phone( aside from that palm swipe screenshot). This is a must buy phone.

Samsung M31 after 1 month of usage.
-----
I have been an Samsung S7 edge user before this and bought Redmi note 8 pro and Mi A3 for my wife and Mom, and used those extensively and this review is based on a comparison of all these phones.
Pros:
Firstly M31 is at its price point of 16k for the 128GB model is amazing with its overall camera performance and Battery life. The camera is definitely better than the note 8 pro. The 32MP selfie camera has the right colors output for Indian faces.
My S7 edge's amoled screen was incomparably with the budget phones till now, but the amoled screen in the M31 didn't disappoint me at all. The 5MP macro lens now makes more sense than the 2MP macro lens of Note 8 pro which I believe is useless. The M31 macro lens gave some really good shots.
Android 10 out of the box and Samsung's UI is definitely much better than Redmi or Stock android of Mi A3. For multimedia, this phone is really good with its screen quality and sound quality with Dolby atmos support.

Cons: Although people say you do not feel that the phone has a 6000 mah battery as it doesn't feel heavy but actually if you use the phone a lot and for longer durations, you will surely feel the weight. Now that is also because I use a back cover with the phone but again practically majority of us will use a back cover.
Secondly the phone is not powerful enough to play games for durations. After playing COD for 1 hour, the phones becomes a little hot and game play shows some lags. So definately not for gamers. The Note 8 pro is the best phone for gamers at a much lesser price.
Fingerprint sensor is fast enough, not the fastest though. The only thing is they should have given in-display sensor on the front as if the phone is on the table I have to pick it up everytime to unlock.

Overall for people like me who like a good lasting battery, a good screen and a good camera, this phone is perfect at this price point. Plus Samsung service which I have used a lot with older phones gives the edge to choose Samsung over others.

Power packed Smartphone in pocket friendly price
-----
Samsung Galaxy M31 is a power packed Complete Smartphone. I did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and I did not find myself waiting for an app to load all over again.

The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. I enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which let you stream full-HD content.

I played PUBG Mobile on the Galaxy M31, and the game defaulted to high settings by default with the graphics set to HD and the frame rate to High. The game was playable at these settings and I did not notice any issues. After playing for 20 minutes noticed a four percent battery drop, and the device did get warm to the touch. The big battery will allow you to play for quite long without needing to plug the smartphone into the charger.

With my usage, the battery lasted us for close to two days without any issues. If battery life is important to you, the Galaxy M31 will not disappoint.

I found the Galaxy M31 to be quick to detect what it's pointed towards and lock focus in daylight. Photos turned out well and had decent details. Text at a distance was legible on zooming in. The smartphone enables HDR automatically if required. Switching to the wide-angle-camera is easy and you can get a wider field of view. However, while these shots look great as is, zooming in reveals that this sensor misses out on details. Wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges.

The Galaxy M31 is capable of separating subjects and backgrounds when shooting close-ups, giving a natural depth effect. The macro camera takes decent shots.

In low-light the Galaxy M31 takes longer to lock focus, so you will need to be patient while taking shots
-----
Best and Good mobile
-----
Galaxy M31 sports a rectangular camera module at the back in the top left corner. The camera setup comprises three camera sensors and an LED flash. There is a fingerprint scanner in the middle, followed by the Samsung branding at the bottom. Upfront, there is a waterdrop notch at the top and fewer bezels. The chin has a 3.5mm audio jack, USB Type-C port, and speaker grille (from left to right). The head doesn‚Äôt have anything. The left side of the smartphone is home to a SIM slot and the left side houses the volume rocker and the power on/off button. Speaking of the volume button, it is placed quite high and reaching it wasn‚Äôt as easy as it is on any other smartphone.

The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, which is known as the Infinity-U display. The name arises from the presence of a waterdrop notch.

The M31 is Samsung‚Äôs cheapest phone to feature a 64-megapixel rear camera, and using pixel binning, it takes 16-megapixel photos in auto mode. And daytime performance is pretty good. There‚Äôs plenty of detail in the photos and good dynamic range. The same goes for video recording. The M31 is also the cheapest Samsung phone to sport 4K video recording (at 30 fps), and apart from a lack of stabilization, videos captured in daylight look pretty good.

With a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, it‚Äôs no wonder the Galaxy M31 can last a really long time on a single charge. I always got a full day of battery life with heavy usage, and with light to not-too-heavy use, you won‚Äôt have to charge it until late evening the next day, at least if you stick to mostly Wi-Fi. Switching to LTE brings down battery life, naturally, but you can still get a full day out of it with fairly heavy use.

Best mobile phone under 20,000
-----
This is the best mobile phone under Rs  20,000. My detailed review after a week of usage.
1. Battery life - This phone has full day battery life. I don't have a television and mobile phone is my only source of entertainment. So you can imagine my usage pattern. I used to charge my old phone two times a day but not this beast. Easily runs through the day with maximum usage including moderate.l GPS navigation and high brightness.

2. Display - Again no other brand can dare to compare. Not even iphone. Best display. Keeping this one short because i am short of words for this display.

3. User Interface - Everything on point. One UI 2.0 is a treat to operate. Using samsung phone after a long time and it feels great to be back home after using MIUI ( xiaomi ) , EMUI ( Huawei ) and one plus. UI has all the important features and perfect placement to make it highly efficient and usefull. Screen transitions are joyful. Smoothness of another level. Feels like butter flowing under my fingers.

4. Camera - I have attatched few sample images where you can really appreciate the amount of detail this beast can capture. 64 MP shots are crystal clear with very level of detail.
Again i am short of words to explain the camera. Simply best camera phone under Rs 20,000. While all other brands keep explaining how you can use pro mode to make it intresting but in this phone you can simply point and shoot and results are always interesting. Also there is pro mode and many other modes if you still need them.
I have become a fan of this phone and a fan of samsung.
No negative points so far , i will keep updating this review in future if i find anthing good or bad.

My friend  grand master galaxy M31
-----
Hi,  my name is ranjith,  living in chennai and work as civil engineer,  thanks to make a valuable  chance for give a feedback about the  grand master M31, I didn't expect this much of best futures in grand monster galaxy M31,  bcus the camera quality for both front and back was awesome and unbeatable as compare to other mobiles with in a limit prize.

Battery backup was so good,  i did a charge last 2 days before but still my mobile have 35%.

Video quality for supporting all HD content  videos,  are best to seen with high quality and dolby atmis 360¬∞ surrounding sound.

Highly secured with finger print censore.

Android 10.0 and one UI 2.0  was performed good with out hanging eventhough while use large file autocadd,  primavera,  stadd pro soft wares.

It retains the same super AMOLED display,  exynos 9611 SoC and long - lasting 6000?mAh battery. There's also a small waterdrop notch on the display. However,  when you watch movies or play games on the device,  the Infinity -V display on the device doesn't distract.
Although still great at handling basic of daily use,  and even good at handling multitasking.

The company has  essentially upgraded the cameras to offer a higher resolution  64MP sensor and quad camera setup. Good photo quality in daynight

The sumsung Galaxy  M31 comes with a familiar design.
The galaxy m31 also carries  on the good work with phone's camera  system  which is quite impressive for the price...
The ultra-wide lens on the device  makes the phone more versatile at clicking different tyoes of shots.  5 megapixel macro lens for close up shot we found to be quite good

Great phone in the Budget phone Segment minus the old Processor
-----
I was looking for a budget phone with a decent battery and camera.

Samsung M31 seemed to fit in that category perfectly.

Pros
1) A gigantic battery of 6000mah with a 15v quick charging option. Gives you so much relaxation when you are using multiple things through the day. Have sailed through a day without battery charging.
2) The Live focus feature on the camera works pretty well for the price it is being offered.
3) Great captures with minute detail capturing under ample light. I am yet to use it under low light.
4) Pretty lightweight for a phone with such huge battery size
5) Two Sim card slots plus a memory card slot over and above the 128 GB storage is a bonus
6) A secretly hid Dolby Atmos feature which adds quite an impact on the sound when on bluetooth or earphone

Cons
1) A very outdated processor which doesn't do justice to the 6GB Ram being offered. The functioning is quite okay
2) Need to really work on the Face Unlock technology. I had to stop using face unlock on the second day because I was tired of so many disapproval from my phone
3) Once you disconnect the call there is a 2 second lag for the call screen to go away which gets pretty annoying.
4) Lot of redundant apps being given with the phone and loads of unwanted samsung apps attached which doesn't add value to your functions.
5) Plastic body with multiple hand prints if being used with a cover.

Overall If you are looking for  a budget phone with amazing camera and battery this is your phone. But if you are too much into gaming configuration it is not going to entice you much.
-----
Great phone! All the features are advertised by Samsung. #MegaMonster!
-----
I ordered this set on the first day and the delivery was amazing.

All the features of this phone are as advertised. The outer body is same as that of Galaxy M30s and M30. A little on the thick side due to 6000mAh battery.

Camera and battery life are excellent. The charger that came along with my set was white in colour.

Though, there is a bug in the phone (which is also found in Galaxy S10+) where the in-call speaker becomes your primary speaker. You can google about this bug. Hopefully, samsung will resolve it in the future updates.

Android 10 and one core is great. There are application like Bixby vision, AR emojis which is novel and interesting. Game launcher is also great in managing and organizing games.

Back cover is must as the back panel is shiny and smudges doesn't look great. Overall, the phone is great and price is reasonable.
-----
Value for money | Handy | Great Camera | Lightweight
-----
Value for money: Truly a value for money phone, as in this range you are getting everything you need.

Handiness: Great confidence on hold, I have always used phones without back covers and tempered glass. When I was buying this phone was thinking how will I manage this big phone but I was surprised as it is not slippery with a glass-like material which keeps your look on.

Camera: Great camera, I am not much mobile camera freak but when I used it I found it extremely great in the range.

Battery: It is fine, stays for 1.5 or 2 days was expecting it will last for more time but it is fine as there are many services which are continuously running so it's fine. And I was thinking that with 6000 mah battery it will be heavy but it's not as compared to other phones.

Sound: Quality of sound is very good whether it is speaker phone or as you can play music aswell and it's enough for a small room.

Screen: It is good, as it's a display and picture quality is great it shows real colours.

Backside: I liked this new material by Samsung which is used in the backside of this phone, as when you hold your phone, you will not feel it slippery and in this range it is great, the only thing I felt is it's backside cover quickly captures the dirt of hand and drops handprints etc.

Absolute gem from Samsung
-----
Before reviewing my samsung M31, I would like to share what I was actually seeking in a phone.
1. Best available battery life with fast charging
2. Good audio quality in video recording (for uploading acoustic guitar covers on YouTube)
3. A nice camera
4. Good enough processor for multitasking
5. Additional slot for expandable memory

This M31 from Samsung proves great on all fronts as per my requirement.
I am not a pro tech savvy who goes into the minute detail of every feature but would sum up the best I could experience in the last 5 days.

Camera Quality - My wife loved it more than her One plus 6T, pretty unbelievable though. Both front and rear (4 lenses) do their job quite well.
I video recorded a guitar cover and both picture and sound were upto the mark.

Battery life- one full charge lasted around 36 hours on a normal usage. 0-100% charge took around 2.5 hours ~ 150 minutes.

Gaming/Processor - Played Real cricket 20 and Gear club Racing, absolutely smooth.

Feel of the phone - Slightly bulky due to heavy battery but that's okay.

Most features similar to A51 but price almost 8k lower.
For someone like me who doesn't like to spend more than 15k on a phone, this might be the best option for you.

Worthy / valuedable / affordable / and much
-----
A perfect phone at affordable price !
Runs smoothly .. battery lasts long .. camera is fabulous ! Loved the shape ( it's round at the corners ) .. I'm a student getting such worthy features at such worthy price is surely a perfect deal for me !  Presenting you a picture clicked in hurry .. wonder about the actual photoshoot üôå

Mega Monster at 15k price range.....
-----
Pros
1. Excellent sAmoled display with stunning camera stills
2. Superb battery backup with 6000 mah
3. Blue light protector can be enabled to protect our eyes from harmful blue Rays emerge out of phones
4. Average processor but ok
5. Definitely a monster at this price range
Cons
1. Mobile gets heated up bit while using camera and other apps continously. Also, during software update
2. Full Mobile charging 1%-100% takes up to 2.5hrs for full charging as the charger is15w fast charger and not 25w charging like in other phones.

Overall rating 4 and 1 star less for above cons.

However,  an extraordinary mobile at this price range with a great brand SAMSUNG. Blindly,  go for it your budget is less than 15k
-----
One of the wrost phone of samsung brand...
-----
This is wrost phone of samsung brand. Because once a time samsung gives update a mobile. I am updating according to this after updating mobile screen looks blue and phone doesn't work. Any function of Mobile does not work it look like a dummy phone. I will call on customer service but he doesn't reply. So please customer don't buy this phone. If you're not believe please search on Google and YouTube also about this phone regarding update of this phone.

Samsung Galaxy M31 Review after use of 4 days
-----
Pros:
Good Battery life. After 100% charging I watched 5 movies (Indian) and used mobile data during my train journey. Battery lasted for 1.5 days.
Width: Width of screen compared to My old Redmi Note 3 is less and hence was easy to hold on.
I brought this phone for Battery and speed and I am totally satisfied.

Cons: In Sunlight brightness is not that g8t. My old Redmi Note phone I was able to watch videos without any issue.
-----
Brilliant Phone
-----
I am rating this phone 5 stars because -1.The camera quality is Brilliant,2.Screen Quality is Fabulous,3.The Processor is Fantastic,4.The Ram and Rom are Mind Blowing,5The Processor is Extraordinary.This Phone is the Definition of a prefect android phone.Well done SAMSUNG and ANDROID.
-----
Not good as expected
-----
Not worth it when you compare it with Xiaomi phones

Issues

--Heavier than MI phones
--Screenshot is not by scrolling  3 fingers as in MI phones. You need to press power button and volume button simultaneously
--screen mirroring is very poor does not works
-- Camera is also poor than MI phones
-- while opening web link gives only one option to open using Samsung Browser.
-- many other usability issues.
--overall you will feel going back to MI due to issues in usability
-----
Best midrange phone with packed features
-----
Likes : The phone looks stunning and packs great features. The best part 6000 MaH battery which never feels bulky as the weight is balanced so nicely. The phone comes with all positive features in good price point. The UI is easy to use and no useless preinstalled apps like Realme phones. It makes all sense to buy this device with name tag Samsung.

Dislikes: The camera could have been better. The back panel gets scratches easily during daily use and finger prints are easily noticeable. But this might be the case with most of the phones in this price range.

Conclusion : The phone comes with all good configurations in a good price point and there is no need to spend extra for just higher processor speed. Of course the more you spend the more you get but remember all phone get old and new ones replaces them sooner.
-----
A well balanced device to have.
-----
Display : This is an oled panel, the colors are
  absolutely gorgeous. No flaws.

Battery: This is again a plus point in this
  device, I use my mobile phone for 2
  or 3 days once it's fully charged.

Camera : 64MP camera has some dynamic
  range issues but it is good for the
  price segment.

  128 MP camera performs good in
  daylight not in night.

  Macro lens is great.

  I usually take less selfies. But the
  selfie cam is pretty decent.

Charging time for this device is long because of the monster battery.

I do not play games on mobile phones. So can't say much about gaming performance.

I use a lot of applications concurrently and this device hasn't failed me yet.

I am very satisfied with device.

M31 #MegaMonster
-----
I share some Tech Details.

In First Photo, You see Ram in GB.
(5.43 + 2.50)(Ram + Swap Memory)
Swap memory work same as Ram and its good to see in Samsung. In final words Samsung give you 7.93 GB instead of 6GB.(Maybe Swap memory use for Game boost)

In Second Photo, You see the home with 5x6 grid layout.

In third Photo, You see Software Details.

In fourth, You see black and white photo.(idk what you call)

Samsung Camera is good. Samsung also told you which look is good for shot.

Samsung M31 not support Knox Security.

Samsung with 6 with 128GB it's really a #MegaMonster.ü§™üòà
-----
Not that good as the Samsung brand is expected to be
-----
Likes:
1. Battery is good.
2. Camera appears good, though I haven't yet observed/used it keenly.

Dislikes:
1. The width of the handset is less than the optimal, making typing difficult due to the jumbling of alphabet in the portrait mode.
2. System heats up even during the simple applications.
3. It even hangs down while using simpler applications.
4. The overall software is not user friendly, making simpler things complex.
5. Not at par with Redmi phones. My Redmi Note 4 was better than it in many respects.
6. The seller is casual and not competent enough as the packaging was quite imperfect for the phone. The phone box was simply kept in a big cardboard box alongwith some other item, without any cushioning. The seller should be blacklisted by Amazon.
Redmi Note 8 Pro is a better option. I Regret for buying it.
-----
Excellent option at cheapest price in the range!
-----
Though I was apprehensive to buy this phone after using my previous One Plus 5 for the last 3 yrs yet I  must say that this by far the best decision I have made in the month! #M31 is a monster rightly as highlighted in their ads constantly. Few of my friends were chosen to give the first reviews and I am glad I believed them!

The 64 mega pixel camera is fantastic and has a good AI attached to it because it can differ food objects and nature pretty vividly. The finger print sensor at the back is quickest indeed. And the battery life is super amazing too. Though the charging scene is a bit slow but it's okay to give that time off to the phone once in two days.

I chose the 128 Gb option since I have a bundles of data to carry and the phone is clearly standing up to my expectations in the last 10 days.
-----
Satisfied and good performance.. Best Value for Money in this Range.
-----
Satisfied...very good performance and as expected..Amazon prompt delivery appreciable
This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
-----
Phone was great but sales was worst
-----
I'm very much happy with the quality of phone samsung come up with .
But I m much disappointed with the people's I don't know wheather they are from samsung or any third party agency of samsung  , calling me every day and forcing to write review, in addition of that they are arguing for the same , that's too much pathetic.
What's wrong !!! Hallo !

That's not sales , that's not how it works ,people's are writing their review if they really feels good , you cannot force !!
 If you do so it will always have a bad effect for one's who really developed this nice gadget.
That's  very wrong gesture just to get catch few review to increase sales . But believe me that may have wrong effect too..

Like I rated 2 star for a such nice phone which  deserves at least 4 star ....
-----
Excellent phone which is quite a steal for Rs.16000
-----
Pros:
Currently the best budget phone on market imo

Camera quality is excellent for a phone of this price.

Excellent display

Game performance is good. Had no problems running games like PUBG in high graphics.

Excellent battery life. Currently writing this review I haven't charged the phone for 2 days and still have around 40% charge despite using it frequently.

The music quality while using headphones is amazing, especially due to Dolby Atmos.

Cons:

Sound quality from the phone speaker could be better.

A lot of pre-installed apps was not to my liking, though a few could be uninstalled.

The icons look generic and all the good themes have to be bought through the Samsung store, or you can use other launchers.
-----
Value for money, except for dash charging
-----
I changed to Samsung M31 from One Plus 3, which I was using for 3.5+ years. This phone was a major upgrade for me. Quad- camera, super Amoled screen and humongous battery are the super cons of the phone. Being a non-gamer, I have no issues with the performance. But, overall the phone is absolute value for money. I would like to add a few cons, which I think should be taken into consideration while buying this:
1. No dash charging. Having used One Plus for quite a long, charging the phone becomes a bit painful for me. It takes close to 3 hrs to fully charged from zero. But, having a 6000 mah battery, it takes a lot to time to get drained as well. I was able to use this phone more than 24 hours on a single charge with quite heavy usage and screen time.
2. The speaker could have been a bit louder. It's not bad, but could have been better.
3. The phone is not meant for heavy gamers.
4. Camera UI could be improved a lot and could me made more clean and clutter-free.
-----
Worst Battery Life And Fraud Policies
-----
Worst battery life, It takes 5 hours to charge 100%, Battery Drains in 12 hours only for normal usage, Decreasing Customer Faith, There is nothing  correct details regarding  battery as it shows in the phones features, Amazon Also Takes Too much  Time For Inpection And Its Technician Are Also Fraud, It is So Hard To Replace might be impossible And there is no return or refund policy, So it's better not to Buy It on Amazon and save your money.
-----
SAMSUNG M31 HAS GREAT FEATURES
-----
I've bought Samsung M31 6GB|128GB in Ocean Blue through Amazon,we all know that most of the branded products where newly arrive we can get cheaper &amp; also genuine only on Amazon,
About this product i would like to say it has all the features which we want in our cell phone like camera clearity coz it has 32MP front camera with UHD &amp; 64MP back UHD quadruplecamera with slow motion &amp; other options which i liked &amp; 6000 mAH battery gives us long backup with fast charging  adapter &amp; its screen size is 6.4 inches allow us to watch video in High resolution quality
&amp; many other options,if you're thinking to buy
a phone i don't think any other brand give you
Such superior quality which samsung gives.
-----
Samsung has really lived up to my expectations!!!
-----
I am fully satisfied, as of now!
This Phone meets all my requirements to the fullest.
Batter gives me 2 days backup üëç
Camara is awesome, more than I need. Still exploring the features of camara, so much to do for a YouTuber üëç
The Biometric "Fingerprint Reader" is very sensitive and better than the previous phone, picks up instantly. üëç
It's a new launch &amp; I was worried when I bought.
Value for the price of the product.
Samsung has really lived up to my expectations!!!

Best bang for the buck
-----
The device is excellent
It gives u a premium feeling
The display is jus awesome
The amoled display is so nice
Very useful for the multimedia consumers
The front camera is not so good
The back camera is excellent
The  battery life is awesome
Not soo good with gaming performance though
Pubg like games will struck
U have to play it in mid to low settings
The charging time is more coz of the 15w charger, it's kinda old model

Conclusion:
If u are a multimedia consumer who watch movies and videos alike, and who are a battery fan, and would love to use the back camera much
Then this is THE BEST MOBILE FOR YOU

If u want more performance oriented phones for gaming purposes, and a selfie addict and don't care abt bat display, then this phone will disappoint you... I would suggest u to go for other phones

But other than that, overall the phone is great...
-----
Great phone at a Great price
-----
The product is handy, the display is very good and so is the battery.
But don't expect too much from the 6000 mAH battery. The features are great and the sensors work good.

Sound:
Sound is loud but clear. You wont be needing to attach it to a speaker when indoors. There is a special Dolby Effect for speakers which you probably should give a try. It is great.

Biometrics:
Phone is supported with Finger print scanner and Face unlock. And these are surprisingly fast as compared to its prior versions.

Apps:
Most apps are supported but some utility app like Samsung Pay etc is not yet supported by the phone. Please work on it.

Gaming:
So far so good. I have tried out pubg and Asphalt. The games work flawless and phone doesn't heat up as expected.

9.5/10 for overall performance
10/10 at this price range

You can definitely go forward and get your hands on it.
-----
Gives others a run for their money. Worth more than the price!
-----
I bought this the day it launched. The very moment it was available for sale and got it at an affordable price of ‚Çπ14999, delivered the same day via Amazon Prime. Its been almost 15 days of heavy use now

What i liked:
-Amoled screen is sharp and crisp at displaying. No faulty viewing angles. Drop notch is super stylish and gives a flagship look to the device. Videos can be cropped to fit by the finger pinching out action. i have never seen Adaptive Brightness work so well in any phone.
-Fingerprint sensor is easy to reach at the back below the camera. Quick unlocking and Smart Unlock works well. Face unlock is accurate and works well too.
-Quad Camera setup is one of the sleekest cameras and positioning looks fabulous. The camera is quick to focus, great depth, the 64MP produces sharp images with a focus on the smallest details too. It has features like Pro, Hyperlapse, SlowMo, SuperSlowMo, Panorama, Night mode, Macro (wide), Bixby Vision, AR emoji, Food, 4k video and so much more. The front camera is better than what it looks like. It has perfect positioning, quick to focus and great attention to detail too. Overall, the cameras themselves make this phone worth a buy. Not just better in this range of phones but also than most flagship phones in 40-50k range.
-Android 10 &amp; One UI2.1 are both very clean, precise and extremely easy to use. If you're on any os below 9, this will be a great upgrade.
-The biggest reason i bought this was the 6000mAh monster battery, it is not surprising that they do deliver their promise in this case too. The battery does not exhaust easily. Being a heavy user this battery, after charged fully, lasts around 2.5 days for me. The 15W type C charger that comes in the box takes about an hour to charge it from 0 to 100%.
-There is one external speaker towards the side of the charging port which produces clean and moderately loud sound. Dolby Atmos Sound is also an upgrade if you are looking for a surround sound experience. towards the other side of the charging port, you have a 3.5mm headphone jack.
-The Samsung Exynos 9611 processor lives upto its name. It is faster than i had expected it to be. Also, there are separate slots for memory and 2 sim cards which is a major pro.
-The phone in hand feels very light, despite its huge battery. The Ocean Blue colour looks sophisticated and might give the black variant competition.
-The box has a 15W fast charger with cable, user manuals, ejection pin.

What I didn't like
-It might sound stupid but there is nothing that i did not like about the m31. Maybe they could have provided a headphone in the box but given the features of the phone at such a low price range, that is understandable. Other than that, the phone has delivered to all the claims that it made and I think it is one of the best phones i have owned so far. Great competition in this range. Highly Recommended.
-----
Overall a Fantastic device with brilliant specs, Terrific battery &amp; within this Price Point...!!
-----
Received this from Amazon a week back. Here is review after a week's usage -
1) The build quality of phone certainly ferls premium for this budget.
2) Display is where I believe this device will surely outclass it's rivals. 6.4inch SAMOLED screen with FHD+ resolution looks gorgeous and colours pop out brilliantly. Even in direct sunlight I have no issues in seeing the content.
3) Camera quality is top notch even in low lighting conditions whether it be 64MP Rear cams or 32MP
Front, I infact felt the front camera better than my Galaxy Note 10+ in certain lighting conditions. Plus you get quad camera setup with ultra wide, macro and 4th cam for depth sensing, slow motion, 4k video shoot at 30fps.
4) Battery life is Terrific, 6000MAH lasts easily 2 days on a moderate usage with 4g Calls, WhatsApp,  fee gaming, browsing and youtube content. Icing on the cake is it comes with a 15w fast charger which is superb.
5) Biometrics works just fine wether it's fingerprint or face unlock, accurate and fast.
6) Best part is it comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack which is quite a feature these days. Although Samsung could have provided a headphone with it which I feel is a mandate, but nevertheless the prescene of 3.5mm jack won't feel you sad about it.
7) Internal 6gb of ram and 64gb of storage for base model is quite decent and performance is is quite good. It's fast, there is no lag in any apps. Morever you can expand it via external micosd card upto 1TB.
8) It has an inbuilt FM Radio which was quite surprising feature. There is one bottom firing speaker which ain't stereo but it's quite loud. Can't expect everything at this pricepoint. Moreover you get Dolby Atmos feature as well so mulimedia experience is quite good.
9) It comes with android 10 and Samsung UI 2.0 which I think Samsung has done quite a good job balancing the design, features &amp; usability where I think it's close to being the best software experience on an android. It's easy and clean to use.
10) Overall a well made device with a good usable feature set and good performance, great cameras, terrific battery and software experience. Would highly recommend it as one of the purchasing options while buying a phone in this pice range.

Affordable mobile phone for all range of population
-----
Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without doubt
best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India seller. I ordered on the first day 5th March 2020 of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Good:

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 50% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!!  Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
- Received two day later  by 6 pm!

Not So Good:

- Not that thin, but ok

- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue

- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.

Feedback

- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.
- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.

Go for it without any doubt.

Go for it if you are sure on technical specs

Pros:
Looks
Speed
Camera
Brand

Cons:
Battery. 6000mah works lesser than my 2 year old Mi Note 4.
Screen color - very yellowish. Whts are not real white. I am a b&amp;w photographer. I find it difficult to understand the whites while edits.

Amazing phone M31
-----
I'll start by saying this is the best Birthday gift I have purchased for myself, also my First Samsung phone.
I will start with the my experience with the phone so far.

Speed:
- Great speed and touch response and Apps opening time is amazing
- Phone boot up is quite fast
- Fingerprint and face ID is very fast compared to In-display fingerprint
- Gaming experience is good too

Camera:
- Attached the shots, see the amazing close up and night mode
- Super amoled display shows the  best possible colors
- Steady camera, till not I haven't got a single blur picture or out of focus, which is amazing
- Image process is impressive, no time delay in capturing and saving the images

Looks:

Trust if if anything matters the most to me is the looks of the phone, this phone looks amazing and quite attractive
One small issue - a bit slippery, but a cover would take care of it. I'm not a cover fan though, I like the phone the way it is.

Features:
Fast Charging
Android 10 One UI2
Memory Card slot
Best - 3.5 mm Audio Jack
Dolby Atmos sound
6000 mAh - more than 48 hours with moderate usage and about day and half with extreme usage
Charting time is about 30-45 minutes
NO ADs - The best part
Sound: Quite loud, over calls as well on speaker side. That's what I love

To be honest, I was so worried about transferring the data from old phone to new one, but found out the Samsung Smart switch app, within minutes every single thing(means everything) from old phone to new got transferred, absolutely had nothing else to do apart from installing the apps.
Assistant is also quite nice.
For me some things were hard to find in the new UI as I was used to other versions, but it has everything that other smartphones are offering and even better than others in the same price segment
Samsung Members is the place I found to be very helpful if anyone has any questions or issues to be discussed about the phone.
The only thing that didnt impress me is the Dialer, its split in 3 parts (Keypad/Recent/Contacts), maybe i'm used to the one page Dialer thats why.
Also the Notification menu, its quite big, I think considering the phone size its designed this way by Samsung.

I'm glad I chose a great birthday gift for myself, I sure am satisfied with the product. Thanks

Samsung Galaxy M 31, Real Full package
-----
While i was getting notifications about launching for Samsung Galaxy M31, i was eagerly waiting for it, and clicked on buy it on very first moment of the sale started,
I am using SAMSUNG phones since last 15 years, with various models,
I am fully satisfied with performance of all departments of Samsung Galaxy M 31 as like Quad Cameras - Battery - Processor - Super Amoled Display and dolby Atmos sound, all are Fantastic in segments of smartphones in mid range,
Very Good package of a combination of Many attractive features and technology in a Handy M 31.
Fully Satisfied.
-----
Budget phone with awesome specs!!!
-----
This phone is overall good for its camera quality, battery backup and its processor. Camera quality is great compared to other phones of this price range. Processor is very fast, as you can open up 4-5 apps in pop up window and the phone dosen't even lag a bit, not to mention gaming- smoothest gameplay you could ever get in this price range.
All that aside the best feature is its battery backup, with a full charge your phone will easily last about 2-3 days over its normal day to day usage.
Fast charging dosen't satisfy much as it takes around 2 hours to charge from 30-100%.
If you're ordering online, make sure to add to cart a tampered glass and back cover along with it, as these are not included in the box, also make sure its of good quality becausethe glass may brake if the phone hits the ground with the corner side.
In short, its an awesome phone and you'll definitely love it...
-----
Best phone for 16k (128gb)
-----
The phone is really awesome and worth to spend 16k on. It is very handy, looks nice (back should have been given some gradient design), and very light weight. Operation is very smooth. It is so user friendly that it assists searches, it has settings for almost everything you see on the phone which means you need not compromise with how it asssits you. The best thing I liked is its focus mode which is a must have in any student's phone...also we can create our own mode where we can decide which all applications we must be able to use while having a me time.6 gb + 128 gb is too much to get for 16k from such a reputed brand like samsung. I have been using this phone for past 3 days and it has not made me disappointed. This phone is made for normal users where all your needs are met. Voice quality is good on call, speakers are not so loud,battery backup is awesome with 6000 mah. Options to delete screenshots after sharing was another awesome feature. My gallery used to be flooded with unwanted screenshots and now its solved. Its size is also good. Enough for reading pdfs and watching movies and won't hurt your thumb after long use. I have a suggestion that the pack could have included a back cover also as most of midrange phones comes with backcover with it. Battery takes about 2 and a half hours to get fully charged from nearly 0. Phone comes with android 10. Photos taken are okay. I'm not a photography person. I'm really happy with my choice... Samsung has not disappointed me this time also. I happily suggest Samsung M31 to any normal user.

Go for it..

Newly purchased samsung m31 quite satisfied with the phone. In fact, loving this #Megamonster

Things to know before buying

M31 offers One UI 2.0 (based on Android 10)¬†which is out-of-the-box.
A smooth Android skin, it works well on most Samsung smartphones and has a few nifty features ‚Äì¬†Always-On Display,¬†Ultra Data Saving, and¬†Dual Messenger¬†‚Äì that add to the package.

6.4 full hd Super Amoled display is just Amazing which I couldn't find in other phones in this segment. It gives an enriched experience while watching Netflix or prime. It supports 4K as well.

The colours are vibrant and punchy and the text is sharp and  the sunlight legibility is also quite good.

It has a 6000mah mega monster battery which I love the most. Easily it last for 1.5 or 2 days. And it takes 2.5 hours or less for full charging. Trust me I use my phone for around 12-15 hours a day. With this monstar battery, phone doesn't seem heavyweight. Well done! Samsung

The Samsung Galaxy M31 consists of a¬†64-megapixel primary sensor, an¬†8-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, a¬†5-megapixel macro sensor, and a¬†5-megapixel depth camera, which produce great results in day-time. The images captured by the 64-megapixel sensor have good details and great dynamic range
32 MP selfie camera is amazing.
It supports slow motion, live focus as well
 Overall phone is awesome. If looking for a phone under 15000, I would suggest this is best phone in the market with samsung brand value.
-----
Awesome
-----
The Samsung Galaxy M31 is decently and simply designed when it comes to budget smartphones. There isn‚Äôt too much going on but whatever we have on our plates is still eye-pleasing. When I first held the Galaxy M31, it appeared quite bulky. But as it adjusted to my hands I got to know it was lightweight after all. Made up of polycarbonate, the device comes in two colour options: Ocean Blue and Space Black. I got hold of the black colour and loved the classic black tone of the device, which can never go wrong for a smartphone or anything painted in black. Although the smartphone doesn‚Äôt have a glass back, it doesn‚Äôt come last in the design race and offers us a sleek, not-so-cheap, and sturdy design.
The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, which is known as the Infinity-U display. The name arises from the presence of a waterdrop notch. It is protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is slightly disappointing. The smartphone has a number of display features, which are mostly in the case of every Samsung smartphone. There is Adaptive Brightness, Blue light filter, Dark mode, a choice between Vivid and Natural display colours, Always On Display, Accidental touch protection, Touch Sensitivity and more. While all the display features prove to be helpful, the accidental touch protection doesn‚Äôt really provide any protection as the device could easily be accessed accidentally.
Finally I will suggest others to buy this mobile because of the excellent functionality and features

Great phone by Samsung..
-----
After 5 days of use
Pros
1) prompt finger print and face authentication. Face recognition is too fast.
2)Camera quality natural. Quard camera +64 Mega pixel is the best.
3) Gigantic battery life. With all day use of netflix and toutube video, tuning songs , games..
4)it has real HD quality display , suitable for streaming netflix and youtube videos.
5) i feel it has light body due to fibre back cover.
6)Above all has the brand logo of samsung..

Cons
1)I thought that there was disturbance and noise while phone call.. and i was annoyyed but figured out that it was the network problem of sim operator..
So the conclusion is no cons yet
-----
Best camera,battery and screen
-----
Great phone for camera and battery and the screen looks so premium thanks for the superamoled with 60hz...and the battery easily lasts for one and half day...not sure about gaming though..if u don't play games for hours then it's the best pick
-----
The best mid-ranger smartphone till now(Under 15k)
-----
I'm reviewing this product after using for a week..It is absolutely an beast in this price segment..One thing about Samsung is that..Its super amoled display,security and build  ...

-SOFTWARE:8.5/10
The new OneUI 2.0 built on Android 10 is superb and user friendly..Also it has some good features

-DISPLAY:9/10
The 6.4inch amoled display  with full-HD+ is good...It supports Widevine L1 to which is awesome..The details were richer compared to other mobiles in this price segment

-BATTERY:10/10
The massive 6000mah is pretty good and it lasts upto 1.5 days for a normal user .Charging from 0-75% is good with 15W charger but after it takes a long time to reach 100% ..
Total time taken (0-100%) is 2.5 hrs..

-SOUND:9/10
The sound is decent..it has richer tone and no distortion at high volumes...The Dolby Atmos supports only with Earphones  but it was excellent. Call quality was good..

-CAMERA:7.5/10
As this model is just an upgraded version of m30s,it is just have been improved...The pics came out well in daylight..dynamic range was pretty decent....But video stabilization and photos at low light was not upto the mark..Macro was okayish...The front camera was okay ..But overall good..

-It is not suitable  for high graphics  gaming...
Overheating is not there...I suggest Samsung  to upgrade  the chipset in the future
-Fingerprint reader is very fast
-Phone is slippery..I suggest you to buy a good case for it.

Not value for money
-----
Writing review after using 2 months.

Amoled display is good.
Camera is hyped. Not that great.
Lacking to perform daily regular task.
Hangs a lot. Need to restart each time.
Initially 1 month full battery charge was taking around 2.5 hours . Now it's taking 5-6 hours.
-----
Best in this price segment
-----
I am writing this review after 10 days.
1.CAMERA
I found the rare camera excellent. The photos speak for there selves but focus is not available in macro mode you have to make exact distance about 3cms to clearly have a nice shot, the night mode is very good. When you open Slow motion videos, you fell lag on the videos. I think it is a software problem because i have seen m30s capturing good slow motion videos by having exactly the same proccer, I hope samsung will solve this problem in future updates.
when we came to the front camera, i think samsung tried to improve the front camera from m30s. It is very great but suffers a little at night time.
2.BATTERY
The 6000mah battery on this device is excellent, it last easly 2 days with moderete users. And can last a full day with heavy users so no need to worry about the battery.
3.DISPLAY
Perfect, no problem with that.
4.VALUE FOR MONEY
the best from devices in this price segment.
5.FINGER PRINT AND FACE UNLOCK
finger print is fast and secure, i have no problem with that. Face unlock is very fast during a day. But doesn't work sometimes at night and artificial light sources.

PROS
1.BIG BATTERY
2.AWESOME DISPLAY
3.GREAT CAMERA
4.FAST FINGER PRINT SCANNER

CONS
1.LACKS FOCUS ON THE MACRO MODE CAMERA
2.THE PHONE HEATS SOMETIMES BUT MANAGABLE.
3.FRONT CAMERA IS NOT SOO GOOD AT NIGHT TIME.
3.FELLS A LAG ON SLOWMOTION VIDEOS

Amazing Product - Worth 15k
-----
Awesome phone.

I I was concerned about purchasing Samsung products as I used to compare Samsung old phones ans Redmi products earlier.

After reading lots of reviews like this, I purchased this and I'm really satisfied.  I'm sharing a few pros ans cons after using it for 3 days.

Pros-

- Superb battery life
- Amazing Screen- Super AMOLED display is unbeatable
- Managed battery weight cleverly - not at all bulky
- Smooth and fast comparing to Redmi
- Handy
- 64 MP is clearly wortg every penny
- Provides Night view camera, Hyperlapse, Slow mo, Super Slow Mo, panaroma, Macro, wide angle and many more options..

I have attached some pictures for your reference.

Cons-

- Haven't provided wity ultra fast charging - it takes 3-4 hours to full charge
- should provide back cover
-----
Good phone in this budget and better than mi redminote 8 pro.

- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
-----
Monstrous phone indeed!!!
-----
There are multiple reasons to buy this product-
1. The best specs at this price range.
2. Samsung customer service and support is very good.since they have enormous number of service centres.
3. The phone is very impressive in terms of looks.
4. The battery is 6000mah which means you can stop worrying about the battery to drain fast.

I bought this phone on the launch date 5 march and amazon delivered it within 24 hours.The 64MP camera works really good even in low light,This phone also boasts a 32 MP front camera making video calls super clear.Dolby atoms makes listening to songs and music very good experience.
As far as screen is concerned super Amoled display with pixel density of 443 is best in class.I've been using the phone for about 4 days now and the phone works smoothly.The fingerprint sensor is fast.No heating problems detected so far PUBG works seamlessly in the ultra HD mode.I charged the phone to a 100% and then used the phone for about 45 min,to my surprise the battery was drained just to 1%.
So my verdict on the phone-
Battery life-10/10
Camera-8/10
Display-9/10
Software-9/10
Design-8/10
Performance-8/10
Value for money-10/10

Fake Samsung Phone Delivered
-----
Hi,
I would like to bring this to your notice that I had Purchased Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) Sm-M315FZKGINS worth  Rs.15,999.00 on 5th of March 2020 from Amazon Prime Account which was Sold by STPL Exclusive Online and got was delivered on 7th March 2020.
The Samsung M31 seems to be fake product, its not even a month the phone has stopped working completely. It keeps hanging frequently. While operating any application on phone, it stops responding along with this is issue the speaker quality has become very low (basically it does not functions) No Sound at all. Even while playing random videos on YouTube application as well in the phone's gallery it automatically gets fast forwarded without giving any command.
Its altogether a very disappointing experience not only with the Samsung Phone Brand but also with Amazon Prime Membership Account and the online Retailer (STPL Exclusive Online) listed on Amazon.
I would request to please get the Product replaced Asap, as Due to lock-down I am unable to even take it to Samsung Service Center or to any Mobile Repairing Shop.
Note: Kindly Respond to the above complaint, or legal action will be taken further at your Cost.

Samsung M31 upset
-----
Hello peoples, I have purchased this M31 Last month 18 March, am totally upset due to Samsung M31 because of more gaps in this M31.
 I will tell problem -&gt; 1. Macro camera ( in ad they show small boat photo ve≈ïy clearly from a distance but actually it not like that.
2. Only they additional  camera and increase the mega pixel.Additional macro camera totally waste.
3. Battery - 6000MA ok , when I put charge it take 4 to 5 hrs for full charge.
When i compare to my moto g3 it take 2hrs only for full charge in normal charge.
 Charging time  it take too much of time , it waste.
4. Mobile security, actually I interest in A50S for two main reason one for NFC and other one KNOX Security.
in M30 I don't know actually condition.
But I had review Spec of M31 in GSMARENA ,
NFC is available depend on market,
I saw many review none one not say about NFC they not no about that.

Due to KNOX Security, NFC, Battery charging time, Macro camera it totally  upset my mind on the first day of my purchase it self.

If any development in exist mobile model kindly do some improvement.

Positive point , 6GB ram It working well.
-----
Decent phone for the price. Could have been better
-----
Even though on the bulkier side compared to A and S series, M31 is a great phone given the 6000mah battery. This lasts me the whole day on a single charge.

The charger could have been 18+watts and the cable length is pathetic. Not even 0.8 M. Disappointed in the cable.

Decent camera, easy set up using smart switch.
Also brought a Redmi 8A dual and this phone is only slightly better
-----
More than worth it
-----
Finger print reader lags a bit and is not as fast as the phones other competitors whereas the camera is definitely worth the price (In fact more than value for money). I have compared M31's camera with other brands such as OnePlus and it gives them a competition (But obviously not overpowering them). Bettery life is something that I shouldn't even speak about, the phone lasts for more than 1.5 days for me and when full charged .... üòÇ 6000mah is all I need to say. This pgone overall is totally worth it, no lags as such. Samsung phones generally have poor GPS but there's no such problem with this phone. If you are looking for a phone under 15K then this should be your buy.
-----
Read 100% genuine review for m31
-----
I am old user of samsung mobile and i am big fan of samsung display...so for display 5 out of 5 stars...
For camara : i can give 4.5 out of 5 stars...-0.5 because of Samsung captures some high saturated picture.so same for m31 also.
For battery life : 5 out of 5 stars...coz you can go for 1 full day with 6000 mah battery..
For charger : it takes 2 to 2.5 h to get full charge so charger is fast but not so fast.
For performance: 4.5 out of 5 stars as per performance...i am using m31 from last aprox 20 days...i didnt notice any single lag in this phone...-0.5 coz of gaming performance...m31 is good but not that much...

But overall you can surely go for it...this is my genuine opinion on m31...

Budget phone with extra budget facilities...i m satisfied with my purchase...

Thank you
Good product with good price

Amazing Camera and Battery Life.
-----
Hi Guys, Writing Review after using the device for almost 2 weeks. TBH, I was about to buy Redmi Note 8 pro which is in same price range as this one but after thorough comparison i bought Samsung M31.
Pros :
1. Amazing camera. Samsung's M31's photos are more lively and provide you natural element of the clicking environment.
2. Battery Life. It takes upto 2-2.5 Hrs to fully charge the phone and you can use the phone for almost whole day. whole day because at the time of writing this review Lockdown is going on India due to Corornavirus, so i am  always watching Videos and surfing Instagram and Facebook in it.
3. Amoled screen - gives you amazing experience with Videos and movies.

Cons:
1. Not for Gaming - Since i am not gamer, this device perfectly suits my needs. But If you are interested in playing games i would suggest to go with other devices.
2. Charger - Should have given more powerful charger since 6000mah takes alot of time to charge the device with the provided charger.
3. Back of the phone does not feel premium. Feels like a plastic coverup.
-----
Samsung is a Useless mobile
-----
I got M31 on 6th March and with  in a month time there was a software update on April 10th. I accepted the software too  my goodness the mobile got hanged and its in downloading status from morning 11 am on wards........... Its like dum next to me .
Reason is there is a software issues in the mobile and also the mobile is getting hanged often.
Its not worth to buy in Samsung  no value for money and it a stress for us.
-----
Awesome  features  at affordable price(value for money)
-----
It's the first phone I bought from samsung to give it a try.
Camera:
32Mp front camera along with front wide angle ,64Mp main camera,gesture recognition while taking selfie,Bixby vision extracting text from images which i found are cool, night mode camera is little bit blur
Security:
A part from conventional security settings Face recognition screen unlock and finger print unlock is working well
Display:
It has inbuilt blue light filter and adaptive brightness settings through which we can able to see the screen clear even under the bright sun which is interesting
Battery:
Battery drains little bit fast
Fast charger and  capable to charge wireless
Apps:
ultra data savings mode which can stop apps background data consumption ,optimising space by zipping the unused apps and parental control which I found it new
At last it's a big YES for this phone which gives a hassle free experience it's a phone for convenience  latest features at affordable price
Cons:
Blur night mode camera
Battery draining a bit
Little slow in processing which effects gaming we can ignore it for normal functions

At this price,very good product from Samsung...
-----
First of all I will tell you about this product after using 1 week...
1. Coming to the bettery part.. this product has very good battery performance.. battery capacity is 6000mah..

2. I loved display of this product.. display is very very good... see the picture of that display.. i loved it.. this display is sAmoled.. for this price.. this is good.

3. Comming to the Samsung UI.. SAMSUNG has very good UI compared to other brand...it just feel smooth perfomance...

4. There are 64mp main camera.. and 8mp ultrawide camera.. and 5mp macro camera and 5mp depth camera... obviously 64mp provide very sharp images.. but while using this lens.. we can't zoom in... ultra wide camera is good... macro camera also good..

5. As we know Samsung has its own processor Exynos... this exynos processor has little power consuming processor as compared to snapdragon... but this exynos has very good AI about camera...

I couldn't find any drawback of this product at this level.. after using 1 month. i will update my review.. thank you

A Gift from Samsung
-----
Best high end device within budget in market. This time Samsung team have outdone themselves. Samsung m31 beats 24000 rs smartphones available in market
Amazing display quality
Awesome pixel density 411 ppi
Smooth performance
Superb look
Battery size is monstrous 6000mah biggest in normal smartphone market. First time i feel like i don't have to charge my smartphone all the time.
Camera quality is also also awesome
I was amazed when i saw this phone and purchased it on the day it launched.
Yes it take little longer to charge it but its obvious because of its battery size.
If you want best smartphone under 25k go for it.
Thank you Samsung for making such a device possible :)
-----
Awesome with happiness!!
-----
I have bought it on 5th March and delivered on 7th march ...very quick delivery by amazon.

Its short time of use but I ll guve review

Camera: simply awesome 64 mp is seriously killer..hyperlapse is awesome!! Very natural pics.
Battery: lasted for 1 day when i used it for full gaming and wifi was continuously used.
Processor: didn't lag while playing asphalt.
Sound : while having headset on dolby works awesome.

Cons: while downloading apps somehow it takes time to start dont know why but after latest update could not see further.
In this range its perfect ..may be more than expected has been delivered ...awesomeness delivered!!! Attached pic has been captured with zoom.

Read this before buying
-----
Samsunga galaxy m31 is a decent buy in this category, this phone is suitable for thoose persons which are not too much into gaming altough games work as charm in this one still not recommended fir intense gaming.
Pros
¬∞Awesome battery life, it is what it is claimed Monster.
¬∞Camera quality is decent
¬∞ display is awesome
¬∞ very light weight considering a 6000 mah battery
¬∞android 10 and one ui 2.0 works like charm
Cons
¬∞Cheap plastic made although it will affect you still glass would have been preferred
¬∞ when you second zoom in pics even in daylight the quality is bad
¬∞ slutters in intense games
¬∞fingerprint sensor is small for big fingers although this is the same fingerprint sensor used on all samsung phones in this category still samsung needs to change the diameter of the sensor, response is quick though
CONCLUSION: if you are really tech savvy, gaming type of person then this is not the right phone for you but if you need some brand value and a decent phone which can handle day to day tasks with ease then go for it.
-----
Only buy if you're an average user and your priority is battery life.
-----
Should be fine for an average user. I dont think this phone can handle heavy gaming. The only game I play on this phone is coin master and I've seen that game not load or just close on its own like 5 times in the 2 weeks I've owned this phone. Camera isn't that good. Display is ok. But its the large battery that is the only reason I bought the phone, and it does last long. Light gaming, YouTube, instagram, twitter, and other daily tasks is no problem for battery life. You can easily see 9+ hours of screen on time, I've seen as high as 11+. I was glad to see there is no idle battery drain. I go to sleep with the battery at 90% and when I wake up in the morning the battery is still at 90% or sometimes 89%. Which is great.
-----
Best to buy for normal use not for heavy use like gaming.
-----
After using this mobile for two days now im comfortable to write the review.
Pros
1.Strong battery back up(i got 16 hours backup without playing games but i was continuously using internet)
2.camera is way better
3.Screen experience is too good.
4.UI
5.No heating effect while charging the phone
6. Dual 4g
7.No lagging in apps as they have provided  6gb RAM
8.128 GB ROM which is enough
9. Big battery

CONS
Biggest issue is about network.Netowrk is not consistent through out so be aware of this.
1.Fingerprint sensor on back side.It should be on screen or it should be imposed on lock key
2.Material finishing looks cheaper they have used plastic as compared with other brands.
3.Charger should be 30W but m31 is with 15w charger as it takes time to charge
4.In the same price range other brands are giving fastest cpu where as samsung is giving middle class processor to samsung is giving its processor
5.As it is 10nm technology  it reduces battery stand by time while other brands uses 8nm which saves the battery.
6.Charger and mobile design need to be changed.

#MEGAMONSTER IS PERFECT AND WORTH THE MONEY
-----
Well,I had a doubt if i could purchase this phone or not!moreover I was between the devil and the deep sea!I wanted to gift this for my dad for his 50th birthday being a teen habit I saved as much I could and thought of spending my money to get my dad this soon the phone arrived and I had an etching desire to open this and somehow gave this as a present to dadü•∞he was word stuck and all wondered if that was brought from my own savings I was still 17 and none could believe I take this special section to thank the #MEGAMONSTER team for making my dad's birthday a remarkable one thanks again!! About the phone it was worth the money and was radiation radiationless reg. The camera it is wow very peculiar and more significant for capture.... on a overall the team had put a tireless effort in making this phone a great success.. cudos to the team.. and wish n hope that God should bless you people with all the good health, success and abundance of happiness in making this model
a great grand success‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
-----
Does not live up to its hype..however  a decent buy
-----
Things that this phone does not live up to its promise:
1. Front camera quality is not good. Dosent feel like a 32 MP definitely. Don't forget to  turn off the beauty mode.
2. The night mode amplifies  up things artificially
3. The main camera does not live upto the 64 mp hype- 48 MP cameras of other phones may be better. However for the price the macro, background blur effect and daylight photos are good.

The operating system with the android  10 is good, screen quality is super, built is nice, fingerprint  sensor  very responsive,  no lags, decent sound quality, super battery.
-----
Good in battery and poor in camera
-----
Product is ok...

Positive:-
1)Charge is drained 100% to 70% from 7 am to 4 pm (including data and phone calls) ...

2) Call audible quality is good...

3) Device Weight is low when compared to Realme

4)Display quality is good...

5) speaker sound is good..

6) Selfies is good in low light areas....

7) Auto call record is available

Negative:-

1) Rear Camera quality is not much high... It's an average quality... photo pixels are broken

2) Heat of the device is little bit high when data is on

3) There is no more accessories except Charger adapter and charger cable

4) Noice cancellation is an average... Surrounding noise is heared to opposition

5) Charging the device from 0% to 100% is 2:45 mints because of 15W charger

6) Face unlock not working in low light areas

Overall Product is good for battery backup users
And not well in Camera users
-----
Awesome phone for this price
-----
For office goers , home makers, I would say this is the best phone with best specification from a well known brand. I am writing this review after 5 days of decent use. Battery can survive for 2 days easily even with decent data usage. No heating issue. 64 MP Camera and video quality is so good like a flagship phone. Without a cover, the phone is too slippery to handle. Wide angle camera quality is okay but I don't use it frequently so it is not a big compromise. Selfie camera with 32 MP is a good trade off. No lag or delay in graphics, the transition is too smooth. Gorilla glass 3.0 is very helpful. Speaker sound and quality is very decent enough. Great Audio quality while using this M31 with bluetooth headset especially with "Dolby Atmos" effect on, which I didn't expect. I was planning to buy M30S, but after knowing the launch of M31, I was waiting for 15 days to book this one. Having a 64 MP camera phone would definitely need a 128 GB storage to store your beautiful memories. Worth buying, go for it.

Best one at the Affordable price
-----
- 128 GB storage is pretty good.
- supports 512 GB memory card with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone.
- Rear Camera is really good.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good.
Overall I can say is best one at this price.
As of now no negative side / disadvantages.
Will update again I find any.
-----
Not happy as M31 is very low quality
-----
Not happy with camara back and Front, even front camera is perform like VGA camera.

Also full plastic body seems Samsung made this PRODUCT by mistake and we buy to consider Samsung brand !

Compare to this other all phone are best in quality and money saver too with aluminum body!

Feeling like we fool that use this phone and can't return coz loackdown immediately after buy "covid 19"

This phone is a big black spot on Samsung brand image, I strongly recommend not to buy this.

Night mode also not working face unlock is also frustrating and not working most of time.

Mega monster: "A new age time machine"
-----
1-The Galaxy M family has now transformed into a much bigger lineup and garnered a lot of attention,

2-It offers very good battery life dats long for a 2 &amp; half day backup..

3-Scrolling through One UI 2.0 was smooth and apps were quick to open as well. Throughout our week-long usage, we did not encounter any slowdown or lags while using different day-to-day apps for messaging, social media browsing and so on.¬†

4-it does manage to click shots that are generally pleasing to the eye and come out with rich colour and enough detail, its just possible because of wide angle and monster 64 cam..

5-In the real world, this ultra-wide lens adds an all-new way to look at frames and click pictures fitting in more space than you would be able to use a standard smartphone camera.
6- fingerprint sensor captures impulse on d go ..
 Backcover is very shiny carbonate piece making it light weight .....
Excellent monster features on d goooo!!!!!
-----
A must take it and one of the bestest smartphone on its price cap
-----
Before m31 I have m30s  which is one of the best smartphone coming up at that range. Now as the upgradation move on m31. The camera quality with quad 64 MP rear camera comes with different modes is amazing and spiced up with Bixby vision you can click pictures that hard to differentiate from HD wallpapers. With the 6000 mAh battery can endures your smartphone processes for as long as 1 day of continuous activity (non gaming) Fingerprint is perfectly sensitive and better than compare to m30s. 6 GB RAM can provide perfect speed throughout the running apps. Best part about it sAmoled screen is one of the best features that make it different from other phones the colour quality because of that is completely amazing and on top of that while comparing it to iPhone 8 screen for sure samsung going to win over.
-----
Honest m31 user suggestion
-----
Mobile features justifies with its name that is mega monster.
Pros.
1. Battery life- as I'm using mobile from last 7 days it's battery life is beyond my expectations. I'm heavy user and battery running life is arround 48 hours.
2. Camera- four different cameras works in very good manner. Picture quality is excellent. When i zoom the picture it don't make blurred pixels.
Front camera is also doing it's duty strongly.
Mobile with latest features are excellent
Few of them are pop up screen, side button uses, good adoption of fingerprint sensor.
And the best thing is its super amoled display makes this mobile very attractive.
Cons.
If i talk about mobile cons there is only one what i get is- facelock feature is not working as good as i expected.
Rest choice is yours, but after using this mobile i have recommended my friends to buy this mobile, and give you suggestion the same.
In it's price segment it's really mega monster.
-----
Big battery, Exceptional Cameras and Superb Display
-----
The phone is absolutely amazing!!! I have bought it myself on the very first day of the sale, and by my usage of about 9 to 10 days, the phone is absolutely killer. Although it's not aimed for gamers in mind, the m31 still pulls off games with great ease and no lag. Moreover, the phone feels lightweight as a feather despite packing in a 6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging, which charges this battery in about 2 hours. The display is the best part of the phone. Extremely gorgeous display with a small notch. Moreover, the quad camera array at the back houses an 64 MP camera, which gives extremely detailed photos. The 8MP ultrawide and the Macro camera also are the best in this price bracket. I am exceptionally happy to upgrade from my old phone to this one, and I would recommend it to someone who is a causal gamer and wants a phone with a big battery, great display and awesome cameras. The hashtag used by Samsung #MegaMonster is truly apt for this phone.

MegaMonster

Amazing phone, smooth, feels more like i phone 11. Its battery takes a lot of tike to charge...but once charged alcan be used forever
Okay so, the phone is better than any other phone launched recently
I guess its been some weeks since i have been using this but this monster feels just like  a brand new one.
My suggestion is never put a screen guard or a tempered glass on the phone coz it lags the phone and touch response becomes really bad BUT..there s a setting for the screen guard users to increase sensitivity and it goes smooth again
The phone s brilliant and i love the performance and its very light in weight. The battery backup is cool and long lasting.
I literally watched a 3 hour movie with just 16percent charge in phone..
I suggest all the customers to buy a m31

Camera Beast
-----
I am reviewing this after 1 week use of Samsung Galaxy M31.
Design : Premium look and feel.
Camera : M31 has best camera in its segment. Picture clicked on it has very minute details even if you click the image very closely. I have taken the few and you can check. I'll rate 5/5.
Battery : Battery is also exceptionally well that lasts upto 2 days with moderate usage. 5/5
Processor : Till now it is running very smooth. seeing no lag so again will give 5/5.
UI: Samsung provides customer friendly User Interface. Face unlock works little bit slow but fingerprint sensor is very fast. 4.5/5

Earlier I was using redmi note 6 pro but I found so many issues specially GUI and device hang, I decided to switch to samsung and till now I am pretty much satisfied with it.

Samsung galaxy m31
-----
Yesterday I got stucked when I was using keyboard..I have to restart the mobile...anyhow after this I didn't get any problem.

Front camera is not much butter as compare to other mobile 32 mega pixel comera.
The image getting blured when zooming  the image.

Rear camera is good.
All sensors are working as expected.

Some features must be implement which I didn't find in this mobile like -

1. Internet speed status bar on the top of the screen.

2. Daily data usage should be visible inside the top scroll bar It will help the user to limit the daily data use otherwise he went to know only when he spend 50% or 90% through sim card notification.

Battery life is good and we are able user it more longer time as compare to other mobiles.

I love the screen quality of this mobile.
I got some new features in this mobile which are really  very helpful. Thanks Samsung!!!!!!

Looking  for smartphone  with long-lasting battery life, sthen SamsungGalaxyM31 is the best choice.
-----
Kudos to M series.
-----
Bought it a week back , best part of it is , its battery life which make me sure that i dont have find changing stations everywhere. Camera quality is more then average but definently not the best apart from it i love the price tag in which its available.
So kudos to M series .
Yet to explore its functions till date doing good.

Value for money i will say.

M31 in a review
-----
I did a lot of research before i bought this phone. 1.First of all, the battery life is absolutely amazing, a heavy user like me is not able to kill battery in a day.
2. The camera quality is quite decent. Although expected more , but for this price range it is pretty gud.
3.The display is top notch , its quite gud and colorful.
4. The fingerprint scanner has absolutely no time lag. It is very well made.
5. The performance is quite gud. Although, samsung Exynos was used. There was many critics who wished for Snapdragon,  but for daily use it runs well.

The only problem i hv come across is heating. Its not over heating, just little increase in temperature.  This happens only while playing high spec games like PUGB. It is not problem , just mentioned it just in case.

Overall, for people who are looking for a decent gaming and daily use phone. This Samsung Galaxy M31 is my recommendation to you.
-----
Great product in this price range
-----
It's a great phone with some of the best specs in this price range. Plus the battery is amazing. Camera clicks great pictures, night mode works really well too!

Feel of the phone, screen colours, features on the phone are all very good.

Very happy with the product :)

Attaching a little picture I clicked with my phone.
-----
worst mobile ever purchased
-----
-bad camera quality...they are saying 64 megapixel camera.....Samsung is making mockery.
-heating occurs frequently
-jiocall app never configured
-I want to return it but its not returnable...please don't buy any samsung product which is non-returnable
-----
Good deal to get..... worth buying.
-----
Highly satisfied with the looks of this phone..... camera is great but still trying to figure out what to do with macro mode.... performance is a bit compromising but still can't say it's bad in this price..... previously I was using Samsung M30 which had 5000mah battery but in that Battery lasted more than in this device.... would highly recommend to try this phone.....It can actually be called upgraded version of M30.....üòö I like it because of its display, camera and looks.... performance could have been more efficient but still it's good enough for daily use and gaming also. It has letest version of Android so hopefully it'll get newer versions of Android sooner in comparison of other devices running on older versions of Android.....In M30 also got upgraded versions quickly
-----
Best m-series smartphone
-----
Samsung has been doing quite well with m-series smartphones. The newly launched Samsung Galaxy M31 is a really good phone. If you have a budget of ~15000/- then you can definitely go for this phone. Performance, battery life and camera quality is better than Xiaomi smartphones.
-----
Phone for specific need
-----
So i have been using this phone extensively  for 4 days I decided to buy this phone as I consume a lot of YouTube content so screen and battery life was important to me so I chose this phone moreover something strange with this phone is that it gives me up to 1mbps speed on my jiofi(I live basically in middle of a forest..so that's great for me ) and cellular quality is top notch and the UI is just awesome also camera is top notch and all sensors are superb

To talk about cons sinc it uses exynos 9611 chipset u cannot expect a great gaming experience u can still game at high graphic setting but with mild frame drops I have tried pubg, asphalt 9 etc on this on medium settings this phone works like charm

So overall this phone is a great buy if u are stepping from other brands(previously was using a note 7 pro) but not a good upgrade as compared to M30s(almost similar)

So happy shopping
-----
Value for money
-----
The delivery of the product was very fast, I recieved the product within 48hrs.

Fingerprint reader: Very good 5/5
Camera: camera is AMAZING!!! 5/5
Battery: 6000mah battery is AMAZING 5/5
Charging: 15W fast charging is also AMAZING
Display: the display is amazing with sAMOLED FHD+ Infinity U Display, this is the best part that I like in this mobile. 80% of the manufacturing cost goes on the display of the mobile. SAMSUNG display is world famous.

SAMSUNG GALAXY M31 is an all-rounder

Samsung M31 Worthless mobile

Totaled  I love my Samsung  Galaxy M31. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
-----
It is  really a Monster M31.
-----
Well the Samsung Galaxy M31 is awesome phone. The 64 MP camera captures stunning  photos during day however you cannot zoom in 64 MP during capture. The camera quality is really awesome. Super Amoled screen is good and the quality is really amazing , it's  screen doesn't feel like you are looking at a screen. It feels like it's  a picture and your eyes never tired of it like it used to be in LCD screen. The fast charger provided is fast enough and charges at 1% per min. The huge 6000Mah battery is really Monster and last for 2 days for a normal user. I'm  really happy to buy such an amazing phone.

However I would like Samsung to include selfie capture just by using fingerprint  sensor , this is the only thing it is lagging and everything in One UI is amazing.
-----
Monster Battery &amp; Monster Camera long life phone.
-----
This is the phone have that all i have want to.
Big baterry : 6000 mAh that actually  i can spend my whole two days with phone without charging.
With gaming one day.

I m a photographer 64 MP camera help me lote to do.

Wide amoled screen is  very good.
Smooth touch.
Finger print sensor work so fast.
Also hve lots of features in settings.

Totally  worthy phone i m happy with samsung.

Cons: this is just a new launch so i didnt found screen glass n mobile cover. I still using this phone without screen gaurd n mobile cover.
-----
Very bad quality if someone is give me this phone in free I will not take it
-----
Mobile quality is very bad, heating issue, network issues, changing problem and camera quality is so bad, phone is looking like too old.

I have called many time to Amazon from first day and they didn't solve my issue.
Layout/user interface is very bad
-----
Good to buy
-----
Its a good product,  if you are Samsung fan or looking to buy Samsung mobile, M31 is recommended in this price range. Good Camera, 6000mh battery is enough to sustain for 1.5 days. Great display, dynamic colors, looks premium with a high quality case.

Audio Sound can be better.
-----
Justifies it's tag of MEGA MONSTER.
-----
The ultimate phone to have in the M series of Samsung.
As I have already been a user of M30s, I can very accurately describe I went for M31.
Besides the usual camera upgradation from 48MP to 64 MP (rear) and 16MP to 32MP (front) , I find M31 simply more responsive and compatible under my fingers. Besides a 6GB internal system storage and Android 10 OS gives you the feeling of a powerful machine in your hand.
Plus you get the whole package of 6000mAh Battery, 6.4 super amoled display and cool design that gives you the feeling of a premium smart-phone.
Well in nutshell, I can say this phone is a serious winner under the category of budget phone with all premium specifics and a sure thing to hang on to once you buy it.
Happy to buy it from Amazon, super-fast, hassle free delivery.
Word of Advice- Also buy a protective display glass and back cover to give your phone an ever-lasting long life.

Defective, first day problem of hanging and heating, not working smaller social apps of daily use
-----
Defective, first day problem of hanging and heating, even smaller apps not fully functional including social apps of daily use
-----
Only buy for battery. Better go for Vivo/Oppo
-----
The camera is not THAT good.. I mean the way they show it in the ads. But then again, at this price,  it's acceptable. The phone should have come with a cover cuz the metallic finish makes it slippery. The hardcover I ordered with it was of no use. I had exchanged my previous phone and got almost Rs. 5000 off  and I immediately regretted it as a lot of tools/in built functions do not exist in this phone. The only good thing which still is debatable is the battery I guess. I wish I had bought some other phone instead.
-----
Monster level performance..
-----
The product is wisely good to use daily tasks run smoothly.. app transitions were smooth . No stuttering or legs.  Display takes it all..crisp and clear with viewing angles...too good. Was so amazed by the camera picture quality . Decent pics lowlight pics were good too. Only con is the phone gets lil hot just below the selfie cam..if used for more than 10 min or on call . One ui is decent way better than touchwiz. Bloatware can be removed or disabled. Over all good phone from Samsung gives tight competition to other phones in the same price bracket. Monster battery the name says it all..more than one day or close to 2 days it can last.. gaming is smooth with lil frame drops..

Worth for money which we spend

It's my 5th Samsung mobile since 2011.

In the name Samsung means totally good .

Especially want to mention which I newly bought

Samsung M31
Reached my hand on 6th March

From that day to till  today (7days) working verdygood.

"Fingure print"
Working excellently some how faster.

"Camara Quality

Excellent for photos but not up to the mark for video recording.

GOOD BUDGET PHONE
-----
Phone is great in budget, Display is truly amazing .if you are into movies and series on your phone its give good experience .

Voice on speaker is low ,otherwise clarity is good.

Down side is exynos dont get feeling as that we get in snapdragon.
Not a gamer ,but I have tried hand on some and performance is average

Battery size claim  and performance is slight mismatch and with time and at time it feel like 4500 mph.

Any ways overall good phone

Build is good, feel is good

Get good backcover immediately or you can have fingerprints all on back of phone.

Best MegaMonster
-----
I bought this phone for 3 reasons:
- Awesome Screen
- 2 Days Battery Life Yet Easy To Carry
- Great Camera Performance

I am happy to say that Samsung M31 delivers on all the above promises.

What could have been better:
- Newer chipset although I haven't seen any lag in any normal tasks thanks to the great optimization done by Samsung folks.
- Battery charging time is a little high as the battery capacity is very hugh despite the 15W fast charging capacity.

I think it would be too much to ask for anything else from a device this good at such an amazing price point.

In short, if you want a device with an awesome screen, huge battery life and amazing camera - just go for the MegaMonster Samsung M31.

Beast with Less focus on Night Photography
-----
I got the delivery of phone on 6 March.
When you first boot up the phone you will get update for February security patch.
This phone comes with One Ui 2.0 &amp; the first best part of is you can delete preloaded apps. This ui is more snappy &amp; feels like a premium phone even though it's a midrange phone.
Pros :-
1) Super amoled display with L1 certification
2) UI is more responsive &amp; can be customizable as per our need which basically give a feel of stock android.
3) Battery Backup is killer you can do the excessive task on this phone.
4)Ram Management is on point.
Cons :-
1) Photos of night atmosphere
 are not good.
2) Speaker of the phone is ok.
3) Placement of headphone Jack.
4) Slow Charging speed &amp; length of the USB cable is too short.
Though, Samsung gives good package of software's like Dolby atmos, MrOwl for unlimited cloud storage.
-----
Not as claimed but still good phone
-----
Software isn't  as sturdy as needed, seems slower at most of the times.
Camera is good, but not as good as claimed. Even 6/10 as claimed.
Battery charges fast enough and gives good back up.
Fingerprint sensor is ok only, while as face recognition isn't even ok.
Overnight downloading stops by itself and you need to manually turn on/off the data to keep up the downloading. Checked all the settings but the issue persists.

I guess, Phone's software needs some sort of upgrade and the phone will be perfect among all other phones of under 20k range.
-----
Not a great phone
-----
Network connection is very unstable for Wifi networks, and the phone is very slow to respond at times.
Wifi keeps dropping off for 5GHz networks especially.
Phone shuts down automatically and remains in that state for almost 15 minutes.
-----
THE SUPERPHONE ( Mega Monster)
-----
I think it is the best phone under 15000/- .
Fingerprint sensor is fast and there is no issue about it. Camera quality is superb but i think if the camera's aperture were 1.7 then it will destroy every other company's smartphone in camera segment though it has very nice capacity to take very good pictures. The pics taken by it still so awesome. Atlast the battery life is very good. If someone wants to increase the battery life then they can use some tricks like blocking wifi scanning, blocking nearby device scanning , blocking bluetooth scanning,  using, dark mode, blocking unwanted notifications from the apps, using power saver mode, ultra data saver mode, and data saver mode. Then battery performance will be raise to the extreme.
-----
Literally Worthit
-----
Hey Everyone! Its almost upto 5 days i have been using this Flagship smartphone SAMSUNG GALAXY M31(6GB/64GB). My experience is amzing with this phone. Everything is working properly(FingerPrint sensor and other biometric locks) Camera is very clear and is making photos very stable. The most most most amazing feature in this phone is its battery lifeüë£ Even if after operating this phone for hours, playing games and using many other battery conusming apps it only falls by 10% or 15%. Best for gaming, it never overheats and no lag &amp; bug observed!
In comparison with other Smart Phones it is best budgetary phone till now on Amazonüòá
Grab this deal ASAP and have a good day!‚ù§
Thankyou for your Precious Timeüòä
Stay Safe üíØ
-----
Nice one
-----
So I'm using this device from more than 2 months..and I can say it's definitely not that a phone which I can call a brilliant one ..battery life is good camera is good..
Fingerprint is okay but will not work if your finger is a bit wet..but overall it's good for me..
No issues of hang-up...and yes with no doubt its samsung and you can go for it..
-----
A budget phone with some of the great features..........and off course the brand and it's class
-----
It has a decent camera with numerous features...........night mode is not very good it is just ok. But other features of camera do not let you feel the shortcoming of night mode.
Performance vise, it is good with fast speed and doesn't lag due to it's big ram. This phone doesn't provide bixby as A series do
Setting and notification panel provide many features  for great experience.
Biometrics is good...........1 out of 8 times fingerprint sensor doesn't recognize you but works good even with wet hands.......face lock is also decent.
The features that stand out from all of these are........its screen with amoled display is simply treat to our eyes, battery charger could be more fast but still it is good, performance and classiness.................if your budget is around 15 to 16k then you can definitely look upto this mobile

Budget Beast Samsung M31
-----
Nice move from Samsung
After SAMSUNG M30s
 M31 looks like an update Of m30s
With the price 16000
6GB128 GB

Photos are looks good taken on m31
With 64mp quad camera
32mp selfie camera takes good pictures
6000mah battery gives more comfort  to keep using more than a day-
Wifi calling option  good
Display good
Color also gives  a good look
I giving 5* because  no other mobiles  can't beat M31 within this budget
I'm a Xiaomi Redmi fan for the last 6 years
Mi3,redmi note2, 3s,3sprime,redmi note 5pro, redmi 8a,at last Mi A3
I changed my mind from mi to Samsung because  of the features in this low budget
I buy m30s, and m31
Are best to buy

Feel heating  while continuously usage .
Otherwise  all best in this budget
Thanks for Samsung

IF YOU ARE NOT A HARD CORE GAMER JUST GO FAR IT
-----
Overall good phone if you are not hard core gamer just go for it
Camera is awesome back side but front side camera ok but not so good.
Battery backup is very good,but face unlock take some time if compare to other phone.
Design of phone okk and light weight, overall after updating this phone no hanging problems no heating problems.if you want this phone to watch movies it gives almost 10 hour.this phone deserve 4 star but I think after some update samsung will fix the face unlock time duration.overall good samsung phone
-----
Average phone from Samsung
-----
Writing this review after 10 days of usage.
Pros:
Amoled display is the highlight of the phone.
Camera has improved when compared to M30
Fingerprint sensor works smoothly
Call quality is commendable
Dedicated memory card is handy feature

Cons:
Phone frequently getting stuck in Samsung logo boot screen ,software not stable!!!
Not a phone for gamers
Over heating while charging
Delicate Plastic body,so cover is a must
6000 mah battery will last 1 day only, don't expect more. Software optimization is not as good as miui for killing or hibernating background apps.Do to this ,battery drain is more.
-----
Truly a mega monster in this price range with intelligent feature.
-----
Likes:
1) The fingerprint reader works perfectly well even if the finger is sweaty.
2) Camera is fabulous in each and every mode.
3) Battery life as defined by the tag is a mega monster.It easily lasts the whole day with heavy usage and can last two days with light use.
4) The display is amazing,it is an awesome experience watching HD videos on the SuperAmoled display.
5) The always on display feature that Samsung has provided is appreciable.
6) Dolby Atmos gives a magical music experience.
7) The light weight design with such a big battery says all about the intelligent designing of the phone.

Dislikes:
1) The face recognition is a little disappointing as it does not work up to the expectations.It takes little more than the normal time to unlock phone with this.
2) The wifi connectivity is a little slow
-----
Giant killer
-----
Very good super amoled display, customized camera to AI beauty mode myself, very smooth processor more than enough for multitasking,we can easily uninstall bloatware, amazing Dolby Atmos music background,fast face unlock even in dark night,finger sensor added advantage and fast as well,nice wide angle selfie, super slow motion video recordings,4k videos recording, default assistive touch inside settings to avoid physical buttons, attractive infinity U display,6000mah battery huge boost for display and avoid frequent charging which last for full one day on Heavy usage, moderately for 1.5 day, customizable user interface,clear call quality without any frequent  drops,snappy 6gigz/128gigz....worth for 16k.... real megamonster
-----
Very poor performance of all Samsung mobiles all have hang problem
-----
I am using Samsung mobile since last 3 years. First one was J7 pro second A70 now Now M31 but all processor works in same way. You can't imagine some time it's take 10 second to connect the call after receiving so conclusion is that it doesn't matter you spend 15k or 60k in Samsung mobile the problem of hang will remain same. Very Poor performance just wastage of money.
-----
Sound lag n breakage, worst experience, even Bluetooth
-----
People before buying this phone I suggest to read this ...Their is a serious video and music lag or fast forward of voice n music..there is major issues in sound quality..these is the honest review..n camere is ok..phone also looks good...but issue is sound in video and music , n in YouTube etc. and more over another major issue is Bluetooth (apple AirPods)there is serious lag of sound and breakage of sound
-----
Good buy in recent times
-----
I bought one week back. The product is flawless. Build quality is good,amoled display make it equal to flagship version. Go for 64 GB if u already have SD card. If you already have Samsung phone you can easily transfer everything through samsung smart switch feature.
Battery holds good if you don't use this phone as hotspot all the time.

Touch sensors are good and speakers are fine.

Do not have any complaints so far except keyboard input seems lags at time hopefully some updates in future fixes it.
15k worth mobile n its worth it!!
-----
Best budget smartphone
-----
Initial product review - 1. the battery easily lasts for a day with mobile data on for the most part.
2. The 64 MP main camera produces amazing pictures with good balance
3. The new processor works buttery smooth with multiple apps running simultaneously.
 4. Also a type C otg adapter would have been appreciated
5. I would have loved to see Samsung release a matte black version of the phone, but the glossy "space black" still looks pretty good
-----
Amazing Specs. Worst Performace. Absolutely Worst Phone.
-----
I bought this phone on Day 1 of Sales. Excited, but Excitement didn't last long.

2nd Day started seeing issues like it hangs a lot, becomes non-responsive for almost 10 min and has to force restart every time. So requested for replacement. Got replacement after a couple of days, hoping this would not be defective.

This also started hanging on the first day itself. I think its a software issue.

It suddenly becomes non-responsive, you can hear calls coming in, but can't receive them, the screen becomes off, it won't turn on for the next 10 min or more. I have missed many calls like this.

On the paper, the specs and price are absolutely amazing. Now I realize why the phone is sold at lower prices.

Please let me know if any of you also faced the same issues.
-----
All pros with only cons... Galaxy M31
-----
I am giving 4/5 stars, one star less for not having folder lock feature.

I like this phone, it's working smooth like butter, it's camera, battery, processor are great and it is handling multitasking pretty well, it has great battery backup too. I am not a pro gamer so for me it's more than sufficient for daily working.
The only cons with this phone is that it is not having folder lock or app lock feature. To get his feature, we have to install third party app. Providing folder lock in this phone would have added more security features for users.

Real monster
-----
I was not so happy with the last samsung phone i used in 2013 and all these years i was using other brands and finally i decided to buy Samsung galaxy M31 6GB, 128 GB version..i had compared with other phones in this segment including realme, redmi, vivo and oppo.after a lots of home work i went for this one and in simple words it is amazing.in terms of performance, display and battery , its simply the best i would say. Finger print reader works very nice..its fast too.and even face recognition  works fast. The siper display is to he mentioned.and no heating problmes so far.and camera 64 MP back cam offers very good photo experience and 32MP selfie cam is also mind blowing. Battery life is to be mentioned in double inverted comas.its really awesome. It stays for almost one and half days. Multi tasking works very nice.In short as the name suggests, its a monster..i love the new Samsung galaxy M31 experience
-----
Prima facie review of M31
-----
Yesterday I received one. Very gooddesign to carry. It seems light weight.
I was little disappointed with packaging because brown box packing was not proper so we felt that may be somebody tried to replace something from the box. I was little disappointed when not found Head Phones inside box in Samsung Product. Camera quality is good. Overall very good battery life, fully satisfied
-----
worst software got hanged with in one month of usdage
-----
software update is bad it got freezed or hanged totally while updating software at time of lock down now getting replaced or returned is not possible and even service centers are closed even customer care support are unable to solve it so i had to buy new mobile.... i suggest pls do not go for this mobile this is waste product performance is very bad very slow gets hanged lot with moderate usage battery is also just one and half day, camera clarity is not up-to mark, had lot of belief in Samsung products till now i was using Samsung products now because of this bad product i strongly suggest not to go for this, it has got Samsung exynos processor the performance is not good....pls i suggest dont go for htis product.
-----
Quality is best
-----
If you really want quality then you should go for it super amoled display is too beautiful to handle so that's why if you really really e looking for a product which has beauty E and quality and battery backup then you should really go for it however I like 5 inch smartphones screen I am bothered that's why Samsung has not made of phone of smaller display thank you friends
-----
Prodigious
-----
Delivered within 24 hours.
Looks awesome.
Battery was 67% and lasted more than 1 day even on heavy usgae.
Camera is awesome.
Sound is good.
Display is amazing.
Mine is Ocean blue.
Loved the amoled display I'm loving my phone  and suggest  the same for viewers because on low budget you must go for this high end phone with 128 GB storage.
-----
WORST CAMERA AND BUILD QUALITY. JUSY FANCY SPECS
-----
Worst camera set up. Insanely thick and cheap built. Not returning cos it was gifted to someone and am kinda embarrassed.
‚Ä¢ ANCIENT CAMERA QUALITY
‚Ä¢ VERY THICK
‚Ä¢ CHEAP PLASTIC BUILD
Several other options with no such FANCY/TOO PROMISING SPECS.

I myself use two Galaxy Notes but now I have a different impression on SAMSUNG.
-----
Good Product with a decent performance and camera
-----
Why are some of the reviews mentioning poor camera etc? There is nothing much wrong with this phone. It is a good product and should be a smooth companion for an year at least.

P.S&gt; I don't play games on my phone. I wanted a great display (AMOLED), decent performance, good camera and a reasonably decent battery life. I got what I wanted and if you want the same, go for it too. Do buy a good case along with the phone because Samsung has not given a case inside the box.
-----
Best all-rounder in 15k
-----
Before i bought this product I've checked a lot of reviews and as everyone said it's good for people who consume a lot of media i went ahead and bought this.. This phones got one of the best displays in this price segment.. it's an awesome experience to watch movies and shows in this phone. And with the amazing battery backup of 6000mah we can watch shows continuosly for hours. The camera quality is also really awesome. I love everything about this phone except the charging speed.. it takes me around 3 hours to fully charge. I wish they would have added a much more faster charger instead of that 15W. Also sometimes the face unlock is bit slow or unresponsive. But as a whole i absolutely love this product.
-----
Awesome quality...&amp;smooth usage....üòãüòòüòòüòò
-----
Bang for your buck
-----
The phone is really a mega monster and well worth the price. 128GB and 6GB RAM, 6000mAh battery along with a decent processor and camera is a steal at this price range. But my camera seems to have a problem where all the corners of the photo except a central circle become blurry and so i cannot take a whole picture of even a page. It might be a hardware problem in my device or it could be a software problem as well. Besides this issue the phone works great.

Cheating  for amazon products
-----
Only battery  is best and camera  is very  poor quality  and fingerprint  reader is slowly  processing  and camera front and back camera is totally  wasted  that Samsung  M31product so overall  this mobile  worth of 15000 thousand  so I feeled tham for waste of my money these amazon products  was cheating  for me thus duplicat products  for delivery for me so I was complaint  for court I already asked  to replacement  policy that amazon customer doesn't  respond  for me and another  one time call doesn't  responds  that sir was tell replacement  policy not accepted tell so totally  Amazon products  was cheating for ever one people I was share that the a duplicate  product  for amazon for WhatsApp ,Instagram, Facebook,and ect  so be carefully  to order  for amazon totally  cheating ever one .
-----
Don't think twice if you stumble upon M31, because it's best.
-----
Nice product within 16K, although when compared with other options available in market this might not be immediate choice but believe me you will not regret being an Owner of Samsung M31.

Amazing quality of camera have already made me cameramen within my circle and a selfie geek, Battery is as promised, works whole day with just 50% with extensive use of GPS and WIFI and well as internet. What more can be asked for 16k when you are getting 128 GB and 6 GB memory with perfectly great fingerprint sensors and face lock.

Only cons I found: Weight should have been a bit less and size is not very much comfortable with skinny pants.

Overall, best handset in recent times and would always be looking for new models of Samsung within this price range. Good luck Samsung.
-----
Samsung aced at customer satisfaction yet again.
-----
Just an average phone...phone can't handle on its own the software glitches unlike Mi &amp; Asus phones.
A system update made the phone dead and now I want to return the product and buy a different phone given the lockdown situation in the country and all its service centres closed.

Please suggest what should be done?

Updated review:- stars updated from 3 to 4.
The samsung team responded well and recovery of my dead phone was made possible. Phone is working pretty ok since then except the battery unit in it. The battery efficiency has fallen since then.
Had the problem not happened, this phone deserved a generous 5 star. üëç
-----
Heat issue++++ &amp; under quality front cam... ( Front cam Just like a 12 micromax cam)
-----
Am only writing the cons:-

1.) Front canera quality 5years backward..(its a quality with 12MP micromax camera instead of 32 MP)

2.) HEATING ISSUE IS THERE... ALMOST UPPER ‚Öì HEATS LIKE ANYTHING....( EXYNOS chipset is poorer, past experiences from many users..i personally rely for a Snapdragon chipset... )

But This time i overestimated exynos &amp; i fail...

*Exynos is a samsung made chipset cheaply produced but most performed chipset are always with Snapdragon thus the phones they possess...

Exynos 9611 used in..14k galaxy m31...24k galaxy a31 and goes on i donno what they mean by this.. unusual distribution...

3.) Facial recognition takes time far poorer than my poco f1 but fingerprint scanner is ok but not that fast still ok...
-----
Without any doubt Go for M31
-----
I am using this device from last 20 hours.. My first impressions are as below.
Display-Super Amoled. Best in class. You will love it.
Camara-Rear camera performs  very well. No complaint.
Front camera is not up to mark. But overall good quality.
Processor - I am  not  heavy user.  It performs daily  tasks  very well.
Fingerprint- Quite  fast
Network Speed- very good
Battery- It gave me almost 4 hours screen time from 52% battery and 15% battery is still left. So it is excellent.
Software- One Ui very best.. many customization options.
Charging Speed- Not tested
Build Quality- You have to compromise with plastic back. But glossy finish looks premium.
-----
Heating problem
-----
From this phone I am suffering from heating problem....even any low use while talking this phone starts heating. It also heat very much when ever connect to charging or while charging. I am also suffering from network issue because network not work properly on this device. I have one another phone also from realme...no network issue I have faced till now but I samsung I am facing with same sim card.
-----
The extraordinary smartphone on a amazing price
-----
Acc. To its name it is a mega monster smartphone with mega features in a very very affordable price range, the camera of the phone is click the picture just like a pro,its wide angle is just amazing its front camera gives the smooth,real and sharp image and we can also do a next level editing,,the fingerprint reader is an awesome speed to unlock the phone,and the battery gives the next level performance you can charge once in a day and you are ready to rock also in gaming and everyone knows about the samoled display of Samsung.
It gives the many extraordinary features on android 10 version. I am not found any problem in this handset and very happy to buy this phone. Just try this mega phone bcoz Samsung give the best gadgets in best price ... i love this brand  bcoz  samsung is samsung
-----
Average phone in this price segment.
-----
Positive
Good battery  life.
Speed is ok.
Camera is good.
Screen clarity is good.
Negative.

Slightly bulky. May be due to higher battery Ah.
Sometimes  lag in switching app. Two times I feels in three days. After restarting it's ok.
Plastic  quality  need to improve.
Exchange only available for selection PIN code.

Overall worth for the price.
-----
Samsung must work on hanging issue other than that it's great choice
-----
Samsung must work on hanging issue other than that it's a great choice.

Pros:
Fingerprint reader works well. 8/10
Camera quality is best in this price segment.
Rear camera. 10/10
Front camera. 9/10
Battery goes upto 1 day on a normal usage. 7/10
Display quality is awesome. 10/10
Features provided are great. 8/10

Cons:
Phone hangs alot, Samsung must need work on hanging issue as it is still there in this device.
Also, I've got some issues with network hope it will be fixed in next update.
Samsung's knox security is missing.
Samsung please check for above and fix in next update as soon as possible.

I'm planning to buy one more if these issues gets fixed otherwise need to go for another option.
-----
Everything is fine some glitches are still there
-----
On the 11th day of delivery  of phone, sound of main speaker  get down. I don't know why but it's not very low. Even I can't hear the ringtone. Over all phones built quality is awesome as well outstanding camera performance.
-----
¬© 1996-2020, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates
-----
Its everything that the advertisement says!
-----
Considering how much it costed me and the brand I invested in , I very happily and confidently say that this phone is precisely everything that the advertisement say about it.  It's been 12 days since I bought this handset and so far I have never run out of battery. My son and I both, have been playing pubg for hours and though there are super minor glitches which one can easily ignore..this phone has been awesome. The camera and finger print sensors are super fine and quick.

The phone appears more worth than its value to me.

If you are planning to  buy a handset, go for M31 without even a single doubt in mind.
-----
Best camera and touchscreen
-----
The camera quality is really exciting with 64 MP quad camera capturing almost all details. The macro and wide angle options makes it outstanding for this price. However, sometimes when required to take fast actions, focus is being lost. Autofocus is not so quick as well.  32 MP front camera is a beast!!!
The smoothness of display and screen is highly appreciable and commendable and this will be the best in this price range.
Finger print reader should have been onscreen and the case could be ceramic or metalic which are being offered by other manufacturers for this price or lower.
Eventhough it is claimed to be 6000 mAh, draining of battery is quick and you need to recharge once in a day.
Unexpected crash of apps is also observed within one week of time.

Best phone for mountaineer
-----
As a mountain  guide I always go for  a phone  with  a big batteries, since  there  is limited  chance to find  wall sockets.  So I found  this phone perfect do those  who live  off the grid's.  Plus  the camera it takes  perfect photograph,, thanks to Samsung now I don't  have  to carry  my bulky  DSLR every time  I go to an expedition. Above  are the  two main features I have  been  looking from a smartphone, screen  visibility  was also great when I was at glacier. Samsung  should transform this phone  into a Rugged  smartphone. And one more thing,  Image stabilizer during  video capture  was amazingly  smooth.
Thanks Samsung
And thanks  Amazon  for its super fast  delivery.

Samsung M31- Pros &amp; cons
-----
Samsung M31 is a Best quality product having  the great performance and built quality is also good with the latest Android 10

 That is available in chipest price.

M31's comes with 64mp quad camera and 6.4 Amoled display are amazing.
Camera comes with lots of modes like
Slow motion, super-slow-mo, live focus,  macro shot, night mode, ultra wide shot &amp; many more filters.

 3 stars to it's battery life
Because  while using phone it releasing  heat.
Samsung  announced  that the new M31 will come with 6000mAh battery although the performance  is good but battery life is not satisfactory.
In other hand i will say that it has the 6000 mAh battery  but the charger  is 15V that is not suitable  to charge a heavy battery.
-----
Worth Buy
-----
Recently I purchased Samsung Galaxy M31 on Amazon. I have been using this phone for past 2 weeks and here are my feedbacks.

Pros:
Color of the phone is really cool and looks awesome.
Loading of apps is faster
Front and Back camera is really good and output of the pictures are excellent during the day-light.
Audio quality using headphones gives you a different experience altogether.
Battery life lasts for 48-72 hours, if you are a regular user. If you are heavy user it should last some where between 23 to 36 hours.

Cons:
Pictures taken in night mode is decent.
The phone gets slighted heated when you are using for a longer duration.
-----
My personel review
-----
Well no doubt indeed it was one of the most awaited mobile phone of 2020 and I must say It was worth it ,6000 mah battery , 64mp camera and many more cool and latest features
But there was one minute areas where I believe the creature should have taken care of
  - length of data cable
No doubt the charger is a fast charger still it would have been appropriate if the length of cable was bit longer
Last but not the least as a Samsung user I never get tired of bragging the level of service you provide us at your service centre ..pls keep it like this always
üß°
-----
Excellent &amp; recommend
-----
I am very happy to review on my recent purchase Samsung M31 mobile phone.
Performance is very Good as it is having Octa core processor with 6 GB RAM.

The Display is Super Amoled with 6.4 inch screen which is fantastic &amp; I can say that No other phone comes closer in this budget segment.

The highlight of the mobile is its Camera, possessing Quad camera of 64+ 8 + 5 + 5 MP Primary Cameras &amp; 32 MP Front Camera. The attached photos are taken from this phone as the font size is so small to read, Phone helped me in reading see the clarity.

Now I will give 5 rating for its monster Battery of 6000mAh

Why I strictly Recommend others to go for this phone because of its lowest SAR value.

Amazing phone at budget price
-----
Phone is a steal at current price, giving best specs in the range and lots of features.  Samsung has really worked and delivered a product which exceeds market expectations.
Samsung has done amazing job on the latest One UI. It is more intuitive and fast. Also, it works very well with all sorts of apps.
Of course, the camera is exceptional,  especially its  64MP mode which has good detailing.
The display also looks excellent as it's super amoled which was only available in higher end models until now.
Holding and using the phone is also very easy due to sleek design and less weight even with the mega battery. The battery backup is amazing,  giving me 2 days battery life on single charge with good usage.
Definitely worth every rupee.

Best at this range with good build quality and gives feel of mega monster at every step of usage.
-----
This new Samsung beast is monster in every aspect i.e., monster 6000mah battery, monster 64MP main rear camera, monster super amoled full HD+ display, and many more.. This new monster is very slim and very easy to handle and use. 4 different camera lenses helps us to captureevery type of shot as we seek in a perfect manner.
Other phones Samsung don't give 6000 mah battery with the 64 MP camera and super amoled full HD display altogether at this rate.
15W fast charger takes almost 1.5-2 hours to charge this big batteryvwhich lasts for almost 2 days with normal internet and other uses.
So one must go for this M31 because at this price, this is the only one phone in this segment which provides customer all types of major functions at this rate.
-----
Plz plz don't buy this phone.
-----
Plz don't buy this phone. Just after 12 day purchase, mobile stopped working. When I visited service centre, service engineer told me that operating system has been corrupted. They update the OS and mobile starts working. Then again after 8 days mobile stopped suddenly. When I visited service centre engineer told me that this mobile has serious issues with OS. Now this time it took 1 week to update. This is ridiculous Samsung. Why New mobile has this much problem. Nobody from Samsung is responding not on mobile or not in email. This is what you called international brand. To hell with that. Plz plz don't buy this set.
-----
Perfect
-----
I used for some photos. It appeared just natural colour And wonderful images. I use multi-tasking without any interption. I am happy with Samsung's Galaxy m31. Battery is really what I was looking for. If you just travel for a couple of days, you really don't need to battery charge. Thanks for a giant battery.
Thanks to seller and Amazon for providing best service and products.
-----
Banger for entertainment purpose and utility.
-----
Well its my first time using a Samsung android phone. To be honest I wasn't expecting that good device. I wanted a phone with good battery with a great display and m31 is a total banger om this one. The battery lasts for 2 days and the amoled screen is amazing. Apart from screen and battery this packs a great deal of utility. Samsung one ui is awesome, tbh I'm loving this. I've played cod and mcoc on this and they run quite smooth.
Talking about some not so exciting feature is camera quality, on paper they look great but in original the camera is less sharp it's beautifys and soften the image. And yes it's little bit chunky in terms of weight. And yes it takes a long time to charge.
Overall its a great deal.
9/10 recommended.
-----
Recommended for Samsung Users
-----
Pros:
One ui 2.0 with android 10
Screen and Camera
Can easily handle day to day task - No issues

Cons:
6000 mah battery performs like a 4500-5000 mah might be because of processor
Charging speed nearly 3 hours
-----
Amazing performance at low budget
-----
After using this phone for a week I am giving this review ( a short review) after viewing this you can really impress with this phone,my observations are:
1.everyone is looking for such a phone with a very good camera quality,in this phone with 64 MP camera the images are really appreciable.
2. Now I come to its battery it has 6000 mah of battery life,which lasts a long ,in my recent days I watch movies,playing games but it doesn't last.
3. Now about its look, very attractive especially it's back with superb camera design .I impressed.
4. With the given processor it doest create any hindrance while using any heavy size gaming app.

So I want to say as I experienced, it is really very impressive with this budget.
-----
Best battery life and nice camera quality and good for watching movies but not supreme for gaming.
-----
6000 mAh  battery  . 32MP  front  camera. 64MP+8MP+5MP+5MP  rear  camera .Also  has  samsung  latest  ui  .  and  6  gb  ram  ,128  gb  storage.  In  16000 rupees ,  you  can't  ask  for  more.  Really , I  like  Samsung galaxy M31 . If  you  are  looking mobile for  watching  series  and  movies , Samsung galaxy M31 is  nice  . If  you  are  looking  for  gaming , Samsung galaxy M31 is  good, although  you  may  look  for  another  smartphones because Snapdragon is better  than Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9611 in  some  points. In  comparision  with  other  samsung  smartphones ,Samsung galaxy M31 has  one  disadvantage  that  Samsung galaxy M31 has  front  gorilla glass  3  and  no  rear  glass  while  some  samsung  phones  have  rear  glass.
-----
Best of best phones under 15000.
-----
I would say this is the best smartphone at around 15000 rupees .
6000mAh battery is its USP. I watched two movies online back to back and still 60% of battery was available. With fast charging 6000mah battery takes a bit time but that is reasnable. 64 MP camera is mind blowing with for different types of camera you can click different  quality images. Its been two days I have bought this phone and surely I am in love with it. 6GB RAM is enough to play any mobile game like ping or free fire or any other.
-----
A very best phone for a long day user. Serves the purpose at its best than any other.
-----
Phone is worth at this price range. Comparing to the phone i have used before like Nokia, the cameras of Samsung galaxy M31 is missing details in the pictures, but is good in low light. Overall the the cameras are really good compared to other Samsung phones in this price range. I love the full black body, when the phone is used in dark screen mode, it absolutely a great feel of having very nice gadget at hand - Hats off to the design here. Ofcourse, the display is superb. And battery life is really a plus on this phone. A great product to own! Though, the charger i recieved in the box is defective, its not working, i had to use my other chargers to charge my phone because i didn't like to exchange my phone just for the defective charger.
-----
Mega monster with in this price range
-----
The phone is great in this price range.
The 4 reason that attracted me to buy this phone is
¬∞ The brand name itself
¬∞ 64 mp mega camera
¬∞ 6000 mAh mega battery
¬∞ Samsung Amoled display

The camera quality is great, i tried slow motion video and the outcome was nice actually.

I bought the 6/128 gb variant, it's pretty good.

2 things i felt bad with in the 3 days is
¬∞ first day itself the phone was getting hot, thats because an update and initial setup of the device
¬∞ I couldn't find the network speed indicator in settings. Because in this internet generation we need to assure that we're getting enough speed for network.

Overall its a mega monster with in this price range.

Galaxy M31 overall is excellent.
Battery üîã brackup is awesome cameras also good but work like 48MP because when i zoomed that time picture going blaring. Speaker  Sounds very  Good. But i need some more develop in software like adding more fingerprint two to three.
Anyways I Give five üåü star out of Five because i share  my feedback with you after 15 days of the purchased. It's my suggestion for you don't buy unknown Brand Galaxy M31 bit all Letest and C*****
Mobile
-----
Everything is Good except onething. Samsung must update this in the coming update.
-----
I have been using this mobile from one month. Below is my review about all the features.

1.Camer Quality is Good
2. Fingerprint reader is so quick
3. Phone display is good
4. Sound system is upto the mark
5. Battery: if you are using continuously, the battery would work upto 1 day.

Con: Only issues that I am facing is,
while using WhatsApp, in middle of a conversation, phone is hanging for 2 mins with no reason. Not sure, what's the problem is but it happend to me many times with in this short time.
I request Samsungs to overcome this issue in the next update.

Heating up issue with mobile
-----
Hi, I have raised a concern already about heating up of device. When I am on call, mobile gets heated up very much and I am facing sever pain below my left ear.
After stating all this over the call (I used my old mobile to call), Amazon team has asked me to do troubleshooting and diagnosed my mobile when I was not using my mobile and  the result showed under control temperature of the device. I am shocked that even I stated so many times about my physical pain, they are not ready to place a request of return/replacement.
I urge you to please support here. I am not able to see any other option to return it.

Going forward, I would not be ordering anything from Amazon and will also suggest my friends and family too.
-----
Great value for money
-----
Looked up many reviews  and purchased Samsung M31 as I was convinced that this is the phone with the most robust battery. Nothing else matters at the end of the day if you don't have  enough charge left. So this phone really fit pls the bill. The photos are crystal clear and the the 4 cameras at the back give you several options for the same.But this phone, shut off the unnecessary notifications,  put a slick black screen to help save your power.The wide Amulet display makes watching movies and ott platforms a pleasure.
The sound from.the speakers are good and equally great on the headphone. Turn on the Dolby atmos if you have to giving you options for music, movies or sports. A great value for money at around 16000 rupees.
-----
One of the best phones available for that price
-----
The specs is incredible on paper and when I bought it and actually tested it, most of the specs hold good. The camera quality and features are very good though it may take some time to focus on the object dynamically. Normal without zoom 64MP shots are amazing and so is Macro &amp; ultra wide. Though when zoomed the quality goes down drastically. Charging speed and battery life are decent enough and haven't seen heating issue until now. The number 6000mah maybe bloated up but the battery performance is good enough for a common user. The AMOLED display, security features and Samsung apps/shop/members are top notch! Overall, the best common use phone you can get for this price.

PS: the metal back of the phone is amazing!
-----
Waste of money...
-----
Camera quality is 3rd class.
64MP is like 06MP &amp; 32MP is like 03MP.
Pixel quality of photo is very bad.
6K monster battery is myth. Battery backup is very poor. 15W charge is very slow.
Face unlock is slow.
Don't buy any mid range phone of Samsung.
It is waste of money.
I want my money back from Amazon.

Brand power only
-----
A handy Handset with good design proportions.

Design wise nothing great

Good camera with Depth, wide angle features.
Night camera is also good for price.

15hrs on screen time with Wi-Fi on.

Battery charging speed is too slow..
0-100 2hrs 45mts.

Network accessibility is less compared to xiomi phones and all
-----
poor quality, used product selling ,,service time not responding amazon is not good
-----
The pros and cons
-----
The phone is 100% value for money but it would have been far better if the Samsung had used good built quality. The finger print reader is working fine. There are so many modes in camera which I think is so cool for clicking pictures and the camera quality is much better. Well you are getting a 6000mAH battery in this one, one shouldn't be complaining about the battery life atleast. The  cons of this phone is that Samsung should have given a higher watt fast charger which is only 15 watt fast charging and the back side of the phone gets scratches all over it if you  clean the phone with a soft cotton cloth only. The backside would have been much better if they have used glass. All over the phone is best in this price range.
-----
Heart winner
-----
I am in love with this model..it's display specially the dark mode is just a killer one..no need to worry about the battery life..it's true that the word monster suits best to this one...even the camera has so many features that one will get so busy with its camera by using just its features and experiencing on it..last one if someone is a movie lover..then they gonna enjoy a lot by its super amoled display experience..

Cellphone not Working
-----
I have M30s cellphone, based on that I have purchased M31 model, but it very poor quality in touch screen and camera. Currently touch screen of the cellphone is not working, with in 1.5 months, I am very disappointment with the quality of the cellphone, in this lock-down situation, How customer care team will help for replacement.

As I am Samsung customer since 18 years, I would like to hear from team immanently for solution.
-----
Not for gamers, who have interested to play heavy games
-----
I am using M31 (6GB,128GB), the performance is good but there is some problems:
1. Experience Heating problem, while playing heavy game like PUBG for more than 1 hour on the upper part of the phone.
2. Sometimes freezing of samsung keyboard.
3. Gyroscope is not much Sensitive as compare to other brand phones.

At last phone is good, not better choice for gamers.
-----
Nice Phone in 15k Segment
-----
üòÄü§óüòçüòòThis phone will definitely a winner under 20k segment phones. My honest review after 4 days usage.

1.Excellent Back &amp; Front Cam, PFA pics here.
2.Display moulded edges &amp; sAMOLED nice.
3.Big Battery, good backup for 2 days with mobile data on.
4.Performance is Above Average i would say. Still i didn't remove the cover so after removing the plastic cover, it would be better..
5.3 slots are sd card.. i bought only 64gb.
6. Normal ram usage is 3gb and 3gb free for heavy users
7.speaker is above avg.
8. Mobile weight is medium and slim.

I will give 4.5 rating. (Finger print could have been moved to front or side). I hope it will long last for 5,6 years...üòçüòòü§ó

Truely a megamonster in terms of feature and such a low pricing.
This is a honest review.
Pro.
1. Amazing battery life.
2. Great camera
3. Nice speed with 6 GB Ram.
4. For storage i got 128GB that too in 15999 loved it.
5. Processor is good unless you are not a hard core mobile gamer.
Cons.
1.Slow charging,samsung could have provided 20+watt charger.
2. Phone heat up after playing game for long duration.

-----
One week review
-----
Okay so I bought the phone on the day it was released. The review is based the first week usage of the phone.
1. Starting big just like it's battery. The 6000 mAh battery last for a day and half on moderate to high usage of the phone.
2. Camera - the quad cam setup impresses more than one can expect, specially the 64 MP mode.
3. The sAMOLED screen is blessing to the eyes. Brightness is no isssue even out in the sun.
4. With it's 6gb ram one can just stop worrying about the lag.
5. Even though it doesn't have a glass back. It still gives a premium feel.

And with the brand like Samsung it is a must go phone under 15k.
-----
Affordable, true powerhouse performer with stunning looks, 64 MP Quad Camera good for all occasions.
-----
Tha Galaxy M31 is probably the greatest piece of design &amp; engineering excellence by the Global Smartphone leader -Samsung for its new/repeat purchase Galaxy users.

Having used the M31 for 5 days now I would love to share my user experience. Every aspect of this phone is unique, the hardware, software and the OS has been engineered par excellence and over delivers on its promise and commitment.

For non Galaxy users possibly this is the best possible opportunity to own this powerhouse phone at such an appealing price point.

Kudos to the Amazon India Team for the Product Management, planning, sales, marketing &amp; logistics support rendered with before time delivery of this amazing product.
-----
Tiktokers here is yours awaited phone in budget.
-----
Should appriciate the effort made by samsung on M31,
If u are a tiktoker, vlogger, camera lover, this phone is for you
There are many phones with good cameras and yes better than Samsung M31 but you will not satisfy as this beast make you satisfy with the features like super slowmo, slowmo, macro, nightmode etc
The best part is, the person who doesn't like his face or he is camera shy and loves doing vlogs, AR emoji will help him to creates his face and you can do video on it.
With AR emoji u can do some awesome tiktok as well.
You can visit my tiktok ID for videos @hemantmachani

Also appriciated Amazon quick delivery, not a prime member but still i received this phone in 2 days.
-----
Excellent  Phone, great price, awesome battery
-----
Excellent price point.
Display is excellent.
Very fast processor.
Fingerprint reader is fast and accurate for the price point.
Camera is excellent. Sharp and accurate colors and image reproduction.
Battery Life is awesome. It lasts about 18 hours on hevay usage.
Microphone placement is some issue. Many times finger accidentally covers it, leading to voice not reaching the person at other end of call. One has to be very careful not to cover the microphone accidentally.

A good budget phone - M31

-----
Stay away from this mobile
-----
I regret buying this mobile. it is much slower then my earlier samsung in nxt mobile. Also on this phone the network bar for vodafone network shows only 2 lines whereas on my other mobile it shows full network of vodafone. Worst phone . I suggest people not to go for this phone. It is definitely not a 6 gb ram phone. It is only on papers not actual.
-----
Budget beast
-----
Everything perfect and better than previous m30s.
Camera is awesome as usual in samsung display quality at this price..no words to say
Thank you samsung

Best Smartphone in India for 2020
-----
The Galaxy M31 turned out to be the most value-for-money budget phone from the Korean giant.
Samsung has once again focused on battery capacity as one of the highlights. The Galaxy M31 has a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, the biggest we‚Äôve ever seen on any Galaxy phone, no matter which price segment it may fall in. The other notable feature on the M31 is a 64MP primary rear camera.
The Galaxy M31 also comes with a number of other camera features, like AR Emoji, Super Slow-mo video recording, a regular slow motion mode, and a Super Steady mode that uses the ultra-wide cameras to record action camera-like videos with reduced shake.

I love it .
Thanks Samsung and Amazon
-----
Value for money product, features available at this cost is wow
-----
Like:
Value for money
Camera quality is good
Selfie camera is nice
Battery is excellent
Display supercool
Storage of128gb is giving much much comfort.
Screen size is good for viewing videos and reading as well.

Dislike:
Image processing can be improvised
4G LTE data streaming not smooth as expected. Even though we have excellent data connection video stream's buffering or cache is not faster.
-----
Good phone
-----
At this price and brand like Samsung is a good deal.  Also it is Made in India.

Above features and quality. I am using Apple 10 XS. Samsung A31 is really packed with loads of quality and features at this price. I am not comparing Samsung to Apple but price to features here.
-----
Worth For Money...
-----
Phone was too good and worth for its price.. I'm writing this review after using the phone for more than a month.. till now no issues with its battery life.. I think the time period which I used is enough to make conclusion about battery and coming to screen resolution, camera quality, sound quality, performance, browsing efficiency.. everything was good till now.. the only thing I miss was earphones and protective case.. it would be very appreciative if Samsung provides earphones and protective case like how vivo is providing.. other than that no issues.. I was happy with the mobile!!!
-----
M31 value for money, but can get better. Released in a hurry.
-----
Heat at the top-back of the phone sometimes, but not unbearable,  just get scared as you're gonna have to put it over the ear.
Camera is good, a little smudgy on zoom, but captures good light and colors.
Battery backup on medium use good, full charge gives a day and a half.
Sleek in the hand.
Lag in scrolling apps even with 6+128GB is noticeable.
Wi-fi-Calling very helpful.
Product info said it had sim card pin, but box did not.
Too many system updates within first 2 days of using. Some apps crashed.
So happy to have a good camera smartphone but I believe it can be better with the 15k budget.

Not up to the mark
-----
Camera quality is very poor, 64mp image is just a joke. Mi note 8 pro has better image quality compared to this phone. Do not believe paid product reviews.
Display is good and mobile is light weight though it has 6000mah battery.
-----
Go for it...
-----
Short and crispy way :-
Pros -
1. Battery backup is like 2 days if you run daily activities which is very much required
2. Phone is lighter even we have a massive battery inside
3. If you have samsung forget about screen.. its always awesome.
4. Fingr print and face unlock is quite smooth without any hiccups

Cons:-
1. Charging is slow with 15W charger
2. Sluggish in multitasking even in 6gb

Overall its a nice package at this price range
-----
Good specs in the given price
-----
Galaxy M31's camera sure lives up to my expectations. The picture quality in low light is awesome and the phone is comparatively light given the battery capacity. It took around 2.5 hours for a full charge and lasted for roughly 1.5 day on my normal usage. However, I'm a bit disappointed with the lack of IR blaster and One UI. One UI doesn't have out of the box support for things like internet speed meter and number of fingerprints that can be registered is limited to 3. Overall it's a good purchase within given price, especially if you're a camera fanatic.
-----
Amazing product on Amazon
-----
I am using this phone from 06/03/2020. I was on tour from 07/03/2020, so I want a new mobile phone, therefore, I selected M31 phone among many new mobile launched at that time on Amazon and other platforms.  Thank you to Amazon who delivered the product timely before proceeding to your. I made my tour memorable with this Phone after capturing good quality of camera, videos etc.
-----
Do Not Go For It !
-----
Ok first of all.
1.Do not buy the phone as they have mentioned 6000Mah Mega Battery.The battery works just half a day and is so normal. It's not even fast charging.
2.Do not even think of a good front camera.
3. The charger is not a fast charger.
Do not go for this for 16k.
4. Rest some of the features are okie.
5. Would be better if I get refund.
-----
Best in class handset.
-----
Awesome design of mobile, camera quality very impressive. Good to handle the 64 megapixels quad camera performs a great job
And the best part is it support wifi calling it also inbuilt with dark mode. And the most striking feature is you can popup many small windows and do multitasking which is very convenient Really great job by Samsung üëç

Everything checks out and you get a wonderful phone
-----
This Phone (Samsung Galaxy M31 6 GB+128GB) has got everything, can even punch above its weight.
No performance issues, Samsung's sAMOLED display looks the best (simply better than others), battery easily lasts a day with constant use. Cameras take great photos too.
One UI 2.0 is beautiful, lovely to use.
Overall it has been a great purchase. Great Work, Samsung.
-----
Samsung - A mega mega monster
-----
Phone is very good to use. Camera is really is awesome. M31 is really worth a try at this cost. It has variant features. So lets talk about pros and cons
Pros
1.Camera- When I compared it with S10, M31 is superb
2.Battery-Lasts almost 2days of general use for completecharge
3.Display- Refreshin rate is really good and no lagging

Cons
1. Processor - They could have improved the processor. The only drawback i find in samsung phone is that heating issues.
2. Speaker - speaker is not upto a great effect
3. Fingerprint - They could have launched with in display sensor

Without these cons the really awesome and its a megamonster

Samsung M31 review. Go for it.
-----
Bought it on the launch hour. I am rating this after using it for more than two weeks. It is worth your money. I think, Samsung cameback  with a bang. Awesome  speck in this range. Don't waste your money choosing other vendors.
Both sides  Camera's are stunning.
Sound quality is very good.
Battery backup is coming for 2 days.
Initially felt bit heavy ..but now I am okay with it.
No lags at all.
 Just go for it...

The best budget phone ever
-----
This is by far the best budget smartphone I've ever used.The camera quality is amazing.The night mode on the phone works really well and it has various camera modes which are great.The gaming is also really good on this phone.Games like ping and cod work really well even on high frame rate.The battery is surely unbelieveable.The phone lasts for a long time and its cooling technology is also great.Video resolution on various OTT platforms is quite good.The charger of the phone is 15w and charges the phone at a great speed.Overall,if you're looking for a budget smartphone in the price range of 12000-18000 this is the best choice.
-----
Worse experience with Samsung.üòî
-----
This phone has worse camera in slow motion. After that 6000 mah battery is fake thing it seems to be 4000 only. And in the last but not the least u cant hear other person voice while u r doing calls. Its my worse experience for samsung phone.
-----
Good Mobile
-----
The camera of this phone is really nice.The display of this mobile is also very good. I recommend this mobile to everyone who is in search of a phone with a good camera.The weight of this phone is also quite low. The only thing which did not meet expectations is the battery. Even though it states that it has a 6000mAh battery , it doesn't last for too long.
-----
Samsung now not expensive but extraordinary compare to other brands
-----
First of all
 thanks to amazon for speedy delivery service every time I love it.

SAMSUNG GALAXY M31 mobile is

multiple combo for every feature like

Great Battery life 2 days minimum.
Camera quality to much.
Speed performance like rocket.
Design look simple but effective.
Last not least amoled display like seven wonder color quality.
Finger print very fast.

Overall I am fully satisfied with Samsung.
And I am purchased Samsung very long time but this time Samsung give me lot of quality of product in normal price..

Thanks Samsung

Samsung M31 review after a week.
-----
This phone has Very good display. Sound quality is decent. Camera is awesome I have clicked few pictures in day light and it's Very good but night mode can be updated. Battery is excellent and in day to day life phone is very easy to use and doesn't feel heavy. Thanks to the Samsung UI it's clean and simple with gestures. Over all this is a media phone. I faced little lag but not very often. Performance is good. I will recommend people who have heavy media consumption they should definitely buy this phone.
-----
Value for money
-----
In this price range it's best mobile

My ratings (out of 5) are as below basis I used so far

Display - 5
Bettary - 5
Camera - 4 but nice in thi price
Finger touch - 5
Sensitivity - 5
Performance - 5

Overall must buy if you have 15k budget and I recommend to buy along with insurance
-----
Wowwww mobile...
-----
Superb mobile.. best mobile in this price range, best display, battery, camera and design, all too good.. must buy.. satisfaction guaranteed
I use this mobile last 5 days I fully satisfied,  I really don't care about charging my mobile because it stands more than 2 days with high usage of internet and gaming.
Only one negative I noticed is mobile is having heating issues while play game and charging but not too much,  this is so little while comparing to other mobiles like Asus zenfone.
I'll give 9.9 out of 10... that missing one is for heating issues otherwise I love this mobile.
Believe me Samsung never miss to impress you.
Thanks friends bye....üòá

M31 Experience
-----
The mobile is beyond my expectation except in one thing. It has good camera quality when you take photos in good lighting. And the night mode is above the average. Sound quality, I found it to be very good in all the aspect. Display, very good quality. Battery life, it does worth very much to wait for 2.5 Hr charging time as it last for more than one and half day for the moderate users. By the way I didn't check if it really takes 2.5 Hr to charge up. I just go by the reviews which claims the same.

And finally that one thing which has disappointed me is that this model don't have inbuilt music player.
-----
***Nice phone***
-----
* Nice Display
* Good battery backup
* Nice Camera
* handy
* Perfect for users who use their phone for calling, navigation , taking photos and all daily needed apps.
Below are few things I have observed so far.
- Taking time to get it's battery fully charged.
  6000mAH battery  could  be the reason it.
- Not getting  a perfect screen gaurd so far. Looks like it will take some time
Over all good phone to have  :)
-----
Fantastic four a mature user
-----
Samsung mobile are for mature people like from 28yrs and above, who don't game like teenagers.
Best screen
Best ui exp
Mature user doesn't push a mobile to its processing limits so its good if u r not a gamer like me, and good screen gives u pleasure every time u look at it.
Good camera, not outstanding, but good for social media uploads, night cam is not good, but we rarely photograph during night

Budget phone with "budget" options
-----
Fingerprint sensor needs to be more robust. Battery charging time is more even though claimed to be fast charging. There are very many options as double tap sleep which is not available here, whereas in similar price range phones we get lot of options/features. One important thing is the charger cable length is too short, not up to the standards of Samsung. Samsung - if you are unable to provide decent features/options in this price range, please don't roll out mobiles here and downgrade your standard.
-----
Wrost phone ever.
-----
Don't buy this rubbish phone ever samsung is now going on same china way thay are cheating with customers. Battery only 3000 mh instead of 6000 mh it's automatically darin out in one night. Camera so poor as comparison of other phones. So please don't buy .
-----
It worth the price
-----
I really like the camera. The battery life was very good .It took me around 2 days to completely discharge the battery.The amoled screen was like cherry on the top of cake .They only complain I have is there is a minor lag in viewing the picture after taking a snap .It takes a pause of 2-3 sec which was bit unusual for me because  the phone performance was very good and  It is very fast . The other thing is there is no stabilization in macro mode and the night mode is pretty good  (it's  not very good ).Ignoring these minor defects  ...the phone is all in all very good .I'm satisfied  with it.The delivery by Amazon was fast and the phone was neatly  packed .
-----
Charging issue
-----
Disappointed with charging time. it takes around 5 hours to full charge, not a fast charging.
-----
Superb

*The Battery Backup is too good in this price.
*Sree Resolution and Screen Presence is Excellent.
*Fast fingerprint and Face Recognition is beyond imagination.

*Adapt to all Gaming modes.
Cons.

But the overall rating from me is 4.5 out of 5. The Product is way beyond excellent in this price range.

Poor experience with samsung M31
-----
1)Totally disappointed with this product.
Two weeks before I bought samsung m31, Facing issue from the day 1. Frequently its shows a popup with "No sim card inserted" but when I restart the phone it works good for sometime.
2)Mobile is filled with Ads, Worst user experience
3)Front camera- poor quality
Please dont buy this product.
Need refund
-----
No battery life
-----
Battery life is not good definitely there is not  6000 mah battery fitted it's pure false information.
While received  call touch screen not  working  properly
Totally not good mobile
 In each field this mobile is not good
-----
Not Bad but
-----
Camera quality is very good but at the low light front and back camera performance are not good...
Display is amezing...
Battery is good but its charging time is very bad....(0% to 100% charging time = 2:30+ hours)....(work 1.2 or 1.5 days at normal uses)
Fingerprint work fast but sometime it's not work... you need to clean your hand and then try...
This phone is not for a gamers ...
This is for a normal user...
I am a normal user... and i write this review after 50 days of use....
Otherwish this phone is the best phone for Samsung Lover....
If you not a gamer and need a good phone for normal uses thn try it üòä
-----
Good phone for people who are looking for good battery and camera
-----
Pros:
1. 6000 mah battery is good.
2. Camera is awesome, mainly wide angle shots are superb
3. Previously I didn't use Samsung, I don't know about its display. But now I'm using it and sAMOLED display is awesome.
4. Dolby audio is available for earphones.
5. Android 10 is available.
6. Heat dissipation is less.
7. I bought 128GB version, and in that 116GB is available for me.
8. For full charge it is taking 2 - 2 and half hours.
Cons:
1. As the phone is having single speaker, so Dolby audio not available without earphones.

As I don't play games, so I don't think processor bothers me much.

Awesome mobile in this prize range..
-----
This mobile is awesome......no heating problem any game play like pubg etc..
Build quality excellent.
Design good....
-----
Best camera, battery, and fluent one UI 2.0
-----
Really this phone has monstrous battery, gives almost 2 -2.5 days power backup and phone has best camera available within this price range tooks awesome pics and the most highlighted thing about this phone is it's super AMOLED screen...woow Samsung cudos.
Many people and yotube reviewer constantly cursing it's exynos 9611 processor but believe me man this processor is very powerful..dude it's Samsung they know how to tune it's own processor to work fluently with it's one UI 2.0 so this was from my end.
And please don't compare this phone with Chinese phone.(oppo, vivo, Corona"xiaomi" etc.)
-----
Attractive.
-----
Good mobile.Camera could be better.Atractive design.But
battery drains very fast.In standby position also it comes from 100% to 80% within 8 hrs.
-----
Not Happy with charging time or battery backup
-----
My views may change over time, but as of now not happy with battery backup or charging time.

I was switching from xiaomi to Samsung as my company apps dont support xiaomi.

But so far not happy with supposedly fast charging of Samsung.

My MI Note 4 that is 3 years old charges faster than this brand new phone.

Also my old MI Note 4 phone that is just 4000 Mah had power backup for 2 days initially when I bought it.
I don't see any improvement in the new 600Mah phone with same set of apps installed. Not sure where the extra
2000Mah charge is wasted
-----
Samsung galaxy m31 - the best smartphone at very affordable price
-----
Great battery life...stand by more than two days.... great audio quality.  Multiple functions and hang-free usage.
Camera quality is absolutely mindblowing...not just the rear 64mp quadcam even the front cam is awesome.
Fingerprint reader is comparitviley superb in its quality and functionality.
Nice display and very handy smartphone.
Just go for Galaxy M31 - it's a beautiful piece of tech...!
-----
Do not Buy
-----
Do not buy if u want peace of mind. good battery , good display and performance. But it drives me crazy whenever I use it even feel like breaking it. Every Time makes a call it go to auto hold minimum two times and every time it goes to auto record . It  drives you crazy . Samsung should stop making such technological nuisance. Really a piece of crap. I need my money back
-----
Best phone of 2020
-----
Such a awesome phone at a good price. The battery is big beast and even camera can be seen like fabulous, images are such a beast one's and night shot is lit. I loved this phone and everyone should read this review and should buy this mega monster. Pros: 1. Good camera 2. Big battery Even it lasts 3 days and for standby it may lasts for 5 to 6 days 3. Big storage 4. Super amoled display is lit. 5. For gaming its beastPUBG works like cool on this one ,even on hdr ultra settings i got no frames drop. 6. One UI 2.0 is best UI in this category. Cons: 1. Slightly heats up while charging. I'll declare that this phone is the best phone at this range.
-----
Very good in this budget, but both camera performence is not upto the mark.
-----
Phone performance is really very good, not stacking or hanging during multiple app operation. Battery is also very good. But the camera 64MP is not up to the mark compared to oppo/vivo 48MP. But camera is good.
SAR value is very low and its a very good point to buy this mobile. Overall very good mobile phone  in this budget.
-----
After 10 days of use
-----
It's been only 15 days and the device not working. I got it delivered on 16/03/2020 , 3 days back i  wrote a review in which i gave 5 star now changing it to 1 star. today near about 2pm the screen of the device stop working, everything seems fine except the device is not responding to touch, it is still in such a mode that i am not able to use it. I did a factory reset but the problem has not solved, now right side touch works intermittently and the left side is not working at all. it has no damage on display but its not working. I am regretting that i bought this phone. I should have given 0 star not unfortunately that option is not available.
-----
Great deal in this price range
-----
You can just tap the finger to register your print and the phone unlocks lightning fast.

As far as the cameras are concerned, the Samsung Galaxy M31 on the rear packs a 64-megapixel primary camera with an f/1.8 aperture; a second 8-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture; a third 5-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a fourth 5-megapixel camera with an f/2.4 aperture. The rear camera setup has autofocus. It sports a 32-megapixel camera on the front for selfies, with an f/2.0 aperture.

This phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery.

Really Monster
-----
I am really satisfied with this phone, excellent battery backup. Now I don't need to carry charger. Awesome camera on this price. Video quality is amazing.

Overall, one of the best phone I have.

One problem I found is the back panel it is of plastic and you need to take extra care of it... I was waiting for best back cover but till then I have my phone got multiple rashes on back panel.
And one thing is that, phone is getting on hold mode during the call. This is because, option button is getting eneble on right up side during call and accidentally it's getting touch.

But Still I am happy what I got.
-----
Best phone in just Rs. 15000
-----
It is a best phone in the range of 15000. Fingerprint reader of m31 is great it just takes a moment after touching your finger to the sensor. Its battery is awesome, I can't believe that it has 6000 mAH battery. Camera is mind blowing, 64 MP camera in such a low price. What more I say about m31.... Thank you Samsung for manufacturing this device in such low price.
-----
Faulty handset received
-----
It was good for about 10 days thereafter there are many issues. Everyday new prob n I am unable to take this to nearby samsung galaxy center as all shops are closed due to corona. Last 3 days it was restarting after every 5 min then I did factory data reset twice but issue did not solved. Then again there is issue with speaker. If i get any call phone doesnt ring even full volume is on. If i answer or make any call unable to listen to the person on the other side of the phone. No video n no music as if it has gone mute.
-----
Great Phone with massive battery and sAMOLED
-----
I bought this as it was completing my smartphone specification needs.
Loved camera and audio quality when I use video recording.
From my point of view getting sAMOLED and 64 MP quad camera setup at this price point is a steal deal.

When it comes to some more needful things, I would love it if it comes with in display fingerprint reader and charging adapter with more output for fast charging because it takes time to charge massive 6000 mAh battery which I took one or one and half day to drain after office uses and PUBG session.

Talking about design it feels sleek and premium because of shiny finish.
-----
Worth for money
-----
Those who are looking for multimedia. This phone worth.
Pros.
Display 9/10 Display is one the major positive inthis phone
Battery 9/10
Software 9/10 Andriod 10 getting seamless experience..
Camera 8/10 getting accurate &amp; true color what u see in ur eyes. Same colory reproductive Daylights only...
Fingerprint 8/10 very quick &amp; responsive.
Processor : 7/10 Day to day no laggy at all. Am not testing gaming.. Aprat from which is very quick &amp; fast.

Cons:
Camera :4/10 very worst processing.
Getting lot of noise produce in low light.
Gcam port is not available for exynos processor.

Galaxy M31 review after 15 days of usage
-----
Good Smartphone, looks great when not using any back cover. Battery is awesome. Display is good and crisp. Camera is good though a bit disappointed on picture comparison with other smartphone within range as colors are little offtone. May be have not much clicked photo in daylight bright condition where clicks can be taken for any occasion or photography can be done.
Good features like dark mode,Dolby atmos, smart view. Camera macro shot is amazing.
Back panel attracts fingerprints.
Overall good phone.
-----
Fantastic mobile!
-----
I am a fan of Samsung mobile. Earlier I had Samsung on8 phone which was good. I wanted a phone with a large display and large storage. So I decided to go for Samsung m31. This is the best mobile at this rate. Display is great, camera is good with good pictures. Capacitive touchscreen is smooth, fingerprint scan is great, face detection is good, quality of phone is good and lightweight. Battery is superb. Phone does not heat too much but I am not sure about gaming which I do no use much. Connectivity is great as well. So if you want a mobile with these kind of features then go for this.
-----
Amazingly superb but with some minor flaws !
-----
The Camera Quality is really good but I hope there could have been more options in the camera settings and the fingerprint reader is quite quick and efficient and the full HD full screen display is too good for viewing videos , shows, films etc . What is Dislike is the battery which could have been better. The battery power is said to be 6000 mah but it isn't lasting for a day sometimes . The Battery is draining a bit fast while using mobile data or Wifi ! Overall I would rate this phone 4 out of 5 stars ! Thank you for this amazing product ! The Operating system is quite good but almost similar to the previous samsung smartphones.
-----
Mega battery mega gaming and great camera amazing display m31 is love ü§©ü§©
-----
Samsung galaxy m31 is a great package for the people who are on there mobile phone all day . There are many things that I like one is the super amoled display the battery and pubg for 6h a day it supports the highest graphics setting in pubg and smooth experience in day to day use . I think its the best phone in this budget segment. Not only this how can I forget the camera which is fantastic the wide angle shots and the 64 mp main shooter it amazing the picture didn't need and editing.  I am using this device since it was launched and now it is 2 weeks no issue at all . I hope you will like my review and suggest this  phone to you
-----
Best mobile in M series, and worth it at this price range.
-----
Mobile is nice.. Specially quad Camera. If portrait images are so awesome. Camera night mode is much better than other mobiles of this range. Battery backup is good. Finger print is nice. I think in M series this is the best mobile. Gaming experience  like punh is also very impressive on this processor. Overall mobile is worth it on this price.

An average phone with nothing as said in the promotions.
-----
System:
System UI Stopped - my phone encounters this issue often and gets shut down in the mid of a phone call or at times of camera usage and restarts after a couple of long minutes. Moreover, the phone gets heated up too often with minimal usage of surfing (no gaming).
Camera: Not as promised. Not worth a single rating as the pictures are distorted when taken at night.
64MP (no zoom ) fails in comparison to a 16MP cam quality ....the picture taken are sharp and blurred when zoomed.
The only good thing is fast charging and battery life. Overall M31 is an average phone with nothing as promised by Samsung.
-----
Very bad phone bad service from amazon
-----
Very bad phone, heating issue, battery  changing  takes 5 hour to charge fully, contacted technical  support team, they said reset the phone, after reset same problem is there, I want my money back, very bad experience
with Amazon  , they're fooling by saying blancco diagnostics to install the app in there phone
-----
Super awesome display &amp; battery life
-----
General review - If you are looking for mobile which would long last without further then your search ends here . Because it's battery life is better than anyone in market.

Battery life - best in market

Sound - not laudable but good quality sound

Screen - awesome full screen display

Fingerprint reader  - would have been great if it had screen inline touch otherwise back screen touch is also fast.

Camera quality - good camera quality but best thing is its wide angel view.

I was iPhone user but after looking at its feature I want to say big thanks to Samsung.
-----
Excellent phone within buget
-----
Excellent phone in budget. I used M30s previously I am not satisfied with camera on M30s. That has been taken care in this M31 and even the speed on the phone is also improved.This has the latest android which is a plus. You can tight away but this phone. Forgot to mention battery, super battery with more than 1 and half day backup.
-----
Only battery life is best rest is wrost  and price is high in this range
-----
This camera quality is not 64mp.  It is 8 mp quality.
This 64 mp camera in 3:4 ratio and available for zoom and flash. In night the camera is useless.
Battery life is best . It take 2.5 hrs to full battery from 0% to 100%.
You can buy this phone for battery life only.
If you think about camera then plz go another mobile.
In short -
‚Ä¢Battery = 5/5
‚Ä¢Rear Camera = 1/5 (64 MP)
‚Ä¢Selfie canera= 4/5
‚Ä¢fingerprint  = 4/5
‚Ä¢Screen view = 4/5

Finally  price is high of this specification phone.
Price should be capped rs. 12999/- .
Samsung and Amazon shame on you.

Best Of The Best

I post This Review after Using 3weeks. This is the Best Mobile in this Budget.
# Battery is Good. NO Heating Issue. Charging  Fastely
# camera Quality Is Awesome
# Storage: I'm Using 128 GB.  Buying 128 GB is Better than 64, Because Of it's high Camera Quality  The Pictures are so clear with Large size. So Definitely 128Gb is Best For Photo  lovers.
# One Of The LATEST Android OS Version
# Color : I'm Using Ocean Blue. Its Looks So Royal.... It's so Stylish Than I expected.
I'm so Satisfied with This Color Too.
 # Display : So Good
Over All This Is The Best Mobile In This Price

Monster Power - SAMSUNG M31
-----
Thank you Samsung for coming with this good product, and coming to the review part the major reason I needed to shift to a new phone was the battery, and while travelling this was my greatest hurdle to ensure the battery doesn‚Äôt drain out till I reach Home. Hopefully the monster 6000 Mah battery saves my day. The power packed quad camera also gives an edge over me while clicking pictures at various light condition. The biometrics is functioning smoothly and backed by a good User interface. The system is powerful and smooth and yes I loved it.
-----
Wonderful product at this price
-----
I bought SAMSUNG GALAXY M31  SPACE BLACK  6/64 about a week ago. It was good and performance also good but the fingerprint sensor not reading properly. I am getting little trouble with it. Have to clean properly every time. And the camera at this price is too high. Mostly battery life, Mega Monster for a reason. You can't get a mobile with this features at this price. And I love the design of it, light weight cool looks don't even need a back cover the glass was soo hard and smooth. Quality of the sound is good when playing music. The DOLBY ATMOS working perfectly when you use earphones. Totally satisfied with this.

Both front and back camera quality is very good, in night mode it capture better image than other mobile.
Front camera also support wide angle and slow motion video recording.
6000 mh battery is very good.
Display quality is awesome.
No heating problem.
It may b best if it comes with a charger of 28 wats.
Processor is also good.
Overall in this price it is a better option to by m31
-----
Waste of money, lots of issues with this Phone even you will not get support from samsung.
-----
I am giving 1 star as I Dislike this Phone, I have got the phone 1 month back and I got android update when I updated now this is showing issue "downloading.. don't turn off the target".
As per instruction I have tried with pressing down key and power button but this issue is not yet fixed.
Tried contacting samsung support and they informed this is known issues " OS needs to be reinstalled" at service center.

Heavy heating problem.
Network issue.
Downloading issue from play store.

I recommend don't go with samsung product or with this product, totally waste of money.
-----
Really Not happy with the product
-----
Phone hangs and some times Apps are hanging. Not able to open apps like WhatsApp or games. I need to restart the phone multiple times. Phone gets heated up and charging very slowly. don't know if this is only with my phone or with every buyer of this product. Amazon gave just 10 days of replacement, which isn't sufficient for an end customer to come back on the product, if it is faulty.
It's just not even a month after buying this phone and really struggling with this now. regret a lot about buying this product now.
Can Samsung or amazon do anything for this to resolve my problem? Can they help me?

All about SAMSUNG M31 smartphone.

Product is to good and meet's the user expectation. The #megamonster is not only a tagline, It's also fulfills the customer needs. The super-Amoled display is also good in this device. From my perspective the device is to good for customer as this device provide all the features like 64MP(main camera) + 8MP(depth camera) + 5MP(macro camera) + 5MP(wide-angle camera), all useful sensor's,  long lasting battery backup and sAmoled display.

Samsung M31 : Awesome mobile in the price range.
-----
An awesome phone for the price paid. Got it delivered within one day of placing the order. The M31 has a pretty interesting four camera set up on the back and the selfie shooter too is decent but the main focus has always been on the 6000 mAh battery which hopefully will last 2 days. This is the main advantage

I am very much impressed with Samsung M31 by its look and design.

By the way, the Super AMOLED screen is GORGEOUS.

 The battery life is really amazing on this phone. Even after playing heavy games for long and watching videos with heavy usage, the battery lasts 2 days.
-----
Excellent  in this price range with few cons.
-----
Good display,  although  6.4 inch but compact  design,  fits in one hand.
Review  after  1 month of use,
1.Good battery  life, last for 2 days.
2. Display  good.
3.camera ok . Expected more.
Cons.
1 No dedicated screen shot function.
2. Some time lags.
3. Heating on watching  full movies.
4.No earphones is big cons in this price range.

Samsung m31 review
-----
This Samsung m31 is just awesome, I specially loved the wide angle option.And it just easily connects with our samsung smart TV, today is 27.3.2020 the quarantine day past 3 days we were at home watching  movies through smart view ,we enjoyed it.i think it's a awesome budget Mobile and I love the design, color combination is stunning and I was playing free fire for nearly two hours, it just took 20 percent of the battery it also can be used as a gaming device. Speaker was stunning. And front camera was nice ,I think it would be a great phone for vloggers, I suggest that every one can buy this mega monster.
-----
Review after using it for a week
-----
Camera is really good. Both the front and rear camera.
Display is absolutely stunning. SAMOLED display.
Battery life is incredible and battery saving option works totally great. Used it for a full day and battery was still at 60% with saver on.
Phone audio is crisp and nice. Performance of the phone is also very good I frequently use a bunch of apps together and play games too, it does not lag. The best thing about M31 is it's User Interface. It's clean and simple unlike other UIs like MiUi which is totally trash. There aren't any bloatwares in the phone.
Overall a perfect phone 10/10.
-----
An overall complete package in this price point with Exceptional Camera and battery life.
-----
Have been using M31 for a week now.
It is everything you need from a ‚Çπ15000 phone.
-An amoled display showing accurate colors.
-Exceptionally large battery, can easily go through a day even with wifi on.
- It has a good solid built quality .
- Best thing about this phone is its camera. Which produces accurate colors and take amazing pictures.
Will recommend this to anyone who wishes to spend this much on a mid range phone.
In comparison to other brands I chose samsung beacuse of Samsung's deliverance of a quality product and good chain of serivce centres across my state.

Good phone
-----
Overall, good phone in its price bracket. Stand out features would be Super Amoled screen and massive battery which lasts day and a half with more than normal use. Samsung brand backing is an added advantage. Camera performance is very good in proper lighting conditions. No lag noticed even after loading bunch of apps. It would be interesting to see if it can give same performance after 6 months of usage.

Final verdict: Go for it if you are not an heavy gamer and high quality basic requirements (screen, camera, battery) in limited budget are your priority. You will not regret your decision.
-----
Great Value for money
-----
Reviewing this phone after 20 days of heavy use.
The looks,display, camera, battery life of this phone is really good.

I am not a heavy gamer but the limited no. Of games of Pubg etc.I played in these 20 days, the performance seemed to be alright.

The phone audio is loud and proper but it could have been louder, the voice output in earphones very loud though.

It is a really good purchase in 16k. Value for money.
-----
This time Samsung
-----
This is a wonderful product from Samsung.I was using Mi for last 7 years.But now with this phone Samsung Blake me dump Mi and go with M31.
Pros.
1.Excellent display sAmoled screen is far superior than IPS LCD
2.Android 10
3.Gigantic Battery 6000 May
4.Excellent camera with 4k
5.Samsung brand Name
6.Budget friendly

Cons.
1.Nothing much

Those who are looking for a phone with excellent screen,brand value and decent performance go for it..
-----

Full paisa vasul smart phone
-----
Samsung m31 is an full combo smart phone . I'm using this phone last 15days. And i really satisfied from this phone. Man highlight of samsung m31 is 6000mah battery.  Samsung m31 give 2days of battery backup. About the camera , there is 64+8+5+5 rear cemara and 32mp selfi camera. Camera performance is 10 on 10 there is one special thing is food mood , super slow motion and 64mp camera give detailed photos. Here i'm put some samples photos.One of the most amazing feature is superamoland display which one you never get any other phone on this budget. End of the end this phone is full paisa vasul phone
-----
Best 6000 mah battery upto its name. I am loving it. My friends are also planning to buy
-----
Frankly, I like its battery, RAM, and the color variant. I am a big fan of samsung mobiles. What I dislike is personal. I am bored of using same buttons in settings. Else no major flaw. I searched 6000 MAH battery but only samsung gave me the choice. Only for a change one can replace samsung otherwise it is the best. Good feature is cartoon characters replaces your face in AR emoji I enjoyed it. Palm selfie feature us awesome as usual. I am not camera frenzy although when we took pics others were envious because all others cameras were at flaw and samsung M31 is winner. They my friends deleted my pics in jealousy :-) I am loving it more day in day out
-----
All hype about 64mp camera
-----
There are features in the phone which are disabled. Slowmo &amp; super slowmo recording are not clear even with proper lighting. Normal camera recording not gr8,
my J5 Prime did a better job. This phone has not lived up to expectation. Extremely disappointed.
-----
Mega monster M31 is best smartphone by best company Samsung in this range.
-----
The phone mega monster is superb phone in this range. Here are highlighted pros &amp; cons points.
PROS:-
1) Camera quality is fantastic 64 MP camera is performing great.
2) Battery life is better. 6000mah is quite efficient.
3)face lock and fingerprint sensor is supper fast.
4) Super amoled screen provide you real experience of 4k video.

CONS:-
The only cons I have noticed in this phone after 20 days of use is charging is slow in comparison of other fast charging phone. But this is not a big issue for me.

I feel happy with Mega Monster M31 phone.
-----
Great phone at a reasonable price.
-----
Great product at this price. The camera is really amazing and the picture quality is great as well. 6000 mah battery also lets you use the phone without any boundaries. Fingerprint reader is also quick in response. The phone is sleek and looks good too.

Defective product received.  Battery Backup and lens cover is defective
-----
I got damaged product.  I'm not getting battery Backup even if I'm not using my phone. Camera lens glass is damaged. It can be seen only if we observe properly.  No scratches or any Mark's are not detected but the lens cover is defective. Battery Backup is much lesser than my old phone having 3000 mah. I'm tired to return the product.  Samsung checkup app not finding my issue. I tried to contact Samsung care and Amazon service but not connecting
-----
Pathetic
-----
Product sent,  found scratches on body !! Battery draining fast!!
-----
Very very very worst worst phone
-----
DON'T BUY THIS PHONE, DON'T BUY THIS PHONE, DON'T BUY THIS PHONE, I just bought this phone march 22-2020, This phone going to switch off automatically, it will take 20 min to switch on, i have faced this situation 2times in a week, Camera quality is not good, can improve, steadymode is worst quality. Screen resolution is excellent, battery life is wonderful,very very over heating in video call,  overall this is very very worst phone, s DON'T BUY THIS PHONE, PLS DON'T BUY THIS PHONE
-----
Superb phone in this price range
-----
Superb.... best phone in this price range and specially for samsung lovers... perfect in all parameters, both front and back camera is ultimate with aperture of 1.8, Battery 6000 MAH, Full HD super amoled display, RAM 6 GB internal 128 GB is more than sufficient for gaming also....

Also design, size and other outer paramerets are also very good
-----
Amazing I love it
-----
Amazing smartphone at this price. I used it more than 10 days. It has fabulous. Amazing battery backup. Amazing camera. I love it. This is also liked my friends. Amazing üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòò I love you Samsung for gave this lovely gift.
-----
Best deal for the buck yet does the job.
-----
Overall the phone is good, but seems a little laggy, experienced screen blackout for the second time in my 15day usage, camera performs fantastic offers a great tone balance but struggles indoors in super steady mode, yet great details captured by 64&amp;32mp lenses. The super amoled panel is the might of the phone with perfect viewing angles. The battery lasts for a full 2days with heavy usage.
If compared with vivo v1x pertaining to internet speed when using browser and downloading apps m31 is a lot slower in terms of downloading as compared to vivo both running on jio sim &amp; same plans.
-----
Failure of update resulted in crash of software
-----
Hi,last night(10th April) I was prompted and asked to update software, while doing it update failed, software might have crashed, not able to even re start or reboot phone, AVB failed error is showing on screen.
-----
Good phone but performance not as expected
-----
Phone performance detoriated within 2 months from purchase. As the memory is filled 32GB out of 128 GB available, the phone response has drastically reduced. Specifically face recognition, finger print sensing, switching between Apps etc.
Also not happy with camera quality (though I'm not an expert but when I capture normal clicks without any settings, quality is not so good which we expect from a 64 MP camera)
Battery performance is good till now. Easily lasts for more than a day after exhaustive usage of Web meetings, hot spot, movie etc.
-----
SAMSUNG M31
-----
Good Phone in this budget. Camera quality is awesome. Plenty of options to click the pics in live focus,pro mode, night mode. Very handy and the blue color is good. On the battery side, currently getting backup more then 1 day. Let see in coming days. 6 GB RAM with 128GB memory. Usually disadvantage of Samsung mobile is that it gets hung after some days.. But need to see in this mobile with 6 GB ram.. As of now NO hanging ..Overall Good mobile to buy in this budget. If People of bored of mi,honor and other mobiles.. I suggest to go with this mobile..
-----
Great phone, NOT for gaming!
-----
I have been using this phone for a week now and so far it has been great. I would rate the features as following:
1) Battery life 9.5/10
2) Screen 8/10
3) Speakers 7/10
4) Gaming -/10 (I don't play games and I'll  suggest you to skip this phone if gaming is your primary concern)
5) Camera (both main and selfie) 6.5/10 - 10 being Pixel 4's camera

One point I would like to add here is that though scrolling on this phone and the overall UI experience is ok most of the time, it doesn't feel very fluid. One can't expect everything from a 15k phone, I suppose.

GO FOR IT..THIS DEVICE IS MARVELOUS.
-----
Overall phone is awsome.. after using this phone i found that fingerprint reader  is soo fast and 64 MP camera is really awsome and in night  camera is giving absolute results.. and 6000 mah battery giving you mind blowing experience it will give you 2 days battery backup its my personal  experience .. and charging  is also very fast. so go for it
-----
Over heating
-----
Don't buy waste of money.
1.Phone is very heating in normal use also.
2.Back finger print area surrounding body plastic is not proper fixed.
3.Very cheep type plastic body.
4. For this Exnos 9611 prossser 6000 Mah battery is not enough. 10000 Mah batter require dew to over heating.
5.Battery charging for full taken 3 Hrs.
Totally my opinion don't buy..wait for Redmi 9pro/Max.
-----
Good and bad reviews
-----
The mobile is good, the batterlife is superb when keep it ideal it stands for 40 hrz and when we use it keeping the internet on it stands for almost 12 hrs... the camera is just ok..when we take the snap and zoom the taken picture to the max zoom the clarity is not good its bit blur...I have compared with one plus 48 mega pixel the clarity is not that good..but generally it's fine...u can't the zoom the picture at 64 mega pixel and u can't zoom in selfie....remaining features are good...
-----
After one week use
-----
Honest review
-----------------
This mobile is not for today's generation.
Basic apps are not available you have to install 3rd party apps (compass, data uses viewer, data speed viewer, ram booster, even default music and video player) you cannot lock apps to run in background.
Camera quality is ok not great.
Battery is not upto mark discharge very soon, faceunlock is very poor, speaker is also very poor produce very low quality and less sound.
Only Samsung brand and its display is ok.
-----
Most amazing phone at a very good price point
-----
This an amazing phone at this price point. I have been using iPhone 7 and Samsung galaxy s7 edge. This phone is as advanced and as a matter of fact has even more features (maybe because of the newer android os)
The screen is big and has a very good resolution. The camera quality is good as such did not find much difference from other phones except for the clarity of pictures.
There is absolutely no lag in performance.
The best part being the battery life which is superb. I am a heavy user and the phone battery lasts for 2 days.
To sum up: more than value for money.
-----
Sound Problem in the Samsung Galaxy M31 mobile. Kindly replace defected mobile with new Mobile.
-----
There is sound defect ( problem  ) in the mobile.  Once we receive a call then the sound does not work, we are unable to hear any video. Then again we have to restart the mobile to hear the volume. Due to Lockdown we were unable to return the mobile on the given time.
So I here by request you to replace the defected mobile with  new mobile.
-----
I Got More From Expectationüòä
-----
If I tell Truth.....Really i got more from expectation in this budget segment.
Performance is Absolutely Stunning in daily usage as well as in gaming also.
The massive battery of phone 6000mAh is give you full and half day battery backup.
And what i say of Super amoled Display and 64mp Stunning Camera, 32 mp selfie gives you smile. And also Samsung One UI 2.0 gives you a best UI experience ever . Personally I recommend to you go without doubt. ü§ó
-----
Excellent!!!
-----
Very good performance
Liked it !!
Just go for it
It will not disappoint you
Can play PUBG and COD at high graphics
Nice camera
AR emoji works perfect
No issues at all
New update is available !!
Very smooth screen
S-AMOLED display is great
But,
Wanted the 128GB version which was unavailable due to some technical issues .
Called Amazon service care but they said that the issue will solve after 4-5 days .
So bought this one (64GB)
So far so great !!!
Just go for it
-----
SAMSUNG M31 have every thing in price range of 16k
-----
Samsung M31 i have received on Monday and i can proudly say that its a very good mobile within this price. I was very much confused as samsung was offer 6GB ram along 128GB in this price range with  6000mAH battery, but after using this mobile i am happy to own this mobile. Look &amp; feel, interface while using mobile, battery backup, speed, finger print sensor and available usable RAM approx 3.2 GB (after loading most of apps) will give you a WOW experience. In 16k budget i an finally say its a very good phone.
-----
Just Go for it. Great deal
-----
A flagship budget phone.
Can't expect more from brand like samsung for 15k
Awesome camera. Make sure you change the setting to 64 before click.
Battery backup is phenominal
Great display you can get at this price
Black varient is more classy
Fingerprint and faceunlock works flawlessly
For me 6000 mah came 3 days for normal usage
Android 10 and one UI 2.0 out of the box is a great plus. Software is more fluid and fast.
Multitasking is very good. Samsung did a brilliant work memory management.
Just go for it with closed eyes :)

Samsung has tuned this monster to perfection
-----
The mobile by itself is a master piece of technology and the highlights are the camera's and battery.  Value for money and promise kept well by Samsung.  This is our 4th Samsung mobile we've bought through Amazon and all are working hassle free. This master piece outwits redmi or Huawei by miles in performance and battery life. The draw back is that its has a heavy built and weighs a bit. But Indian people like the reliability than looks. To sum up,  this is a monster of a deal.
-----
What more could I have asked in a phone
-----
This is one of the most fantastic mobile devices of recent times. With excellent speed and a monster battery which goes on and on, it's is truly a fantabulous package from Samsung at an affordable price. A lovely camera which beautifully alters and optimises your old pics. A good finger print reader, a device to scan QR code, the list is endless. Thanks Samsung for making such a thoughtful device for first time Samsung users like me and turning them to become your brand ambassadors for this lovely device.
-----
Good phone at this price
-----
Everything seems to be good, the phone is fast, excellent weight distribution, doesn't feel heavy at all being apprx 200 gms weight, yhd display is superb, only issue is sometime fave recognition doesn't seem to work and phone is restarted without any reason.

I'm always a big fan of samsung. Becoz my 1st phone was also a samsung.
About galaxy m31:
1)Fingerprint scanner is awesome
2)Massive battery with amazing battery backup
3)Samsung super-amoled display is out of the universe so i fill amazing viewing experience
4)And no company can beat camera quality of samsung m31 at this price
5)I also like UI of samsung m31
6)Forgot all other brands because in mobile technology samsung is always on the top

Feel cheated
-----
Box seal.is damaged please replace my product immediately one seal is on another seal it is not possible.. that means some body change the accessories in the box or phone too...
Kindly replace as soon as possible
-----
Best featured phone for the price
-----
Absolutely fantastic for the price it is packed with things that normally you would get in very expensive phones totally impressed with the features for the price... I cannot believe that you can get so many features for under 15000 phone.. I am surely buying it for both my children
-----
Go for it!
-----
The display is top notch and the best in the price segment. It's not so heavy even though it comes with 6000mAh battery. Software feels lite and not bloated unlike other brands' phones in this price segment. The quad camera and the ocean blue give a rich look to the phone. I have used the phone outdoors for more than a day with considerable charge left.  Camera is also pretty good for taking normal and wide angle shots. Low light photos are not as good as expected but decent.
-----
Best phone

This is the best phone comparison of mi real me vivo oppo all Chinese mobiles,really best phone

Worst service
-----
It's not look like Samsung worst service and bad customer service
-----
Heating problem and touch screen problem
-----
It is very disappointing that phone has heating issue. On simple use you will feel the heat and once you have played any game then it is like old iron. It is heat the upper part of phone i.e. camera side.

On the other hand screen stuck while using whatapps. Screen touch start working abnormal. I have brought  2 handsets i feel similar  issues in both of the handsets.

I am not a tech bug but second phone user has raised concern  to amazon they have ask to install diagnostic  software  after that i have no idea what they have done to his handset.
-----
Good mobile in budget
-----
Good mobile with superb display and great speed. Camera is best in sunlight. But not good in dark. Specially if you use slow motion camera indoor it is not clear. Sound quality is superb. Audio and video quality is also best.
-----
Best in Battery and All others...
-----
Poor Camera...
64 MP and 4 Cameras are showing up a promotional value only. Its Camara having not best option for manual operating. If i have go to 64 mp option then sum functions are not supported.
Battery life is 20+hours on continues using any how...
Others all the features are better in my knowledge...
-----
Amazingly awesome product in budget
-----
Worth a every penny. It's a amazingly awesome phone in the budget. Feels great and smooth. Very slick design. Comfortable in hand. Below are pros and cons

Good product.. Writing product review after using 3days...
Long wait for the perfect mobile...
I have used both M30s and M31.
M31
*Performance wise best
*Long battery standby
*64mp photos good..
*Front cam excellent..
Overall Worthy to buy really Monster Mobile üòç
-----
Waste of money
-----
Samsung m31 mobile is Really worst product don't buy this mobile because camera clarity very poor phone weight is too high difficult to handle and as well as it is not a super amoled display totally waste of money
-----
Best Mid-range phone ..!!!!
-----
I am using this phone from almost one month.  Till now I didn't face any issue. Fingerprint sensor works well.
Camera quality is just Great. I went to manali with this phone and Pictures and vedios are of superior Quality. I love it's camera. Low light picture quality is also fine.
Huge battery (6000mAh) is given with this phone. I am a heavy user and for me it works more than a day. The only issue I feel is, battery takes little long time to fully charge, but it's worth once it's charged. I am very satisfied with this phone. Just go with it. :-)

SIMPLY - CUSTOMER DELIGHT PRODUCT
-----
I like this Product a lot because as a Customer we will definitely expect a X-Factor in all the products which we buy. But this Galaxy M31 is like a Customer Delight Product which will surprise with you its features (More Features which are basically available in Premium Segment Mobiles) and look at an affordable price . Definitely it is a Product which is Worth more than its Price.
Recommended to many of my Friends and Family and none of them came with any IFS and Buts till now.
"SIMPLY - CUSTOMER DELIGHT" product which will never disappoint You
-----
M31  satisfies you who wants under ‚Çπ15,000/- than others..
-----
Finger print reader is so good as it very simple to set. That, which we can set  2 or more times, i like it

Camera quality is also very impressive feature in m 31.Im fully satisfied. As we compare to other 64 mp available mobile brands.

"Worst battery ".  The battery life of 6000 mah could not reach my expectations little bit.it acts as 3000 mah battery In m31 mobile, When I charged 100%,  it is decreasing within 10 hours. Without using to watch videos or playing games. Means, should have to charge again. Finally am not satisfied with the this battery.
-----
Wonderfulü§óü§ó
-----
Such a beautiful mobile and camera quality is ultimate...the picture is like a pro photographer...I have recieved my galaxy M31 in 1 day delivery.  And the gaming performance ultime..in this price. I play the pubg mobile in smoothly..but some times frame drop happend ..u should improve that in next update.
  And the look of the mobile is very good..and battery performance also nice (6000 mah battery) we can play the game for 8 hrs in 100 % charge...and normal usage is 2days ...
(Overall tha mobile is perfect) seriously it's a mega monster üî•üî•üî•
-----
Very good phone but could have been better
-----
Termed as a mega  monster this lives up to its billing when it comes to battery life and i have been using this phone for over a week and I am very satisfied with the battery life,the screen is just gorgeous  to look at  the best in its class I can say camera is also good please buy a cover and screen guard that's a must with this phone and charging  timing could have been reduced if the charger has better capacity , also would have been nice if there was a cover given too,finger print reader is fast but be careful if you have sweaty hands might not work
-----
VALUE FOR MONEY . Samsung Again... Thank u Samsung
-----
Its an amazing device in this price range. Esp Display and Camera.its too good. BATTERY life is Perfect. Compared wth A50 s..little bit bulky ... android 10 buttery smooth...processor.ram.memory..even the sise is same as of M30 S. (Chk gsmarena comparison). But the 64 mp camera did the Magic..Thank U Samsung and Amazon.

One of the Best Mobile(Price &amp; Specs Wise) Value for Money
-----
Really a good phone compared with the other`s Brands available in the same price range and Specs. Display, camera, Finger print scanner, fast charging some of the built in features are really good. Over all good.

Doesn't comes with Head phones or any other  accessories. On Samsung site its available for less(Don`t know how their delivery service will be).

Battery last`s for almost 30 hrs, on normal usage, i was in the assumption that 6000mah may last for at-least 40+hrs
-----
#MegaMonster is really killing it
-----
Amazing phone by Samsung in this range.
Awesome touch.
Battery life is almost 1.5 days(normal usage like calls,messages ,mails )
Fingerprint -5*
Face unlock -4*
Camera - in love with wide angle shots.

Cons
I dont know whether this is facebook app problem or phone's but sometimes i feel like in notifications the first content is half hidden and you cant drag it.

Otherwise till date(6th day from date of purchase) havent faced any issue and in love with this #Mega Monster
-----
Network signals, Camera, battery and look
-----
Network: even if you won't get enough signals then also no need to worry about Mobile data and calling.

Camera: it's nicely with a high resolution. Selfie camera give nearly same pic as realistic

Battery: It's long blasting works for full day with 100%. Play music, games and whatever you want. But it takes 1.5 hrs to charge it full.

Look: it's good, look wise with smoothies edges. Gives you a feel of curve edge
-----
upper part is very hot.
-----
I felt myself very bad for switching  back to Samsung. It is having all good quality as they mention in specifications. But I can't imagine  why it is generating that much of heat at upper half part of mobile. Very scary even to touch. Hope it will be solved in future with some system upgradation. Waiting for the same

Overall M31 6GB/128GB is a complete package worth for Rs.15999
-----
Overall M31 6GB/128GB is a complete package worth for Rs.15999. It has best Camera &amp; battery in this amount.
But processor Samsung M31 has exynos 9611, should have snapdragon 7932. It is compatible but not that much fast as snapD...
I order for Ocean Blue.. Amazon sent me Black coloured... that is really bad on Amazon part.. I still kept this piece as I was OK with the colour.
Sound quality is good. With headphones the feature of DolbyAtoms is awesome..
It is a better mobile to use, in this amount..
-----
Value for Money and the Samsung Brand.
-----
Been using this phone for a week now, definitely a value for money. The camera is REALLY good and what makes this model stand apart is the BIG BATTERY. I've been using my phone continuously for 2 days now and I still have around 20% charge left.
Not an avid gamer, but it does a good job there as well.
The only drawback I felt was, no earphones/back cover provided in the box.
Overall, definitely a value for money phone with the latest Android version.
-----
Overall it's a worthful product
-----
I recently bought this phone .its really worthy to buy for this prize.
First thing is long battery which really coming for almost 30 hrs with continous usage
Verygood ram speed
Clarity in screen
Easy handling
Good camera adding more shiny and smooth picture in luding the gront camera
Face and finger printing reading is really fast
Since memory is good no hanging
Night mode is good pleasant to the eyes.with
Smart view easily connected with any device
I think its really worth to buy this product compared to redmi oppo viva or any other one
-----
After 60 days!!!
-----
After 60 days:
Great deal in this price range, especially for those who love watching videos and who enjoy music a lot and also who travel a lot.

Camera is good.

Battery: Without a shadow of a doubt, it's a monster. I was concerned about its charging speed; but after using this almost for a week, it doesn't bother me. It takes around 2hr30min.

I'm not a big fan of games. I've been playing "hill climb racing 2" which shows stutter problem almost each time. Not happy about that :(
Needs better optimization.
-----
Descent budget phone
-----
Review as per me :

Pros:
Camera is descent enough to capture good photos in daylight.
Battery monster for sure
Amoled display

Cons:
Night photos are not so good if you need details and needs lot of improvement.Good for social medias only
Fast Charger is not exactly a fast Charger for 6000mah battery and takes time
Processor is of M30s which does the tasks but not heavy ones and was really disappointing one from Samsung.

Overall I would say it's a 7/10.
Choose according to your needs.
-----
Sound quality
-----
it is not upto mark even....  not yet all fast charging..... very very low sound... please don't buy
-----
Feedback of Samsung Galaxy M31
-----
The phone is amazing.....the battery life of this phone is so long lasting....by using  it continuously from last 3-4 days...the results are awesome...the 64mp camera is also too good...the screen response is excellent. And the games runs smoothly on this device. I am giving a 5star rating due to complete package of phone... at this price I am really impressed by this device. I will advise everyone  to buy this budget phone. I liked the phone by the price of phone it's just 14999 and getting a impressive all package phone at Thank you.
Lavish.
-----
Not Happy. Totally disappointed.
-----
Not better than its predecessor, M30s. Slow in face unlock. Hanging from the first day itself. 64 MP camera isn't upto the mark. It's  quality and clarity is equal to the 48 MP camera of M30s. Not happy. Finger print sensor is not responding sometimes. 6000 mAh Battery is only for numbers. Isn't lasting even for one day with moderate usage. Totally disappointed.
-----
Good one, worth it.
-----
I bought this mobile for my father recently. First thing I like about this phone is the camera, it's pretty good.  Love the camera clarity and capability to capture minute details. Coming to the screen, I like the smoothness and big full screen. Screen clarity is on par with the high resolution prominent mobiles. It never gets stuck and really smooth. I'm happy that I picked this phone as a gift for dad. It's his first smartphone and slowly learning using the smart phone, this phone is really smooth and its makes him excited to explore this phone.

Dont waste your money
-----
I am normal user ..no games ,no much chatting, no watching movies  but battery drains within  oneday .Its not coming up to 2 days as they have mentioned 6000mah ..
Facing hearting issue when we use of internet which is worst for this series phone I guess.
Dont see for branded name as I was also cheated like that.
Still it's my 4th day..
Thinking to change this phone ..

Seller is good and amazon service also is damn good as they have delivered on sameday .
-----
Not that much satisfied.Good on but batery and speed disappented
-----
Face reader not working properly
Camer ok
Sume camera app perfoming slow in 6gm 64 /-
Also disply fixing not properly and not perfet fitting qulity not good.befor compayer to samsung old models
Sound qulity good. Amlog display good
Hitting prblem low using oline movie
Batery useing wifi 1.30hr 10% then 12 hr will finesh batery. Charging also slow 3.30 hr for full charging
-----
Probably the best phone I have used till now
-----
Initially I was about skeptical on buying a sub 20k phone. . But from the time I started to read about the model and specifications , something was pulling me towards this phone and when I received my order . I knew that it was my best decision that day. . The vibrant screen to the diverse camera options to the best battery life on any smartphone made this piece an awesome choice. Altogether getting it from a brand like Samsung was the best of all. . Enjoying the phone day to day . . . Quiet a Monster M31 is !!!!
-----
Don't buy this phone
-----
Lot of problems with this phone it restarts automatically and it will be hold for 15 minutes with Samsung log on this screen, network goes down suddenly, signals shows full but unable to make the calls or receive the calls

Went to customcare they have updated the software with latest version as per them this will fix all my issues but now same issues plus phone getting heat if I use it for 15 minutes

My suggestion is not to buy this phone
-----
Best amount for money  in this range please buy for m31 without any doubts
-----
Try Samsung Galaxy m31. It's the good Choice.
-----
6GB+128gb. It's  quiet awesome. Performance is very good. The above uploaded photos are taken in SAMSUNG Galaxy m31. In low light mode m31 is good comparing redmi note 8 pro. Battery backup is more than 24hrs including usage of Online streaming, PUBG game, calls, Facebook and whatsapp. Average battery drains per hour is 2.166% without gameplay. In this segment, this is a very good smartphone. In higher graphics of PUBG , frame is dropping off little but gameplay was very good. I don't like to be finger captured in backside because of Plastic.
-----
Very good phone for all except camera lovers
-----
Everything is good in this phone... specially display is excellent and also battery backup is too good... yesterday evening at 6:00 my battery was at 100% now this time 9.30 a.m in the morning battery is still 94% with moderate use..no gaming....
Cons- camera is not so good, warm and cloudy pics and selfies.
No screengaurd
No mobile cover
Overall phone is good for those who prefer display, battery and performance over camera....phone is not for camera lover üôèüôè
-----
Nice product
-----
After using 5 days here are review:
Pros-
1. Nice camera, specifically night mode and super slow mode is superb.
2. Good display
3. Awesome internet speed for 4Vodafone. In previous phone(on nxt) speed was 3-4 mbps, but in this phone speed is about 20mbps.
4. Huge battery that can last 2 days.
5. 128 GB internal memory and 6 GB ram.

Cons:.
1. Screen size is 6.4 but actually image and video runs  on 5.5 inch only and that is the big issue.
2. Charging is slow.
-----
Great phone for moderate usage!
-----
Pros:
1. Excellent display quality.
2. Decent battery life.
3. User friendly UI with lag free experience.
4. Phone is not too heavy considering the battery capacity.

Cons:
1. Photos from Selfie come out to be soft in indoor lighting condition, Even after disabling the beauty mode the camera tries to smoothen the skin tone, I hope a software update for front facing camera can fix it.
2. Photos from macro camera seems average.
3. Overall I would say this phone's camera needs software optimization.
-----
I think I received duplicate product
-----
Received the product on 11th of march 2020. Within 15 days of delivery various functions of the product stopped working..
Like the mic as well as the speaker of the phone got obsolete. And many more problems arises..Due to Lockdown i was unable to contact with Customers Care.
i think that they delivered the Duplicate Product.. Highly recommend not to buy any of the electronic products from Amazon..so that you will Also not have to face the problem as mine..as right i am in a condition that i have wasted Rs 17,000 in the phone...

-----
Getting  heated complained customer support  to return but no returns  accepted. Camera is not much clear as they advertise. Not good.
New issue is phone call not able to disconnect  once connected,
Very very bad and disappointed
Never ever buy Samsung mobiles.
-----
Must go for it best phone ever.
-----
Very good phone in this range. All must go for it rather than redmi, vivo or other phone in same budget. Camera is very nice and hang issues are completely resolved by Samsung. I have been using Samsung from 2015 and it has improved a lot in low budget phones also.  Battery is powerful and durable than all other android phone.

Samsung m31 review
-----
Phone performance are excellent in term of performance
Touch works superbly
Overall phone is excellent
Some things that can be improved-
Front cameras, I would say 6/10 not uptown the standard of 32 MP
Rear camera I would say 7/10, not up to the exact standard of 64 MP
Camera compare to vivo oppo and other phones of  same range phone is on lower side
But performance as compare to vivo, oppo and other phone of same range is on upper side
Back touch sensor work good
Face unlock also work good
-----
Value for Money with Samsung Galaxy M31. Sabaka Bap.
-----
Amazing Phone with great configurations and user friendly features &amp; interface. After 3 days of roughly uses I realized that  Samsung is Samsung. I installed 160 Apps, Storage of 128 gb consumes  110 gb with fully consumed 32 gb SD card, still no lagging.
Really loved this Samsung Galaxy M31.
Camera 5/5.
Battery 5/5.
Design 5/5.
Processor and user interface 5/5.
Display Touch outstanding 5/5.
Really for One + users this is better option.
Boss Samsung is Super Champ.

A Nice Mobile --SAMSUNG M31: YOU Must GO FOR IT
-----
Working very nice... looks very good. It's sensor is so good that it feels like butter touch. The price is worth purchasing.. Samsung is giving you a lot in this price like Android 10, Gorilla glass, 6000 mAh Li-ion battery, crystal clear dolby sound , battery back up is very good, Ocean Blue looks attractive, but its C -type charging cable should have been a little longer in size. So, I  recommend yo buy it because Samsung is giving much more than the other products available at the se price in market.
-----

Satisfied with this buy
-----
Being an moderate user here are my views on M31 after using it for 7 days
Pro:
1. Great battery life
2. Decent camera quality
3.  No words to explain the display

Cons:
1. Low light camera not good
2. Heats up!! Yes you heard it right ,mobile heats up quickly while gaming

Overall its a good midrange phone, best for day to day use in this segment, if you are gamer then i think you are in wrong place(unless samsung rectifies it by update).

Most importantly delivery is super fast.
-----
Overall, it's a good phone.
-----
I like the smoothness on the phone, it's camera is really good, the zoom allows the picture not to get pixelated even if you zoom in a lot. The fingerprint gesture and the face recognition is quite fast in comparison to other phones. Battery life is good. However,  the phone gets heated up at times and becomes difficult to take a call and placing on the ear when it's heated up. Also, the phone automatically restarts in between, maybe once every 3-4 days. Overall, this is a good phone for this price!
-----
Budget phone. Don't expect too much in camera
-----
Budget phone. Don't expect too much in camera.
Pros:
1. Budget wise good configuration.
2. Screen refresh rate is good.
3. The feature are too good like dual window, multiple screen.
Cons:
1. Camera is not great. 64 MP photo shots - after binding it has too much noise.
2. Macro camera shot - focus of the object is not proper ,hope there ll be software update.
3. Battery back up - one full charge lasts for only 12hr with normal usage.

M31 at a glance - Be a part of samsung family . Damn surely you'll love it .
-----
Every thing is quite good .
Charger with only 15 w and Battery is the only concern
As it comes with 6000mah but not behaving like that ..
Its sensors is good .
providing a best graphic experience
Its amoled screen is the best feature of its .
Gaming experience too is good
Somewhere its getting a heating issue .
But in this amount range... allover its one of the best recommendable phone .
One should buy and be a part of samsung family .. u will love it .
-----
Poor performance specially battery and camera
-----
It's very bad experience  I did it  drain battery without usage and took 3 hours to full charge and camera features  are not exactly  given very bad experience
-----
Tough competent to flagship phones
-----
I was thinking to buy Samsung S20 Ultra. One of my friend told me about M31 launch and i checked about the features on internet. I fell in love with M31 and decided to go for it instead of S20 and i am proud to say that my decision was correct. This is a Mega monster for sure. 64 MB camera, 6 Gb RAM, 128 Gb memory and 6000 mAH battery. Everything is same as what you expect from a flagship phone. Camera is awesome, features are superb and no comparison to the battery, it lasts for 2 days for me. Thankyou Samsung for M31 launch.
-----
Awesome phone...worth the money spent
-----
The phone has excellent build quality, supurb display and huge battery life. My battery lasts for 2 days of normal to moderate use when fully charged. Phone lacks in fast charging, it is not that fast but it get compensated by big battery life. Rear camera is also good. Front camera is decent. Colour reproduction is very good, thanks to super amoled display. Watching movies and surfing on social media is delight on this device.
Overall the phone is worth the money in mid range price section.
-----
Issue of hang
-----
Not worth it, dont buy it. I purchase it few days back only hardly 15 days happens by looking at its battery size &amp; specification. Battery life is really good, no doubt on it but i am facing the issue which i never thought. Its hangs, with even 6 gb ram still the device hang automatically &amp; that too for 5-10 min &amp; i am unable to do in that situation as battery is non removable in nowdays devices. I really wants to replace it but already 10 days pass so company will not take it back also. Think once while buying this product.
-----
It's a Monster!
-----
It's the best mid ranger phone. It's has everything what a person needs. Big battery which is its wow feature, it helps me to not to charge  a phone for 2 days. Camera has it's top notch quality. The front notch has pleasant design and it is waterproof, as I have tested. Fingerprint reader is very  much fast as compared to other phones. It's  sleek and lightweight  as it's  have 6000 MAH battery but it doesn't feel bulky. I prefer you to buy this without comparing because it's the best monster.
-----
Best in Class with power packed features &amp; performance
-----
I have always been a loyal customer with Samsung since 2004. I had just started thinking of switching "BRANDS" this time. On my lookout, i came across Samsung Galaxy M31 and did a detailed comparison with other competitive brands &amp; found  Samsung Galaxy M31 to be far more superior than the rest. This was justified with my purchase.  So far no complaints.....
Pro's:  One day delivery, Best Battery life, Rear Camera is excellent, Front Camera is good,  Finger print &amp; Face Unlock has quick response.
Con's: NIL so far
-----
Check the proper working of the microphone
-----
I bought this product last week through Amazon. The camera is of high clarity and overall it is a really good phone. But there is something wrong with the mobile's microphone. During a call I end up sounding muffled or far off to the person on the other end even if I am using an earphone. It is really turning out to be a major issue due to the high strain with which I have to speak. I am thinking about returning back the product. Plus the battery too is running out a bit fast. Other than that the product is great and handy.
-----
Done right thing
-----
Ordered my new Galaxy M31 last week. The first impression was good.  Build quality  looks premium, though metallic body would have been great. Quite fast to operate. Excellent  bright display. Camera clicks good quality photos. Macro cam is gives moderate  quality  clicks. Battery lasts longer and recharge doesnt take unusually  long time.
Overall happy with my choice. At this price point,  it is one of the best device  available in market.
-----
Best phone for Heavy media user
-----
M31 comes with super amoled display so waching movies are very plesent. Gaming is good but dont aspect very high fps. Camera wise good and battery what we say 10+ SOT so what more we want. Overall a great package.

Best premium phone had never before, definitely go for it
-----
Best phone in this price,
I read all negative reviews,
But when I use m31 from 1week ,iI found conclusion that,this phone is far ahead of Chinese brand,it looks premium, camera is best,
Some functions only me has isDARK MODE,SUPER SLOW MOTION PICTURE &amp;AUDIO,THE S AMLOID EXPERIENCE IS ROCKING.
And lastly those who have negative reviews or some problems for m31 ,is only matter of users understanding because this phone have much advance features in camera and os &amp;it takes atleast 1week to full understand &amp; remember all this
-----
Best budget phone under 15K!!!
-----
Things which make this device a good pick:
1)Amoled display makes the user experience really smooth.
2)camera quality in outdoors is amazing.
3)body design is nicely crafted,people asked me which phone is this often.
4)the user interface is nicely designed so there is no confusion and mismanagement.
Few cons:
1)Camera can dissapoint sometimes in low light.
2)battery drains faster but 6000mah manages it well.
3)charging upto 70% is fast then it takes time
-----
Best in this price segment
-----
User interface is awesome, nice display, battery lasts for more than 24 hours with normal use with wifi and data on. I ordered it on 5th march and the phone was delivered on 8th march. Till now it's running very smoothly, camera quality is best in this prise segment.

After using more than 3 months i recommend this phone to others also and ordered one more unit. In this price segment this is the best phone. But this time price hike is the disappointing thing...
-----
A Good phone
-----
Value for money . Couldn't have found a better phone in this budget . Works quickly at your command , its super fast . The camera quality is superb it definitely makes you look better . Very easy to operate . Didnt have difficulty switching to the new phone by using samsung switch . The touch is also very smooth . I charge it in 2 days time despite making lots of calls and listening music via bluetooth and using social media as well . The battery life is phenomenal .
-----
Touch screen isnt responding
-----
Worst product and worst company. I bought this mobile on March 11th 2020. after a month suddenly it displayed "Accidental touch protection" alert and since then touch stopped responding. Now i'm not even able to open mobile. it is just a dummy piece now. when contacted samsung support, they didnt even help on this. During these tough times how does this company expects us to communicate without mobile.

Please stop manufacturing these kind of cheap mobiles.
-----
Good phone for the category. ..
-----
I have been using this phone for last 15 day .

1) Delivery was little ,not uptown the mark as the person was not trained.

2) Finger print reader is good didn't feel any lag
3) Camera is good for this category  .
4)  I get 2 day of average  usage . Battery life .
-----
Best killer phone in mid range till now
-----
Finger print sensor is awesome, the quick way it unlock the phone is very satisfying.
Camara quality is way beyond expected the color of image &amp; contrast rate is nice. Options provided in pro mode is very nice &amp; useful, selfi Camara also playing very nice role. It is also quick in unlocking phone by face recognition.
Battery life is fo far good, I was expected battery will  comes around 2 days but getting around 1.5 can't say it is bad. Optimizing the apps may give more efficiency.
-----
Awesome mobile and worth for every penny..
-----
This is amazing deal with Amazon to purchase Samsung Galaxy M31 mobile.
1. It has super strong battery backups.
2. Awesome display.
3. Nice speaker and voice clarity.
4. It has plastic back body but looks fine just like to premium.
5. Camera awesome both.

but seriously i feel that charging speed is fast and too good.
go for it if you want all rounder phone.
-----
Issues with this model of phone.
-----
This is the worst Samsung phone I ever had. I have been always a Samsung user. But this time this model of phone is very worst.
- The phone hangs each and every time,specially while typing...
- 1st it hangs and then it automatically get restart. Or sometimes it get restart without doing anything.

Display/Screen is illustrious.

Too much of storage.

-----
It's 64 MP is equal with 12MP camera of other brand
-----
Bought it on first sale day , was really  excited , but recieved delivery after 8 days , disappointed with the camera. 64 MP camera pictures quality  is same with pictures of 12 MP camera  from other brand. Processor , screen, is average. But battery is ok.
-----
Reallly a mega monster
-----
Best phone ever from Samsung in this price range, Samsung has shown that their cameras are the best at any price range, a very great job with the battery, a reasonable processor for a phone priced at this range and with their awesome sAMOLED screen it's reallly a monster #megamonster
The best part is 64mp beast camera for high quality pictures and 4k videos and also a decent night mode with a 6000mah mega battery what else do you need in a phone
#smoothaf with their AMOLED screen with the latest  android 10
-----
A average phone user
-----
I shifted from a Moto G6 ...fingerprint sensor at back  wasn't a good transition for me ...though the sensor is quite good.

Camera ...wilh all those 4 cameras...pics still come bit soft . Ex. Skin texture gets smoothened .

Battery ....I don't play games ..and neither do I watch movies . Just regular social media apps and WhatsApp . Even my calls are very less. Still the bulky battery just lasts bit more than a day. And it takes bit long to fast charge ...which feels as if it's not fast charging.
-----
Was excited to get my first samsung phone but little disappointment.
-----
When i got the phone the battery was 0% and i had to charged it before first use. I don't know it is normal or not.also it has some heating issues and camera quality is not upto the mark.what i most like about the phone is display quality and i don't think any other phone at this price range would have such a display.
-----
Indian wallet's best buddy
-----
I bought it on the first day of the sale itself. Have been using it for one week.  Camera quality's excellent , a notch above competition. Same goes about tge display as well. SAmoled screen's very vivid and crystal clear, especially with fhd videos. Battery can easily push 30-36 hrs even if u use it extensively. Not a gamer. So cant review about processer.
However the only one issue i noticed is the mobile data/ wifi may become unresponsive/ idle. We will have to turn off wifi/ toggle flight mode to solve it.

Battery life , display , design and camera quality
-----
I ordered Samsung galaxy m31 on 5th March delivered in 6th march I will check battery life almost 1.5 days it will be run of heavy usage to seeing videos on YouTube,WhatsApp &amp; other apps are run and internet  connection always on . Display colour , quality and touch response is good . Sound is not loud but in headphones Dolby atmos support is great experience. Camera creates such nice images.one complain about Samsung why they not give back cover , screenguard, and headphones.charger is slow because battery is big.

Amazing phone with Amzing camera ‚ù§
-----
Using it from last 10 days, found no issue yet.
Best thing is the main USB of the phone, its 64 MP quad camera, shoots amazing photos and video. Also the front camera is very good.
Have smooth performance while playing games like PUBG. Also have 6000 mAh battery  so you can play games, movies etc. for a long time. So overall it's a very good phone in this price range than other brands. Also no unnecessary ads issues with other brands, have very clean and nice UI without any unnecessary preinstalled apps.
-----
Not a good choice as per price and so many issues
-----
My review after 1 week of use :

Heating issues - while charging,  on video calls, during video recording,  while doing still photography in HDR mode.

Back sensors - not working properly, you have to try multiple times.

Camera - 3.5/5 camera is okay but not as per claim of 64mgpxl.

Wifi issue- it's not able to connect to some wifi networks however at the same time other phones are able to connect to the same wifi.

Battery- with full charging it is lasting for 1 day with normal use.
-----
Basic phone. Nothing matches with specifications. Better to go for Chinese phones.
-----
Just a basic phone.  If you have a fix budget below 15k, u may go for it.  Samsung has tried to make fool the customers with the pre launch specifications about this model. I never prefer Chinese phones, but after seeing this Samsung phone, I can surely say Oppo Vivo RealMe and RedMe are much more better than this. Cameras are like dummy tiny glasses. All other specifications are only in written. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
-----
Super Phone
-----
Worth every penny spend on the mobile.  Excellent Cameras, Good Battery Back Up, Super smooth operation and processing speed, good voice clarity, internet and calls get connected well on feeble network range also.
-----
frustrated to buy it
-----
Finger unlock Works very slow need to touch 2 to 3 time to unlock.
Camera quality is also ok ok not good as company describing. Battery is like dran  very fast have to charge within a 12 to 14 hour.
-----
Best phone in this price range.
-----
Have been using this mobile over 14 days. Its one of the best phones i have used so far. Battery, camera, superamoled display are main features the phone is offering, for me its sar value and its weight management add to it. It has its own limitation in night camera and heavy gaming, i dont mind them as its offering way more than many others in this price range.
Fully satisfied with this product and also has to appreciate fast delivery from amazon team.
-----
Error message seen when turned on
-----
When I first turned on the phone saw a screen with some kind of error details which I couldn‚Äôt understand. Not sure if this phone delivered to me is having any faults. After few tries it got powered on. So waiting for few more days to find out if there are any problems. It may be one of case.
-----
Worthfull superb..phone
-----
Camera quality somehow not match with my expectations.. but all the features I loved it..
-----
Awesome Camera with Awesome battery
-----
Awesome Camera that help me to Record 4k videos for my YouTube Channel " JOLLY Coaching "

Awesome Battery which let me enjoy everything for whole day from a single charge. It has long lasting battery life.

Super Amoled Display really impressing, which looks like a premium mobile display.

Really I love the Samsung,  Samsung mobiles and everything from Samsung,  because it not just a brand it is a most trusted brand of india.

Amazing device

Super mega monster &amp; King of all brands
-----
Best value for money in this mid range segment..
1. Plus point is Super Amoled display with the vibrant and eye-catching colors...For display can't beat any other brands.
2. 64mp quad camera's quality is truly awesome.. it captures very nice photos.
3. Mega monster 6000 Battery is one more plus point, although weight distribution is great...It will give you near about 2 days long battery backup.
4. Fingerprint sensor is also fast.
Overall it is super mega monster &amp; king of all brands
-----
I have received the faulty piece..no sound in phone
-----
The phone delivered to me is a faulty piece. It has no sound. number of users has reported the same issue in Samsung community. Because of lockdown i was not able to return it to Amazon and now Smasung service centers are also closed.
I want to request Amazon to increase the retun Window because of lockdown.

Samsung guys are also not supporting.I have wasted my money.  Please please don't buy this phone.
-----
Mega monster the beast
-----
Overall after using I was said super fanatic amazing in this budget phone and always Samsung top quality and display and performance and own Exynos processer 9611 and camera quality 64 mp 8mp and 5 mp 5 mp 32 mp selfie with 1.8 apracher
super steady mode and battery back up 6000 mAh I got 2 days of battery back and pubg lag free overall mega monster is suitable for M31 üòéüòéüòé side side side plz we are the Samsung .....
-----
Overall it's a good phone...
-----
Overall a good phone...

Though the processor could have been better, but considering rest of the features offered I would say it's fine...

It's definitely not a gaming centric phone, you can play games, but it might stutter at max settings like in PUBG.

You get good cameras (macro is mostly useless to me),
a great battery (lasts me a whole day on medium-heavy use) and
a good display...
I would say it is mostly focused towards those who watch a lot of videos...

Fabulous product!
-----
This phone is excellent.
Pros:
1. Does not feel heavy for the battery size.
2. Super display. Media consumption is a great experience on it.
3. Good camera: pics come out really good.
4. Battery lasts 2 day

Cons:
Back panel could have been textured to provide some grip but that can be tided over by adding a case as most smartphone users do regardless of the make and model.
-----
A great allrounder that's brilliant in almost all situations
-----
Amazing phone in budget line. Getting 2.5days on hard use. Night shot getting marvelous output of 1.8 aperture lens. 64MP quad Cam on test getting output quality more than expected. Macro less happy but ultrawide superb. No need of powerbank as massive 6000 mah will forgot charging daily. 1080p 60fps videos in amoled display in good refresh rate. Overall i will give 5 star compare to A Series.
Con: Macro 2.2 shots
Finger print scanner on display
-----
Best smartphone
-----
One of the best phones I ever had.
Battery life :-is just awesome I am a heavy user and till now  there are no issues regarding battery life neither heating issues.
Camera: - Rear camera is too good and gives awesome details in pictures.
Display:- Display is so satisfying and so responsive. And having so many customization to do.
Overall I can say is at this price range is awesome. You must go for this device. Also from Samsung a brand you can fully relay on.
-----
Best budget phone from a well known brand
-----
At first look and use:
- Phone looks sleek, ocean blue colour looks amazing
- big screen and very nice clarity as well as brighteness
- Huge battery for longer usage but at 15W charging, it takes time to charge to full
- smooth user interface
- Great camera for a budget phone, almost similar to expensive phones camera
-And ofcourse at 16k you get 128Gb of storage which is amazing!!!!

-Thank u amazon for a great deal at 16K and a 24 hour delivery
-----
Great phone for the price
-----
Hardware wise nothing to complain about everything is great but can use some software touches like camera i think the software need an upgrade the pictures taken get soften too much and the details get compromised, the fingerprint reader is fast the Samoled looks great!. Stock android would have been great had to uninstall a lot of unnecessary applications other UI is great and oh the battery life this baby could last ages long battery life one full charge and this will last all day even with heavy usages

Best Budget phone with overall good features
-----
The phone is anytime worth the price. The best part about this phone is its fast charging feature and battery backup, which is the most imp key factor in today‚Äôs world.
Camera is really good and the macro feature and super slow motion works very well.
The phone is overall the best phone in range of 15-20k.
-----
Not the best in the range
-----
The worst charging ever this phone has. I sometime feel I can press my clothes with the heat from this . Damn it's so slippery you will feel it's possed sometimes . The battery life is max for a Day . I don't know what is the strategy to bringout such low cost defctive phones with new one releasing every fortnight .
-----
The best ever mega monster!!!!!
-----
Reviewing after a month
The phone is absolutely a mega monster
Pros
It comes with a mega 6000Mah battery and stays till a couple a days with a normal usage
Fingerprint scanner works 9 out of 10 times
Camera quality is absolutely amazing the best 64 MP
It comes with Samsung's one UI
A SAMOLED 6.4 inch display

Cons
Face recognition works a little slow and 7 out of 10 times
Sound quality of speakers is awesome but it could have been more clear and loud
-----
Great phone with an amazing battery life!
-----
I ordered the phone right on the day it got launched, and have been heavily using it. Most of my office work including emails, calls, webinars is getting done through this amazing smartphone during this home stay phase, &amp; the best part is that I just need to charge it once in 2 days! Both the front and rear cameras take phenomenal photos in presence of adequate light. Not very suitable for low light photography.
In short, this budget phone is an excellent value for money.
-----
M31! A good budget phone
-----
The phone's pretty good ...battery backup is epic
And the display is really good compared to the other phones in the same price range
And I exchanged my vivo v9 which I bought it for 25k
But I got this phone for 15999 which very cheap and has a lot of cool features which my old phone didn't have
And battery lasts for nearly two days which is actually really good
I love the performance
And the fingerprint is also quite good
-----
A good value for money product with Samsung Brand Trust.
-----
By looking at the phone you doesn't feel that great, i mean the looks are quiet decent and ok but when it comes to features and performance it's totally bang on. Super Amoled Display, Quad Camera setup with 64mp primary camera at 15k price range will not disappoint you literally it's camera is awesome and yes 6000mah battery despite having such a monster battery the phone feels very light and handy due the the plastic material used at the back which makes it less attractive than other glass back panel.
-----
Awesome phone under 15K Budget
-----
1. Reasonable Price
2. Good Hardware
3. Software performance too good
4. Camera Algorithm working well
5. Battery Backup is amazing
6. UI Designed in well manner
7. Finger print implementation was too good
-----
Superb mobile amongst all.......
-----
You can blindly go for this phone........what a beautiful super amoled screen........what a nice touch.......superb camera both front and back.......excellent battery of 6000 mah.........smooth Samsung software.........nice gaming experience...................I specially recommend samsung mobile over all other mobiles as it is best among all other in this price range.......... I thanks to samsung and Amazon for providing me such a nice phone............
-----
Good phone
-----
I was earlier using samsung S9+, itwar almost 2 years and there started some problems,  while looking for replacement devices,  I found this model apt to suit my requirements,
priced correct,  the features are impeccable,
the handling is easy  . very good camera.
-----
A complete package. An awesome phone.
-----
This is a complete package from Samsung. Excellent Camera, Great Battery life, and tons of various features.

Finger print sensor is very sensative. Different camera modes allows you to take excellent quality photos with different modes. However, I am most impressed by it's battery life. It was good to see type C port with the phone.

This is overall a complete package and I have recommended this phone to all my friends. They all are having a very good experience using it as well.

Samsung's another bad performance phone
-----
I am using Samsung from last 10 years but I have facing multiple issues with M31 phone from the first day of purchasing. I will never recommend Samsung phone to anyone.

1. The phone sometimes restarts itself and sometimes gets stuck on Samsung itself for about 1 hour.
2. To much phone heating issue in normal uses.
3. To much phone hanging issue even some time phone is stuck for 1 to 2 hours.
4. I have raised the issue with Samsung but not get any solution from Samsung Team.
-----
Pathetic. No use..
-----
Yesterday I got the software updation notification. I also allowed to update the same, to morning it was updated. When I allowed to install, it has been hanged and showing error that "downloading do not turn off target". I am using as a official mobile but now at this lockdown situation I can't access any of my data, payment details, contacts etc. Then what is the user of buying this mobile I don't know. Very very pathetic situation due to the mobile problem.
-----
BAD EXPERIENCE WITH SAMSUMG M31
-----
I BOUGHT SAMSUNG M31 ON FIRST DAY BUT AFTER 10 DAYS ITS SPEAKER IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY WHEN I CALL SOMEONE WITH SPEAKER MY VOLUME IS NOT LISTEN BY ANOTHER END SO DO SOMETHING OR REPLACE MY MOBILE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
I AM NOT SATISFY WITH MY MOBILE SAMSUNG M 31

Samsung galaxy M31
-----
I have been using this phone now for two weeks. Iam delighted to acknowledge that for what amount I spent I bought a pretty nice phone. Battery life is great, finger print scanner works  fast, touchscreen is also very smooth.
I can click colorful photos with a wide angle feature also.
One thing I would suggest is if the company could out an option for the customer that if want the protection cover also for the phone otherwise customer has to find it separately.

Charging &amp; heating problems
-----
I have purchased m31 on 16th March 2020, Very much Heating problem and charging time is more then 4hour of Samsung Galaxy M31- 6gb128 its totaly bogues phone.
I'm sorry to buy this phone, please don't buy from Amazon, they won't even service you and won't solve your problems, I'm a witness to it my money is gone.
-----
Wrost phone. Never purchased again sumsang phone
-----
Wrist phone. Samsung galaxy m31 is the worst phone which I never used before... I have purchased it in the month of March2020 and mobile recently automatically updated it software on 11th April, 2020. After that my mobile automatic anytime switch off, also normal mode/ without use suddenly switch off and after connecting charger is switc on phone sw and not working, screening is not working. Due to lock down I can't find any solution for this, please help me out on this
-----
Totally worth buy ,no regrets
-----
Camera quality is awesome excellent &amp; battery life also good but I didn't like keyboard option which can't support other languages as expected &amp; we need to download third-party app!!fingerprint is good but if it's placed on display screen instead of back side then it would be better but not a big issue
-----
It's not just a smartphone but I this revoluntionary device for this smartphone users.
-----
Before buying my new smartphone, I came across many products like Mi redmi note 8 pro. But It doesn't come amoled display and huge battery life. Apart from this, I would like to appreciate the performance of mobile during game time. Also, One UI 2 which is currently Samsung's latest UI version is also have best gestures and looks and it's easy to navigate through the apps. Last but not least, Camera including rear and front are just awesome with brilliant night photos and for the portrait ones.
-----
Megamonster with all features
-----
This product has very good performance. It has highest battery life which is 6000 mah. Fingerprint reader is also very effective and also the camera recognizes the face in a fraction of seconds. This is a fantastic camera mobile too with 64 MP quad camera. It also has selfie camera with 32 MP. The design looks very slim and beautiful. However, the keypad strucks sometimes when it is overused. It is the mobile with all the features i.e., camera(64 MP), battery life(6000 mah), sleek and stylish.
-----
Good,  bought for someone else as this is not phone for men
-----
Good phone , could have been better. At price is little higher compared to poco. Just bought this bcz of amoled display.. not expecting wonders with this phone as it has processor that cant compete with sd series. Buy it for ladies not for yourself. Game lovers stay away. Buy poco instead much better.

The best
-----
It is a monster indeed. The display is the best in the market under 20k. It is far better than the Chinese brands(The image quality of Chinese brands is just the worst when compared to this M31 image quality). The battery life is awesome. Its super slow-motion feature is really amazing. Totally worth every single penny.

Performances 4/5
Display 5/5

Samsung at it's best with top (mega monster) features..
Camera quality is just mind blowing with superb options ..
The AMOLED display with resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels and 403 ppi pixel density is just awesome..
 6Gb/128Gb - monster ram and space ..
Dont see the negative reviews just go for it ..
Best and worth mobile ..
RIP Redmi Realme ..
Thanks to AMAZON for the quick delivery...(bcz eventhough CORONA issues are going around they did their job clean )
-----
Imprecision while trying to provide many features in limited cost.
-----
1. Truely a mega monster in terms of battery backup , camera quality ( in terms of zooming it provides ) , samoled display.
2. Make sure that the product you get is free from defects . Proximity sensor of my m31 doesn't work perfectly .
3. Charging takes a lot of time (2.5 hrs for 0 to 100% ) as charger is of 15 w power.
4. I faced hanging problem which is faced by many others with other samsung smartphones.
Personally am not very happy with product due to hanging issue.
-----
Full value for money
-----
This phone is value for money. You cannot ask for a better phone than this in this price range.
Camera is good with all the effects of an high end phone. No lagging at all.
Works fluently.
I have been using it for the last 3 days without charging it, still I have 28 percent battery.
Sleek phone, easy to use, updated android version.
You cannot ask for a phone better than this in this or a slight above price range as well.
Well done Samsung..  a must have phone.
-----
M31 is budget phone
-----
Good looking mobile. Nice camera but disappointed in night vision and natural colors. Sharpness is low. Battery backup according to 6000mah is average in normal usage( 3-4calling &amp; 1-2hr internet maximum 36hr.. Fast charger is taking  more than 100mins for 20 to 100 .
Call on speaker not working properly.
Display quality is very good. Selfie camera is good. Overall in this budget phone is good but not very good
-----
Value for money with a little disappointment about camera.
-----
Best phone in this price level.  Overall performances are very good except camera.  Camera is far better than M30&amp;M30S but could be a little more better.  You can't use flash in 65MP and UHD resolution doesn't support video features. Apart from these..camera is fine.  Nice shots can be made easily with this one. Battery is the best part of the phone. No lag noticed in 4 days of use.  Sometimes heats up a little.. but it's negligible heating.
-----
Great value for money smartphone
-----
Whoh.Thats outstanding performance by M31.Really glad using this phone 15 days.Its working performance and battery is great.Battery hardly takes one hour to full charge.It lasts for using all around one and half days.Camera is also takes HD pics.Clearity and sharpness of image is good.Smooth operation while doing multitask.Samsung just launched this when I was looking for such phone with good camera and battery backup.
-----
Samsung M31
-----
Sleek design . It has got an excellent battery backup runs throughout the day.camera is just fabulous it got a clear image n pixels. Both rear and selfie camera comes with flash which is an added advantage.  Touch sensitivity is perfect. Processor is fast but could have been better compared to other models like one plus. I ordered it on the same day it was launched.  I would strongly recommend this phone to others. Overall it is a perfect model at nominal price.

Best budget smartphone
-----
The mobile is very smooth, touch works great and the display is amazing. I have over 150 apps installed and it works great even if a lot of them are open and I am working simultaneously.  The rear camera is awesome and very good for this range of smartphones. But the best part about this phone is its battery, if you are a heavy user then you can easily use it for 24 hours without charging,  if you are a moderate or light user then you can even use it for 2 days.

Amazing phone best Camera
-----
Bought new Samsung M31 after searching for good 3 months for a good camera phone...After using it for  couple of days I can tell you that It was worth waiting..This phone has an amazing camera with separate  macro n  telescopic lens among others. Pics clicked by this phone can give  photos of any flagship phone run for money. I can say with tons of other features it is the camera that stands out. This is the best camera phone under 15000/

Poor finishing of edges and poor quality of back pannel.

Awesome product. Reached expectations.. but I can't give 5stars  for the poor finishing and cheap quality back pannel,  and poor indentation at fingerprint spot which leads to confusion ...
-----
Am facing network issue
-----
Phone is getting heated. Network delay is there. It's taking a very long time for a call to get connected. Once a call is connected there is nearly a delay of 5 seconds in hearing the opposite parties voice. People are complaining that my voice is continuously breaking when I am speaking from this phone and the opposite parties voice is also continuously breaking and I couldn't hear them properly. Apart from this the other features of this phone and it's appearance are all very good.
-----
Great phone, budget friendly too
-----
Camera quality is too good for the price you pay. Enough storage space for many apps and games. Netflix and Prime is available in HD. Fingerprint reader is very fast. Battery life lasts for 1 day and next day half . Fast charger is there but it is better for overnight charging. Colour options are less but it is a great phone for price quality. The screen resolution is very good and night mode is there. Also blue light filter is also there which is very good.
-----
Best midrange mobile
-----
Samsung galaxy M31 is one of the best midrange mobile. I bought it just 15999.
1. Value for money.
2. Camera quality is very impressive  and super.
3. Display is amazing. Very high quality display.
4. Battery power is extraordinary.  Normal usage battery  backup is more than 2 days. Unbelievable  battery power.
5.looks very smart and slim. Not much weight.

Everything is perfect. It's the top best midrange mobile. No doubt.

I have purchased Samsung Galaxy M31 space black 6 GB RAM 64 GB storage from Amazon on 6th March 2020. After usage of last 10 days I have found following pros and cons of the Cell phone.
Pros:-
1) Stunning rear camera performance of 64 MP
2) Huge Battery of 6000 MaH with 15W fast charging option.
3) Low SAR value as compared to other cell phone.
4) Brilliant super almoled display.
Cons: -
 1) Back panel is of plastic built
2) Little bit heavier
-----
Complete Shutdown..
-----
My M31 has been off since 2 days now.. I was watching video on it and all of a sudden , screen went off and it was 40% charged that time... Phone is not responding after pressing power button.. And even after putting it on charger...
Bought this on launch date
-----
Awesome within range...
-----
Screen is awesome.. charger is of 15 watt only.. gives a warranty of 1 year.. screen guard or back cover ain't free.. there are Many inbuilt apps .. blue color suits awesome with the sleek design.. phone runs for a day or more.. 2nd sikal slot is not hybrid, so u can add an sd card along with it along with 2 nano sim cards. Android 10 is awesome. 6 GB RAM with such a processor makes it good gaming too (not awesome though). Camera is average. Plus its samsung, so u can have a trust.

Value for money

1. Camera quality is better at good light.
2. Battery life is good. Even if I continuously use internet it stands  6-7 hrs.
3. Finger print works fine.
4. Amoled display is awesome. But compared to A series it lacks quality.
5. While charging heats a lot.
6. Audio system(Dolby) is awesome with headset.
7. User interface is good.
8. Plastic body does it job by reducing the weight.
9. Curved edges give better handling.

Excellent mobile
-----
Ordered 6GB  variant at 1200 on 05th Mar 2020 and received mobile on the same day evening 0830 pm.
This is my first Samsung phone. Using this for 5 days and it would be best one in Mid range phones. Massive battery and 128GB is huge storage space. All applications and games are running smoothly. Yet to try COD and PUBg.
 Played Asphalt 9 and it was so smooth. Front camera was superb in video calls.
Worth mobile to buy.
-----
Smooth functioning and nice camera shot
-----
Design is very decent
The process is smooth.
Display is FHD.
Front Camera has unique features of click like selfie with palm show. Back camera has nice capture with quad cam.
Battery backup impressive.
Power charger works nicely to charge faster.
-----
Too much value for money
-----
It's too good phone. I am loving it üòç
Camera quality is best. Night Mode, macro mode, wide angle are really nice.
Front camera with 32MP is at it's best. Even if you zoom the photo taken by front am, to the fullest, pixels are pretty clear, no blur or image damge.
It's too much value for Money. Must buy if you want have a really good ph at this budget üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëåüèª
I am actually promoting, recommending this phone to family members!
-----
A 'M'arvel from Samsung.
-----
This is the best phone that you can ever ask for if your budget is under 16k. sAMOLED display, 6000 mah battery, 64 MP rear cam, 32MP front cam and the 6gb ram - 128gb rom combo are the deal breakers. Go for it blindly. I have used phones of redmi(xiaomi) &amp; realme previously. I can definitely vouch for the Samsung brand for all the above mentioned features. Thank you Samsung for such a marvel.
-----
Returning back
-----
Mobile touch display is not working once u lock the phone(not at all sensing our finger touch) it's really hard to unlock again and unlocking only after so many tries and it ll unlock  if there is a luck . Face unlock is  also poor. Mobile outlook is really good but disappointed with its performance. So today I requested for return and the process is initiated with amazon.  Thank u amazon for immediate response

The best in class and really a mega revolutionary monster
-----
Battery life is perfect when compared to the other smartphones .The best part of this mobile is the style of samsung through its glossy back surface ...SAMOLED Display which makes the touch feel very much appreciable and swift ....Camera is way beyond to be described wide angle with 64megapixel makes the picture look qualified with natural original look of the picture ...For all to say a most adaorable and lovable phone of the time within the budget and greater performance ...

Elegant MegaMonster from Samsung
-----
From galaxy grand-2 to M31, yet another benchmarked phone from Samsung. Bought it on 6th march. Amazing looks, features, fast processing of apps, camera and add-on features are simply superb splly slomotion captures, colours are so natural. And of course lastly the main reason to but this phone the #battery, the mammoth 6000mAh powerhouse is sufficient to spend up the day (even more) without any interruption for any working professional.. enjoy#befikar
-----

Tysm samsung india
@samsung
-----
Best phone but 2-3 thousands extra is taken for the product.
-----
I waited for the phone around 1 month and I don't regret it at all.
Sometimes gets slower,
Fewer times got hanged(personal experiences only)
Night camera is efficient enough not bad altogether.
Amazing interface and display,
Sound quality is good and touch is smooth.
Just a bit expensive than it should be
Overall best phone of Samsung under 18000.
"Keep updating the software Samsung".
You'll love the photography with the phone.
-----
Good for price!!
-----
Pros
Slim and sleek
Affordable
Decent specs
Lots of camera hardwares
Cons
Not that impressive battery life
It freezes occasionally
Camera is not that great
-----
Nice
-----
Good
-----
Best budget monster device..
-----
I was very much confused among redmi note 8 pro and m31 ... finally I bought m31 6/128gb variant because of its amoled display and battery.... believe me this device is awesome and very good User interface in this price range... u can  go for it..

-----
It's good for this price range and it has many features
-----
I got around  2 days battery life in single charge  but It takes much time for charging  6000 mah battery  approximately 2 and half  hour. My small suggestion  is  Samsung should have provided 25 watt charger instead of 15 watt. Camera clarity of the phone  is good as compared to other phones in this price range and the processor too. The fingerprint sensor and face recognition  is much faster and we can unlock the  phone  within 1 or 2 seconds.
-----
Camera and network
-----
Worst phone ever... autically booting up and got hanged up at samsung logo.. pls dont buy it and any of the samsung product especially made in india because these are not the quality products.

1.Facing some network issue...
As when being from no coverage or little coverage to proper coverage it take 5-10 minutes to restore the internet connectivity .
2. The front camera contrast is very smooth ,need some contrast and sharpness in the front camera
-----
Value for money . .
-----
Value for money product .i got 6/61 black colour ...nice one . Earlier

m using mi A3 now i can say the picture quality is same but little brightness in m31 . overall battery sound quality is nice specially amoled display is awesome .. i think nice and decent device at this price rang
-----
My first phone after my first job .
-----
A good buy , feels very good in the hand , camera is amazing , battery backup will last 24 hours even with heavy usage , doesn't feel like this phone is priced under 20 k , amazing build , screen quality is beautiful , go for it , no doubt.  Thanks Samsung , thanks Amazon.
-----
Samsung M31 the mid range beast.
-----
This phone is a beast. The things that could have been focused on are "Fast charging charger as the 6000 mah battery took almost 3 hours to get fully charged" &amp; "Back cover quality which seems to be cheap". Except these this phone fares really well with this price tag.
-----
Cool, compact and capable smartphone
-----
This phone is loaded with a powerful 6,000mAh battery along with improved cameras and sleek design. Camera quality is very good and The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach.The fingerprint sensor works just fine and not faced any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good and overall performance of phone is good.....
-----
Best phone for normal users with big battery life
-----
I chose this phone mainly because of its extended battery capacity, as I am a normal phone user it's a great advantage for me. I have been using this phone for fast 2 weeks and it's working well and the battery lasts for 2 days for a single charge. Overall it's a good phone.

Negatives:
Camera can be improved compared to other phones in this price range.
The charging speed is a bit low as it takes almost 3 to 3.15 hours to fully charge the phone.
-----
hardware issues....
-----
I bought this mobile in Amazon, i used only less than one month only phone is not working properly, hardware issues came in my phone. I didn't drop the phone anywhere even no scratch also happened in my phone.
suddenly my phone started restarting again and again and the following issues came,,
1. Mic is not working
2. Speaker is not working.
So be careful while buying this phone....
-----
Best budget smartphone
-----
Was waiting for this one. After using Samsung M30s for a while I moved on to use this. Has been a magnificent work from Samsung. With a huge battery and improved performance, display and camera - this will be the go to phone for youth. If you plan to use your phone for more than 2 years this is a must buy.
-----
You should definitely the m31
-----
Theres no way you wouldnt want to buy this phone. Lets talk about it in pros and cons. Pros- its massive 6000 mah battery packed along with a super amoled screen and a camera with a superior quality in its price range would definitely blow your experience to a whole other level. The only con I felt along with this device is that other companies provide at least a earphone or a mobile cover along with the handset. However this is not the case with m31 thats very sad

Samsung nailed it Battery and camera very good Pub g also working nicely
-----
‚ù§‚ù§Best phone ever in so good price.I played pub g for about 4 hours non stop and then too only 33% battery consumed.The camera is very nice with nice features such as macro shot,slow motion ,food and many more.The game launcher is a good feature and the phone is also not too heavy with so big mah battery.You should buy it.Its better than redmi 8 pro.Samsung nailed it.
-----
As per price and brand, after using for 2 week phone disappoint me badly.
-----
Fingerprints reader is good as other brand like mi note 8.
Camera is good as per Samsung m series.
Battery life is just ok ok bcoz I am using with less apps still it works for one day only.
Feel some hanging problem and response is slow as usual with other Samsung phone.
Face recognition is not so good working slow and some time working and some time giving suggesting to unlock via other security unlock option.
I would like to give 2.5 out of 5.
-----
Waited long 3years for an ideal midrange phone!got it..
-----
I was waiting for 3 years for the right phone. Right price. Best of features in a midrange segment.Really happy to have found the right phone.Great camera.Being a doctor-long battery life really supports my work schedule.apart from the backside being a fingerprint magnet for my oily hands"no backcover provided with the pack"..its really handy!superamoled display is just lit!and a lightning fast delivery by amazon prime.
-----
Excellent in all performance
-----
I purchased 02 x Samsung galaxy m31 mobiles, one is ocean blue and another is space black.

The phone is excellent in all performance, I never saw  this type of mobile of any company at this price to collision to this phone.

Brilliant in all. Quality camera, battery, lovely LED display, software performance, excellent memory, excellent processor, and all.

I think it is the best mobile in India in 2020.  The brand SAMSUNG.  Love it.
-----
A great budget Galaxy phone.
-----
So its been amost 10 days using this device and I must share that I'm happy with the performance of it.The delivery was done next day only which was impressive,the Galaxy M31 comes with fairly basic packaging. Apart from the device itself, you get a 15W fast charger and a charging/data cable.
Prior to this i was using realme 3 pro and M31 suprasses that in every aspects whether it is camera,one ui 2.0,design or battery.Overall it is a good buy in this price.
-----
Good product but battery charging is slow and not seems 6000mah
-----
Battery not seems 6000mah ,it looks like 3000mah, heating problem  as wel  as keypad  hangs  some time
-----
Over all phone is mindblowing in this segment
-----
My self k.c.meena
M31 was purchased by me on first day sale, it's a great deal on that price for this amazing mobile
1. Battery capacity is no doubt great with great battery monitoring feature
2. Camera again awesome and its qualities are more than I phone
3. Fingerprint sensor need to improve. It may be more sensitive
 Samsung again set the mindset of the people"we are number one in the world
-----
Overall mega happiness over mini price
-----
As per given specifications phone runs without any lag or hang till my 5 to 6 days of usage as also nowdays they are showing of refresh rate and all but the swipes are also smooth with great display and now come to gaming and processor is like great and wow in this price range and as samsung camera is the which all of you know but the battery is also mega as given it lasts upto  1or 1.5 days easily
-----
Camera is bad. Others ok
-----
Camera need to improve by update. It is samsung sensor but detail is not good in picture and night photo is too bad.if samsung fix camera issue then it is best balanced phone in price. Processor is enough for normal uses but not for heavy gaming. Biggest issue in this phone is night picture and detail in picture.
-----
A Good Buy
-----
This comes with allot of features in a budget of 16000. The phone gives you an amazing camera, good battery compared to other samsung smart phone, front camera iz really good. The phones comes out with a really good screen which provides a great video quality.

Though, it does not have a secure folder, samsung pay feature, and many othr such deautre. Phone is definately not for gamers, it though supports games but the graphics must be set to medium.

M31 is a great phone with  features person looks
Decent battery backup.
Processor good enogh to operate multiple apps.
Camera quality is good, front camera is above avg.
Display S.Amoled is doing a great job.
At last my gaming experience is good for PUBG, but I feel 6GB ram is still lacking.(I use to play on iphone7 that was on 2gb. Not comparing ios 2gb to this Samsung 6gb but still it was good). Else this phone is doing a great job.
-----
Super Phone
-----
Realy Monstar Camera..Night ligh is better capture.
And oyher Overall performance is good.
I am happy with this phone and I always love Samsung product from my begining android phone and this phone is my 5th purches.
-----
Value for money.
-----
The phone looks promising in terms of features at the price it is offered at.
cons:
1. Battery is not living upto the expectation which was claimed by manufacturer.
2 the sound output from speaker is less which becomes difficult to listen in noisy environments.
3. In screen fingerprint  scanner is something sported by all other phone manufacturers should have been incorporated.
-----
Awesome Mobile
-----
This is my first review of online shopping.

I bought Sumsung galaxy M31 (space black, 6GB,128gb storage) at launch day 5 the March.

Mobile is awesome. Features are good.
Both (front &amp; backend) camera pictures quality also awesome. Battery life is very good. I charged only 2 Time in this 5days.
I have used many mobiles but I am getting awesome feeling by using this mobile.

Also it delivered within 18 hrs without prime
-----
Go For It... You'll be happy...
-----
Amazing phone in this price range.
Battery is superb it gives me more than two days backup on average use.
Camera is preety nice. Some camera shots I'm going to post here so you can go through the camera sample.
Super amoled screen is superb.
Touch response is good enough .
Fingerprint sensor is quite responsive.
Android 10 is out of the box.
Over all amazing product, value for money.
Thanks to amazon for fast delivery.
-----
Very good mobile in related range
-----
I have purchased this mobile on first day launch, and happy with all features. Mobile battery is excellent and till date satisfied with processing speed with screen resolution. Camara is good, but it can be best.
-----
Not Worthy.
-----
Face recognition is not working, battery 6000mah but running life i dont think soo, camera (self and rare camera) is not upto the mark.
Recent update, phone claims that it is packed with gorilla glass 3 (display) samsung making people fools.
My phone accidentally fell down from below 0.5meter (half meter) height, with that height my phone isn't survived.
-----
*True flagship: Thanks to Samsung :-)*
-----
Awesome device, and hats off to amazon for such speedy delivery.
And so far I m absolutely loving this device, buttery smooth and blazing fast. But its a bit big, afterall 6.4 inches is quite a number. Worth every buck.

Again, Samsung M31  has involved and presented a better-shaped handset.
- Amazing display quality and the curved edged display.
- Best in class camera.
- Better battery life and charging.
-----
Review after using 2 weeks
-----
Finger print is little bit slower but okay. Can have better and faster response at this price range as the other companies are providing better fingerprint sensors at this price.

Camera is awesome. No issue at all

You dont feel like you are using 6000mAh batteries mobile. Mobile is not that much heavier. But battery life also need to be looked into as it is not giving 1.5 day charge at least.
-----
Mega waste
-----
Mega monster i like this name but the phone totally waste..
Display is good and we all know samsung provide good display quality and battery is okay
Camera performance is not good i suggest if you have plan to huy this phone don't buy this mega monster..better to buy other model

Am awestruck at the photo quality and clarity,  has large battery life am charging once in 3days...Hats off to Samsung to bring this type of quality product to the market and that too at an affordable price... Thanks SAMSUNG... Thanks again...
-----
Decent phone
-----
Battery and camera is good
The main thing is chipset. Samsung can upgrade the exynos 9611 to snapdragon 730g or mali g90t. But Samsung use the oldest chipset. But the phone is decent.

Samsung m31 review after 15 days usage
-----
Front cam is bad. Finger print scanner and backpanel has a slight gap which gathers dust around it. Face unlock and fingerprint lock is a bit slow though. Battery works okay. If backpanel was also made of gorilla glass it would be better as it gets dusty and greasy every time u use it. phone is heavy. Back Cam doesnt look even close to 64 mp. The so called front screen broke after falling from a very small height.
-----
Segment's best mobile by Samsung
-----
Segment's best mobile by Samsung:
6000 MAh battery is sufficient to use approx 2 days. Main rear camera is 64 MP, no one can beat it.
Killer performance by exynos 9611.
Good design with 4 camera combination.....
-----
Awesome Samsung Galaxy M31(6GB/128).. it's worth of money
-----
This is my 2nd phone of Samsung company which I have bought personally..I have decided that I will use Samsung company mobile only but I was looking for great options with affordable price..

If i talk about fingerprint reader is awesome,technically work 100%, Camera quality is quite good from other company mobile and if i speak about battery, it is really monster of battery

This M31 is really awesome...anyone can bought this phone personal use without any doubt..
-----
Worthy purchase
-----
Do not see the negative  comments and withdraw your decession  on buying this phone this is a good phone in this price segment and the cameras are good too better than note 8 pro in almost every aspect and also in terms of ui highly  recommended product for heavy users .but not recommended for  heavy games who wish to play 6-7 hours of pubg. Excellent  phone for daily usage and media consumption go for it.one of the best phone under 15k
-----
Best phone in its category. Just go with it
-----
Excellent phone by Samsung. My first Samsung phone. I am 5.5 years Mi fan. I was waiting for Note 9 Pro but after launch of Note 9 Pro, I decided to go with another brand. I was looking for Super AMOLED screen &amp; big battery. So I decided Samsung M31. Although it is not having very fast charger. Even though it is best in its class.

Best parts are:
Screen
Camera
Sound
Call quality
Weight
Battery
-----
Wastage of money
-----
This phone other than battery backup is a waste of money I have recently bought it the speakers don't work properly  sound quality of speakers is very bad, camera quality I'd average don't go by the camera specifications and advertisements and the phone I have bought has major sound problems the sound just shuts itself. It goes mute itself when I am listening to music even in ringing mode phone just vibrates and nothing else speakers doesn't  work properly
-----
Absolutely worth the price.
-----
I bought the phone basically for two purposes.
Internet surfing and movie watching. The Mega battery and super amoled display does absolute justice to my cause and the price. No complaints at all. Battery lasts well over a day and the screen is very good.
-----
Must buy ... Have same features like Samsung A51 worth 24k ü§£
-----
This blue M31 is beautiful nd battery power is about 1.5 day including night also if we charge is full  ... charging is easy with 15w fast charger  .. super amoled display with good quality sound ... good for gaming nd camera quality is also good .. the slow motion is fab with their camera and is very smooth for making Tiktok videos üòç ...

-----
You can see many photos/videos of mobile on google or YouTube. So i wanna just tell you  M31 is a longtime useful phone because a brand Samsung ,good built quality, good camera and 6 gb/128 gb variant make it special..i purchase this variant.. night day light conditions photos pity good comparisons to other mobiles like poco and xiomi 9 pro. Images details also improved by Samsung. I received this mobile as a gift on my 2nd anniversary. Thankx lot my love
-----
Super Awesome phone !!
-----
This is my 3rd Samsung phone till now and definitely the best and after 2 days of use I can say it is Mega and Monster of a phone with superb camera, very high battery life, amazing display, and lightning quick due to 6GB Ram.
At 15999 it is a best buy when compared to other Chinese brands as you have trust of SAMSUNG.
Just go for it üôÇ
-----
Super battery and screen quality
-----
I am writing this after 2 weeks of use.
Overall , I am impressed on different aspects of the phone.
Standout pros are :-
1. super long battety(lasts 2 days with moderate use)
2. Screen quality amazing, watching videos are quit fun even from acute angles
3.  Wide angle view of the camera is awesome

Cons so far:
1. Phone hangs sometimes(once a day)
  Especially on YouTube,  also the keypad has  stuck few times

Disappointing
-----
I bought this one as they mentioned 6000mah battery
But
1.Battery drains quickly.. doesn't perform like 6000mah capacity....
2. Temperature increases while making calls and charging
3. Camera quality is good n daylight.. but poor in low light
-----
Phone is awesome overall but no earphones included
-----
I was really disappointed when I figured that there were no eardphones included in brand new Galaxy M31. And when I searched in faq I got to know that Samsung India wants to gives flexibility to users. This is ridiculous that you now want users to buy earphones separately. At least you should provide basic earphones. The phone is good but I am shocked to know the no earphones are included while some companies have even started giving phone covers also.
-----
Not as good as expected
-----
After usage of almost 15 days I concluded that battery is not as expected. It takes 2.5 to 3 hours to get fully charged and drained in a day even after normal usage.

Earlier I had moto one power which had 5k mah battery which was far better then this.

Over all performance is satisfactory but battery performance disappointed so far. It works like 3k mah.
-----
Good to buy under  this budget
-----
Good mobile under this budget and camera is decent and display is very good but battery  is not up to 6000 and it looks like 3500.over all is good and also facing wifi connectivity  issue and need to connect offenly  after phone call eventhough auto connect option is enabled. Camera quality is good. Battery life is not good but just ok..fingerprint reader is good
-----
After using the mobile for one month
-----
The phone is really superb and an excellent choice for normal usage.. Battery back up is massive and no need to worry even if you play heavy graphics games.. Display and Camera quality are awesome and comparatively equal and better than other mobiles at this price segment.. My friend is using iPhone 7 plus and he is asking my m31 as exchange to his iPhone...I really love the Pixel clarity and display clarity.. You can blindly buy the mobile without any negative thought...
-----
Value for money?
-----
At this price range it's good buy. Back panel should have been more scratch resistant. Or else Samsung should have provided a basic back panel , and why there are no ear phones ( for15999) , Samsung could have provided one.
Other than that every thing seems good as of now, will update after 1 month use.

Touch sensitivity  - Very good
Battery backup - good
Camera - Good
Screen - good

I got very much irritated when the phone gets heated just in the first charging and I have to use it when it's heated like cake!!! I don't know what's the reason.  But I wanted to return and go for  redmi note 9. But still want to feel this phone because this is my first Samsung phone.

1. Picture and Video or Camera quality is really good.
2. Gaming performance  is also good.
3. Storage 128gb and expandable memory slot gives us the feature of storing loads of files.
4.Has a battery life almost  1 and half days
Cons
1. Since 15w charger its little slow to get charged.
2. Some times phone gets heated on continues usage.
-----
This is the  worse phone I ever bought.
-----
I never tried Samsung gadgets and in the era of so many new phones, I thought to give this phone a try.
But this phone is trouble, the processing is so slow, the phone Is very heavy. The camera is okay but not good. It's been 3 days I bought the phone and I had put a guard and back cover still the display is dead. I have never seen any display as well as the screen so weak that it can't bear a small tear.Amazon people were also not very helpful.
-----
Worth it very nice quality and product
-----
Very nice quality, one day delivered, powerful battery.. over all fardu phone hai baap.. I am totally satisfied and very happy with this phone, almost 15 days I am using this I do not got any kind of issue, camara is wow!!. processing is so fast and guys don't ask me about battery it is huge monster betry almost you will need to change on 3rd day when you fully charged this. at last I would suggest Go for it without thinking...

Buttery Smooth
-----
This device is a charm to use.  The One UI is fluid and display...OMG : The Best.
Everything is just perfect in this phone. The Widevine support with Dolby Atmos is heaven for binge watchers. Games's experience is also good.
The Battery usually lasts 2 days after normal usage.
The Camera is exceptionally well according to its price.
I just love Samsung.
-----
Not recommend
-----
Phone is not recommended
During calls I am facing few issues  like call recording will start automatically or call will go on hold. These could be due to sensitivity  issues and placement of additional menu close to face touch. Never faced these  issues  in my prior  mobiles.
-----
Worth every penny.üòÑ
-----
Amazing product. Camera quality is very nice, rear camera gives crystal clear pic thiugh I would recommend a little working on the front facing camera. The 6bg-128gb variant is the best as you get a pretty good ram and heavy storage capacity and it would last long. Product design is very attractive and gives a rich look and I must say they do have value of money. It is worthevery penny you spent. Over all I am more than satisfied with the device.üòä

Overall good expect Camera
-----
Overall performance of Samsung M31 is good. But really unhappy with the camera quality. Picture quality does not match with 64 MP camera, even resolution is also very poor. In Macro mode, there is no any option for auto focus. Totally unsatisfied camera performance. May be Samsung will update and improve it's camera software for M31 later on.

Best Smartphone ever. There are plethora of wonderful features. Addition of Assistant Menu is additional highlight for the mobile. Holding this smartphone makes me even prouder than holding my iPhone. I exchanged my favourite iPhone to get this wonderful device. Camera is awesome. Have recommended my friends to buy this exquisite smartphone. It is definitely a Monster among all mobiles.
-----
Best deal till March2020 to buy.
-----
Loved the phone.
THE BEST DEAL IN ‚Çπ16000 FOR NORMAL PERSON.

Pros-
Massive battery.
Descent Camera (NOT THE BEST BUT NOT BAD AT ALL).
Fingerprint sensor is pretty fast.
Processor is not the best but still a better one.
No heating issues -Played Pubg(HDR, ULTRA), Clash of clan

Cons-
Charging is really slow.
Face unlocking is not at all fast.
Missing that 8gb ram with 128gb variant.
-----
Worth 14999 actually more than that
-----
A master stroke by samsung.the camera, battery,fingerprint amd most important display and the smooth touch  its awesome. Actually samsung mobile feels premium in hand. If you want a mobile with good quality and function i reccomend this than purchasing low quality device of other brands.
I used samsung device previously and there customer support is increadible they value customer
-----
After using for 1 week.
-----
Meanwhile using this device, i find it slow with respect to the 6gb ram mobile devices.
It is taking time in switching apps, opening apps and sometimes getting stuck until i clear the memory.
Also I'm unable to find what is using half(3gb) of my ram as only 2.9 gb is available to use after clearing memory. (500mb of ram is reserved).
Camera is good.
Display is good.
-----
Decent Phone
-----
Screen is Excellent
Battery works very Good
External Speaker is  loud enough
Camera is Decent
Software is very good
Ads and Bloatware can be Personalized
Performance for gaming is OK PUBG &amp; Asphlt 9 works OK enough
Plastic Back Build Gets Scratched very easily no gorilla protection on Back cover so i
No Screen Guard and Back Cover included
USB cable is short
-----
One of the  best mobile in which best features are available.
-----
M31 is very impressive.  Battery  backup  is very good, camera quality  is very good. Finger print and face scan is good. Smooth  multitasking.  Watching  movies  on m31 is best experience . There are also good. Performance  to manna padega m31 ka,makhkhan k jaisa. Slowmtion ka to addict ho gya. Camera picture pure nikhar k aata h. Front camera is awesome. Design  is pretty impressive.  Price v sahi h. Aur kya batayenge. Words ni mil rhe hüòä
-----
Really Megamonster
-----
Battery is very good but 15watt charger not good Or Camera quality good but Front camera not good knox security Samsung smartphone best security but this handset no security features is better fingerprint or face lock is fast  all over best smartphone in other smartphone or no cover no tempered glass in the box is bad but No problem  that's Smartphone are All over Allrounder Smartphone in the 2020 in mid range smartphone
-----
A true value for money phone!!
-----
Finally a budget phone which is truly a flagship killer. A blind choice for specially those who extensively use their phone all day long till late night. 6000 mAh says it all!! Macro lens is a very good add to the phone and like always Samsung is very good with its display but to providing it to a budget phone is also an added benifit.
The best part about this phone is even though it has such a big battery spec it feels light and good to hold.
-----
Phenomenol on 16K
-----
Terrific Phone on this Budget......The Quad "Camera Quality" is phenomenol....lots of new camera options also. The 6000mah "Mega Battery" is huge with terrific back up power.....The amoled display also looks superb.....The audio with dolby atmos is good....The phones Non-Mettalic body also look superb.....
I am writing this Review After using it for 10-12 days ........Very good one on 16k.....ü•∞

Very good smartphone.
-----
This is the first time I bought a Samsung smartphone and it also fulfil my all expectations which I had on it.
It‚Äôs camera quality is very good and it‚Äôs monster 6000mAh battery is really fabulous.

It‚Äôs built quality is not so bad and not so good.
If want to buy it please go ahead.
But I advice u to don‚Äôt use it without cover, because the scratches will spoil it‚Äôs decent look

And over all it is very good.
-----
Nice Phone in the mid range segment
-----
It's almost a week using M31 and overall satisfied with the outcome so far. Like the Camera which is actually a good one specially in night mode. The battery back up of the phone is ultimate and I spend 1 and half day without any powerbank on standby mode on touring. The plastic back of the phone might be not like by most of the user as the fingerprint can easily seen. However, it's a good phone to us especially when SAMSUNG associated with
-----
SAMSUNG GALAXY M31 is actually a MEGA MONSTER
-----
Excellent rear and front cameras

Display is amazing.

Fast fingerprint sensor  it worked every time without fail.

Battery is very good I get about 2 day of battery backup and it also charges 0-80 % quite fast considering its 6000mah battery.

It's very durable it actually fell from the balcony and survived with just minor scratches at the back.

User interface and Gaming is also quite good.
-----
Battery monster. Overall nice phone
-----
Long lasting device
-----
Battery is the main attractive factor and it lives upto its potential......just went 3 days with average usage!!!!!

Camera is okayish....does the job gr8

Multitasking with the processor observed some slowdowns but overall averge smoothness and crispness when phone starts or switching between apps

Lastly the screen is just wow even under sunlight :)
-----
Awsome phone
-----
It is awsome phone with powerful exynos 9736 processor which make the phone smooth and faster compared to any other budget smartphone and also with 64MP quad rear camera the photo are more natural. With this phone Users can play PUBG mobile at HDR setting without and lag or heating issue. It also had superAmolade display and 60HZ screen refresh rate .over all in my openion it is the best budget phone than redmi and realme and also oppo .
-----
Good for this price by Samsung
-----
Screen as it says is SAMOLED is truly wonderful.
Camera both fromt and back serves the purpose.
Fingerprint i am bit disappointed,  as it is not as fast as it should be and battery life as it says 6000mah, but i believe it work as around 4750mah which is 1 day on full charge and after having video call for 2hrs and normal use.
But charging is fast as it says at 15W.
Overall at this price one should really go fir this.
-----
Best phone nd worth money #MonsterMega #love
-----
I personally love all the specifications of this M31...camera is awesomeand very clear images...and price point is perfect...i had bought 6 gb 128 version...and i am big fan of samsung phones specially super amoled screen no one has like this...and battery is very powerful...6000Mah lasts for 1and half days when you are very hard user...i personally recommen this best phone in the market dont go with other brand i just suggest you guys...

-----
Great Package if you are looking for a brand
-----
Awesome Display....5* just for the Display.Not a gamer though maybe that's why I am perfectly okay with the performance....battery is okayish I would say doesn't perform like 6000mah ...camera is meh! Seriously doesn't feel like 64 mp...photos in daylights are above average but boy it completely fails at night....feels like Samsung put a good display along with some cheap hardware in a package in the name of fancy title
-----
Key points-Good battery life, amazing  camera, awesome  display with customization
-----
Really good phone  with long battery  life and  I love super AMOLED  display if you are looking  for good battery  life phone with best Display and camera the  go for it . I'm not gaming  lover and I have not tried  any game in this phone I'm using  this phone  from last 5 days this one is really good
Heating  issue found  during  video call like 3 to 4 hours  not high like Chinese  phones
-----
Best all-rounder among budget segment phones with Samsung brand name on it!
-----
Great display- super AMOLED (class apart)
Great battery 6000mah (easily stands for more than 2days for normal users like me)
Above average camera (expected more from 64MP)
Fast fingerprint sensor
One UI - good one (unwanted apps can be uninstalled)
Weightless
Dolby atmos with headsets an added advantage
-----
Must buy
-----
Camera: Verygood
Display: verygood
Battery: verygood..charges takes more than 3hrs to charge.
Sound: very good
Fingerprint: verygood
After using 3 months i found only one issue that is charging issue.samsung should have provide fast charger.30w

M31 BEST UNDER 15K RANG RANGE
-----
This is the best device under 15k range. I have purchased 64Gb space black device. Fingerprint scanner is really very smooth it unlocks device very fast. Camera set is really very good you can take the best quality pictures from rear and front camera as well. If you will trun of the animation from the device the battery life is also very good. Highly satisfied with the device.
-----
Best for Everyday use
-----
To be honest it's the best mobile to purchase on this range. It's not a gaming mobile.  But when it comes to daily  basic needs you can go for it and you will love it. Camera is great. Overall performance is good. You can play PUBG with HDR mode for 1hr smoothly .It's a package of entertainment. Display is amazing.
Upgraded processor would be the best job. Knox security and Samsung pay is not available.
-----
I exchange my A6plus for this phone..I'm happy
-----
I'm really satisfy with the set..All u will feel surprise that I was exchange mt A6plus and took this phone..I have no regrets..Number one phone in the market and I quite loved it.
-----
Automatically restarting
-----
Don't buy this phone, I bought this phone in end of March, 2020. The phone is automatically restarting some time and to switch on, it will take more longer time compare to normal restarting. Very bad quality. Not good response from Amazon as well as manufacturer.
-----
Value for money
-----
Worth for the money paid,
Battery lasting for 1 complete day
Camera is good ,
Comparing to other M series phone,It has some additional features.
Look wise phone is not up to mark,but its slim...

Honest review
-----
This is my first trusted branded gadget like 'samsung' previously I was used MI compare with this is superb especially battery, Display, Processor, SAR value and camera. Decent price and comfortable device ,I don't view design and glass body ,it's nice look nd most important think is light weight with massive 6000 mah battery really nice work of samsung. I am recommended for businesses nd professional people ,I feel user friendly..

Changing my review today
-----
I got my Galaxy M31 delivered on 13 March 2020. Today there was an update which unfortunately failed. Phone shows a blue screen with "Downloading do not turn off target" message and some error codes. Not able to use the phone for anything. It is sitting like a brick. IMMEDIATE HELP REQUIRED. Samsung website failing to address the issue. Refund/Replacement/Resolve.
-----
VALUE FOR MONEY =M31
-----
JUST A MASTERPIECE BY SAMSUNG.
IF YOU LOOKING FOR BUDGET SMARTPHONE WITH BATTERY AND CAMERA AS PRIORITY THIS ONE IS BEST.

CAMERA 64MP IS AWESOME DAYLIGHT SHOT IS TRULY BEAUTY.
BATTERY RUN FOR FULL DAY WITH MOVIES,GAMES,MUSIC,ETC.

TRULY MONSTER.

This is a nice product.... as a youtuber i use this for video editing... i get approx 1.2 days battery life... nice camera and i use it for video shoot also but colors combination is just some high but nice... i enjoy it and also 4k video just awesome and also its screen touch is faster than your thinking... its fingerprints is mindblowing fast... just awesome product... i like this.. love this... thank samsung... for this product
-----
The best phone, at this price
-----
For this price, there cant be a better phone. The fingerprint reader is a little slow, but overall, this phone can't be better. The Ram and storage is more than perfect, I can go hours playing PUBG or COD, with no lagging. And the camera, i compared my M31's camera to my friend's iPhone 11 pro max, and our friends couldn't make out the difference, so you know your camera is best, when it's being compared to a 1 lakh INR phone
-----
Everything is fine, just only espect improvement in screenshot functionality
-----
Everything looks okay,  easy to use, working good, just one issue of screenshot functionality,,,
I desire to have some multi function for screen shots, screen video records,  fully, short  ,and mini screenshot function,  especially in some like Samsung Galaxy m 31 phone.
Hope it's improved or upgraded next time.
Moreover it good for all aspects..
-----
Mega features in reasonable prices
-----
Samsung M31 comes with a smooth touch mega amoled screen which gives a very nice user experience. The camera quality of 64MP is really up to the mark. Long lasting 6000mah battery is  something you can not ignore in this mobile.
The only thing which is missing here is a earphone which doesn't  come with the package. Price of the M31 6+128 is also very much reasonable.
Overall experience  is great. Keep up the good work.
-----
A very nice phone for the given price....
-----
It's a good choice after using redmi phones..the ui is awesome ....battery is nice ..camera is good..I m not a gamer but  for everyday  use it's a good phone....if you want a change after using redmi/realme/and other similar brands..u will love this phone under same price bracket......
-----
Don't buy Samsung or Amazon will not help you
-----
Camera is falthu, I am a samsung lover... but this defect Model is waste don't take it...camera just like front camera 2mega pixel....back camera is just 8mega pixel... and its don't  have replacement or refund option in amazon... Amazon customer service is waste no one helped me to digonsses mobile and my got waste am looking for replacement and Samsung need to keep the promise about features.... really waste mobile don't buy
-----
Overall Good Mobile
-----
I am using Samsung Galaxy M31 last one week.
Upon my usage I am writing this review.
Battery life is very good - full charge after viewing videos continuously one and half day.
Camera is very good - back camera is very good

I am only disappointed with finger print sensor.
Comparing to other mobiles it's taking more time to sense.
And brightness adjustment also sometimes not working properly.

Got stuck while installing update and cannot recover mobile.
-----
After one month of using phone when i tried to update system it got stuck at installing update.
Tried using volume down and power button but it again stuck at same point. Contacted samsung customer care online they suggested to contact service center physically after lockdown. :(
Till lockdown i will not be able to use whereas we need mobile most in these days.
-----
A best buy phobe better than few best costly phones in market
-----
Its the best value for money i have put hands on...infact after using this phone i have stopped looking at battery status it self... as one single full recharge of night lasts  like forever... and yes I am tireless gamer playing clash royal and pubg  umpteen times during the day. Camera is so clear and better both front back...besides ultra hd modes of PubG are supported so you can imagine how powerful it is. I am super happy
-----
Phenomenal Piece By Samsung and In Budget
-----
It is a phone with magnificent battery life and the look it give.
The Samsung Camera is something you even can't think of .
So Many Functionalities included such as stabled video shooting which is as same as any cinematic film.
Camera Lover must go for it
Battery Life awesome with 2 days using full playing pubg,using Netflix and Just using like a hell whole day.
16k is worth to spend
Go for it.
-----
Go for it, it is worth buying
-----
The phone is excellent in each and every performance matrix. Be it battery life, camera, sound quality, display. I have stopped looking at battery percentage after purchasing this phone, such is the battery life this phone is offering us. It has been almost a week of using this phone and till now the experience is fantastic.
-----
A great deal
-----
Using samsung galaxy M31 more than a week ,experience is awesome. Good display ,even visible in sun light.camera is great 64mp gives the best shots I have ever taken before. 6GB is more enough to play games without any hassle and supports graphics and smooth gaming experience. Stylish and handy model to use .Finger print sensors are so quick .It has Dolby atmos gives surrounded sounds when used in head phones.Just superb.

Got Amazing Galaxy M31 by Amazon
-----
It is a very good phone, especially you don't get such brilliant features for such price. Ocean blue color of the phone is amazing, very attractive. Fingerprint reader is fast. Camera quality is amazing and 6000mah battery is giving backup for more than 36 hrs.
I am completely satisfied with this product, it is worth... thanks Amazon for smooth product delivery.

Excellent Mobile
-----
I have been searching for long time to get new mobile for Battery life.
Finally, I brought S31 mobile.
1. Excellent Battery Life and it comes more than one day with data enabled
2. No HEAT in mobile while taking.
3. No vibration feeling when i kept in shirt packet.
4. Very good screen pixel but single image size around 9+ MB if use 64 pixel.
-----
Impressive phone in this budget.
-----
Pros: great battery life it can run for about 2 to 3 days on 1 charge.
It's got a great camera.
It's quite fast.
The screen is very responsive.
It's got  a great screen quality the images are quite clear on it.
Cons:
When I first started the phone, the apps took a long time for updating and I was unable to install any apps. This was rectified by switching off the phone then switching it on.
-----
A very good bargain for money at this price
-----
The Camera Quality is quite good. However  would have liked Pro mode to be better with more manual controls. Fingerprint reader is slower compared to my old mobile but doesn't disappoint in any way. Battery life is enough for a day's use with moderate activity. Given the  battery size, better battery life expected. The mobile is a bit heavier and somewhat lags in performance but makes up for it in the features provided.

Reviewing the Samsung Galaxy M31
-----
The phone is quite good. Its Fast as it have a 6 GB Ram. It have an Amazing Battery life of 6000 mAh which last for  a full day without charging while playing games and doing stuffs. It has a good camera 64 MP and a good video recording at 2160p@30fps, 1080p@30fps. The bad thing in this mobile is that it don‚Äôt not come with an earphones while having an earphone jack. That very disappointing. Overall it is a MegaMoster.
-----
Perfect one for me
-----
At this price point.... It is the beat option... But if you are a pubg oriented person.. It is on moderate performance level. Exynos 9611 is really amazing but snapdragon gives better performance than this one. Everything else is perfect.. Amazing
-----
Just good
-----
I give 4*for fingerprint reader where 2* for camera quality as camera is not to the score of 64 or 32 Mp rather seems 12 mp and 8 mp. Battery charging is too late not to the standard of fast charging it is taking 3 hours to fully charged. Amazon reply to replacement is harassing
-----
Handset hetting problems
-----
Cell on time instantly screen and back side temperature 38 to 41 degrees. Not possible hearing and handling. I am getting some mobail with temperature sencer pictures. Other wise mobail all functions and options is good. Battery working only 8 to 9 hours. I am trying 2 handset but same problem than I am returns back mobile.
Still I am not receive money. Please send money my account.
Thank regard.

A happiness in every sense
-----
The one thing that samsung have that non other has is quality. I'm happy with the phone. The fingerprint quality is far better than its competitor models which I personally feel. Battery is a huge asset to this model and deserves much kudos to its performance. I find great joy using the camera in night mode which gave me a new experience.

Finaly, I found something better than anything which I've ever tried.
-----
Not satisfied with the performance
-----
Was not at all satisfied with the product. This product did not meet the expectations. Went by the users review and got the phone. But personal experience did not go well. Frequently gets hanged. 6gb RAM should owe even more, but this product did not turn up like that. If there is any software bug, I personally request for the update of the software atleast by the next version.

Pros - camera quality is good
-----
Tottaly satisfied for this awesomeness
-----
Great camera quality and great safety features in the phone...the phone is fully packed with features....the super amoled display is soo good and infact both the cameras front and back are awesome...the only minus point is battery...it not that it becomes very low in usage of some time...but if u charge your phone in night at 100% then it will go for the whole day...otherwise awesome phone really..

A companion at the time of corona
-----
To keep oneself home during this Corona emergency one must have a phone with higher battery life. It does it. I have been using this phone hours together on FB and youtube... but the battery is learning my style and giving me more. The camera is good enough for the time as I am not going out often. The fingerprint is the best. Basically the phone reads my moods :)
-----
Just okay
-----
Battery life is good ,fingerprints some time sharp &amp; some time delay &amp; no single screen guard in m31 phone also no earphone but camera function  is not good need to simplify &amp; improvement if you are using main camera flashlight you can't use it. Lots of improvement need in all cameras function. Some time few applications  work very slow . I not happy with cameras

Totally cost cutting  phone

Best for phone for entertainment but slow charging
-----
Display quality is very amazing, battery backup is very impressive u can use ur phone for two days with single charge with high usage...but the phone lacks in body material u need to use a case otherwise it will get scratches in a week..and other doubt is that it has slow charging even after having fast charger (in box)..may be bcoz of bigger battery. Camera is also very good and super steady mode is wonderful...
-----
Good phone with some hiccups

My finger print and touch screen is not working hence facing severe problems. Adaptive accidental lock has been initiated on its own having problems now as I am not able to do anything.

With 6 Gb Ram 128 GB memory, dual SIM &amp; a dedicated card slot, 6000 MAh battery and a decent camera ... What more could you ask for in 16000/- ... Bought 2 for my wife and self and upgraded from Samsung A9 Pro which had outlived its life ... "Itne mein bachhe ki jaan lo ge kya" ... Good phone ... Took me all about 1.5 hours to shift to this phone with Smart Switch ... And made in India too ...

-----
Pathetic product
-----
I purchased this mobile for my wife. Received the mobile on 7th March. It's been just a month and charger stopped working suddenly today. We are feeling  helpless as don't have any other similar charger to charge the mobile even don't have any backup phone as well. As it's lockdown situation and unable to seek any backup. Phone is switched off from today morning. Pathetic product from Samsung.

Average

Average quality camera isn't as expected phone is way heavy to handle compare to other phones over all ok ok

Good Phone for a Great Price
-----
Very impressive at the price.. battery is a beast. Quad cam at 64 MP is a steal. I'm an amateur photographer and though this might not be the best camera available around, I'm pretty satisfied  with the cameras.
-----
Good
-----
I  never thought Samsung gives the best of all in one phone,  camera and battery are the most attractive elements  of the phone. Atleast there is one brand you can blindly go for !
-----
Screen are not gorilla glass 3 protected.
-----
A good budget phone with monster battery but Samsung told they provide gorilla glass 3 protection on this phone display but my phone screen is damaged when I carry this in my pocket and I don't know how it is damaged but I'm very much sure they are not provide gorilla glass 3 protection, they are cheating with us and I want my money back very bad product on behalf of screen.
-----
Awesome quality
-----
After reading some bad reviews I was hesitating to buy this phone but I'm glad that I purchased M31 .phone is amazing camera quality is awesome n bettry life I haven't changed from last two days n still device bettry is 78% even after playing games like pub g n candy crush,, I don't regret buying this phone.thanks to the seller and Amazon for providing amazing phone in a budget price thank you I'm happyüôèüèªüôÇüôÇ
-----
Not the best but good
-----
Using mobile from last 10 days and i promised you that you'll be not disappointed by it. Battery backup is just awesome.  Can give you a full day backup with heavy usage like PUBg and youtube. But the only big con is slow charging
-----
Amazing phone!
-----
Amazing phone, especially considering the price point. The camera is great! And battery last atleast 1 n half days even with heavy usage.
-----
Best phone under 16k
-----
...very good phone ..display .camera ..speaker ..battery all are very good ...you have don't fill that the back side of phone is polycarbonate  it's look like glass.must buy..
-----
good , 7out of 10
-----
the rear 64 mp camera is good , but the micro can be better.
the Samsung  new processor  is so far so good
battery  life is so good.
although  phn has facial recognition which is so bad and can be improved.

Samsung M31- The allrouder one
-----
I like the Samsung M31. This is a very nice model that I ever seen. All the features are very nice. The most interesting feature is the camera quality and the 6000 mah battery.  And even the sound quality is also very good . Whenever I saw a movie I feel that that I am in the cinema hall. Because the display of the phone and the sound quality. I am very thankful of the Samsung company for this wonderful model.
-----
Excellent
-----
Best for this price...
Camera quality is not up to the mark...But still when comparing other phones in this price range its good...
Battery the real Monster...Can last easily to one and a half day or even two days...
Display excellent...
At times there is a heating issue...
Overall if you are searching for a phone with good display, battery and camera M31 is the best option you have...

-----
Totally in love with this phone
-----
This is a monster phone as the caption goes.. The kind of mobile usage I do, its very extensive, but still the battery runs for me a day and a half. Which is amazing... Camera is amazing the shots are so amazingly beautiful.. I'm attaching some pics I clicked with this phone... Totally a monstrous phone with a monstrous battery.... Totally in love with it..

1. camera is awesome
2. battery will give u full support for the day on full charge

and above all its samsung...ü§©üòç

True Monster (with best battery, performance &amp; Camera)
-----
I love this phone. The fingerprint reader works awesomely &amp; camera quality is just amazing which gives you different modes to click &amp; record the moment.
And the cherry on the cake is the battery life of this phone. After playing PUBG Mobile for more than a hour the battery drops down only around 12-15% &amp; the phone doesn't heat.
Great work by Samsung &amp; great delivery &amp; packaging services by Amazon.
-----
Exceptional phone at 16k
-----
Delivery -on time
Samsung M31 is nice phone with a great camera. Selfie camera lack a little bit crispness
Loved the wide angle lens photography. Phone work fluidly well and there is no lag in performance. Battery is amazing need a full charge after 2days. Just one negative thing is the back plastic panel can get scrached easily So I m satisfied with the phone.
-----
#smooth monster
-----
Unbelievable  from Samsung. The fast charging is good. Charges within  2 hours. Smooth experience in using. The quad camera design  is outstanding. It deserves  a 5 star. Thanks to Amazon free fast delivery.  I received the product in 26 hours after order.Personally calculated  charging speed 0.5percent to 0.6 percent per minute.approx 2hour 42min to 3hour 18 min for 0 to 100 percent on switch off charging.
-----
Not really good build quality for the money from Samsung
-----
Not satisfied , slow processor for daily use ....signal receiving is weak,sound quality is average ....ram is  occupied with not many apps ...only thing that is good is battery back .. even back is not upto the mark for 6000 mah capacity
-----
Must buy
-----
Beast under 16,000 Rs. Must go for it guys . And buy Spigen case for it ,that will give it protection + premium feel. I watched videos saying that it have bad feel in hand, but guys trust me the phone is solid and stylish. Display is awesome,  charging is very fast , battery is fantastic and overall you can play Pubg at highest graphics without any lag .
-----
Wonderful phone to give the Chinese brands a run for their money
-----
Using the phone for 3 days now and it's brilliant. The SAmoled screen makes colors pop, the camera is amazing in bright light with great features (slow-mo, focus etc) and app performance is econd to none. Only complaint I have is the performance of the camera in low light. Apart from that, I am throughly satisfied with the phone. 5 stars!!
-----
Risky buy!
-----
In 45 days, I am experiencing speaker and mic problems.  Both have stopped working even though I handled the phone very carefully.  I also have a Samsung S8 and it's working fine since  2017.  So, is there there quality issues only with M31?  I hope they replace the faulty phone.  My family also uses a Vivi V15 for 1 year but it never gave problem like this Samsung M31.

Absolutely worth it just face unlocking is slow
-----
Wonderful cellphone worth premium looks and obviously monstrous  battery life, camera quality is good but face unlocking is a bit slow infact not working properly. Cons I found in this cell phone is that some times it stops working (hanging problem like each and every Samsung cell phone) and face unlocking is very slow but overall a good phone in  this range. I suggest to go for it as overall its worth it
-----
Samsung m31
-----
M31 nice mobile,looks good.stylish and camera is up to mark. Good features. Before buying I enquired with Samsung customer service through Amazon chatting. Regarding inbuilt call recording facility. And executive confirmed inbuilt call recording is there with this mobile, but this feature is not available with this mobile. That's the only disappointing.
-----
very bad product
-----
It doesn't even deserve one star..Its just a month back I have purchased this phone..Now its not working..not even turning on...very much disappointed..
@Amazon team,please let me know what is procedure to claim warranty..Anyway  no option to return now.
-----
Real monster....go for it
-----
Real monster in this price range....superb camera quality, no ,one can beat this phone in this segment,huge battery back up, no lagging ,6 GB ram  runs very smooth.Just go for it.
-----
Do not purchase from Amazone
-----
In this phone I faced many issues like overheating, hanging,  app download problem from play store, problem during calling also.
Camera is average.
Battery life is not like 6000mah.

Biggest reason I don't like and not recognize purchase from Amazon is they not replaced or refund my money when I complained before 17th March 2020. I'm still waiting for refund that not done till date.
-----
Budget phone and a monster in terms of battery and other specs.
-----
A perfect budget smartphone. Trust on samsung. Awesome display, speakers are loud and clear enough.
Nice camera in this budget. Its a battery monster powered by 6000 mah battery. Light weight...weight distribution is very nicely done. A 6GB variant at this price range is a nice deal with this package.
As per my usage it's a good deal for me.
-----
A Battery heavyweight.
-----
M31 is better from its predecessor M30 with bigger battery life and camera quality. Finger print reader is much faster. Snappy colors which come beautifully on screen.  Not much heavy and looks are stylish.
-----
Nice phone in the price range.
-----
Overall it's a good phone in the price.
Camera is a plus for this phone. Amazing pictures even in low light.
Screen resolution and colors are really true and gives you an experience.
Battery I see is draining quite early given the huge size it's still a minus point for samsung.
Speed and usability is nice for gamers.
-----
Awsome camera, battery backup, screen. Love this phone of samsung
-----
Awsome mobile by SAMSUNG with so many feature's inbuilt in a reasonable price.
Camara quality is very good.
Working smoothly,
Battery backup at it's best....
Screen touch is buttery.... very good
Front camera 32 MP quality love the most...
Over all full power pack package,  just go for it.....
-----
Above Average phone
-----
Pros:
1. sAMOLED display is excellent
2. Good battery back
3. Rear Camera is awesome with all sorts of  options

Cons:
1. Front Camera is not very great, fully depended on Software, hopefully the upcoming upgrades will fix the issues
2. Sound quality &amp; volume on loudspeakers could've been better

Will edit the review after continous usage.

Good
-----
I am using this phone since march,so far i am satisfied with the camera,sound and display,but the cons is this phone does not come with earphone,phone cover,and i cannot find any cover for this phone ib local market ,i tried to purchase it from online and lockdown happen,and the charging time is around 3 hours
-----
Not Best
-----
64 MP+32 MP Camera of M31 as 13 MP back camera+front as 8 mp camera as my old 2015 model j7 duos mobile.not better.Processor also not fast.Price must be worth of RS.12000.Display is good.
-----
Touch is very worst and not at all responding
-----
I ordered this mobile the day samsumg launched, got it on 6th, after using 14days, the performance of screen is verybad and not able to operate
Pros
No pros

Cons
touch screen is like very worst and its functioning its own.
trying to switch off but it is not allowing me to type even numbers
overall its waste of money
trying to give return and no option to return
-----
Amazing phone at an even more amazing price!
-----
Overall an excellent phone by Samsung. What surprised me was the battery backup. Even though I play Call of Duty for about 2-3 hours a day, I can go more than 24 hours without charging. The camera is excellent too. The Samsung Galaxy M31 is the best phone I have used till date. Infact it is way better than phones segments above it. Close youe eyes and buy this one. Good job Samsung!
-----
Enjoy the budget mobile with all excellent features
-----
Come up with excellent features, 64 inches screen, primary camera quality 62mp, front camera 32 mp, with super study mode it gives excellent experience for super stable footage and Ram 6GB with internal memory and most imp battery with fast charging, Finger print censor is quick, hearing  Dolby sound with head sets is great experience. With these all features come under your budget.
-----
Good phone
-----
This phone is very good when it comes to display, battery &amp; performance for daily usage. Back camera is fine, front camera not much good. Gaming I have not played any heavy games. One good thing is with 6000mah battery it doesn't heat too much except charging time. Overall I could say this phone is worth for this price range. Only drawback is 15W charger. Takes more time to charge..
-----
Camra is osm and battery makeup is 24 hours
-----
Very best and I like much best battery one time charge to 24 backup and best feature is camra is osm camra very best quality photo with64 map camra and best feature is quad camra setup is very best and very helpful fegarprint reader is best unlock is very fast best money product mid rang prise is best phone I tell you can bought phone thanks for reading my review very help fully you
-----
Gorgeous mobile phone
-----
I love Samsung m31 all features it is the best phone with all latest features with low price. I cannot compete it with other mobiles.
Very best phones for technological people.
Best fingerprint sensor
Best processor
Best camera
Best battery life
And all best features.
I recommended to buy samsung m31 , for those who searching for mobiles below the price of 20,000 ..
-----
Awesome phone within mid range segment
-----
Awesome phone with wonderful features in this price. Cant expect more. Be it camera quality, sleek design with amazing look, handy grip, battery backup, picture quality or the big internal storage. M31 excels in every field. Sound alongwith great picture quality is like experiencing a theatre setup. I am loving it. Amazing product. Loved it. Full marks for Samsung.
-----
If u need a mobile for good pics..Then u can blindly go for M31..
-----
Good in Camera,  Fingerprint , display &amp; battery life. Especially camera is very good. You might not need a DSLR if you have M31 in ur hand.

Not sure if fast charging is enabled. It takes nearly 4hrs to reach 100%. May be it is because of 6000mah..

Mobile handling should be carefully as the outfit is very smooth and slips from hand very easily

Balanced Review.
-----
This is really megaMonster. Review after 3 days of use. Battery is awesome. Camera has all the things to be passionate to capture. U'll fall in love with Display quality.
Very good for all, especially for students. Blue colour is not much attractive as shown in the pic.
Will update further after some days.
Pics uploaded- Selfie, Macro and Rear camera.
-----
Pathetic performance cam
-----
Camera of this mobile is very pathetic to be exact . It's not having that much image quality, focus is very bad. Only suitable for normal use . The only pro I found in the phone I found is the Amoled display, which is remarkable . Camera quality of honor mobile are more good when  compared with m31 . The Manuel mode or the Pro mode of the m31 is pathetic . Frame rate and image quality ratio is pathetic
-----
Awesome phone at great price!
-----
Fingerprint reader is quick. Camera quality is awesome for this range. Battery lasts 2 days with dual sim,multiple apps running, moderate internet and phone usage.
-----
A perfect one
-----
Perfect night clicks with this cam and the clicks on greens are awesome too. Battery life is for two complete days if you are not a gaming freek. This is the one that I was looking for with a perfect cam and processor speed that could hold well all the apps installed. Liking the quality of the pics withthis phone, one of my friends got it too. Great phone overall.
-----
Awesome by brand and convenient by price.
-----
After a long time Samsung took this opportunity to realease a excellent device in budget rate. Device stands strong on there specifications and quality. This is the first time I bought a samsung device and I think I'll continue with my preferences with this brand in future also. Thanks Samsung :)
-----
Samsung at it's best - M series which gives the feel of S series
-----
Best smartphone in the mid segment. This is equipped with awesome camera with multiple features, best in class battery which can last an apocalypse!! (I seriously mean it). Also, its fingerprint sensor is so quick and its response time is very impressive.
I am totally happy with this phone. Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞
P.S. Just to add - I am looking forward to missing earphones along with the phone. üòâüòâ
-----
Very poor front camera
-----
Very poor front camera.... In day light it works good but in low light its works very bad and back camera performance is good.... Overall display is very fine but speaker sound is little bit low... It takes 2hours 38min to full charge. Its too long to full charging as it provide 18w or 20w fast charger will decrease charging time but they providing 15w charger, I was very disappointed in that fact.
-----
More than best in such price range super loaded with features
-----
Oh god This phone is literally a mega monster
With its super amoled display its always great to stream anything love the colours.
And then comes the camera slow motion super slow motion and the options goes on and on and even 4k recording on front camera
And further comes the battery which is extremely powerful i can literally stream or play games for hours without worrying about it.
-----
Budget phone
-----
Budget phone with budget features..6000 mah battery is just fake...its same performance as other android phones..one day from morning to night it lasts with minimal usage....front camera is not so good...just selfies like in any old phones is obtained....back camera is good...rest itna paisa me jyada hi Mila.. go for it
-----
One of the perfect launch...
-----
After all Samsung is Samsung, the name itself gives definition of power and durability. And to prove this M31 is the best example that you will find.

I am not going to define it in pros and cons becoz that is not necessary since there is no cons at all. Perfect package in such a reasonable price. RAM, CAMERA, OS everything is perfect. PLS PLS GO FOR IT

Kudos to the wight balancing
-----
The fingerprint reader is effectively faster than the previous M-Series phone launched by Samsung. The camera quality, I would say is far better than what I had expected it to be. And the battery comes with a well curated backup of 6000mAh. It charges a little low considering other competitive fast charging phones, but other than that it's a well balanced device.
-----
Bad product received. Certainly will not recommend
-----
After 1 day of receiving, device is getting heated up after 5 minutes of usage. Can't hold the phone near ears for calling . It is completely heated up. Tried calling the service centre, they tell that heating issues is not at all a issue. We can't help with that. Completely disappointed.  Did not expect this from Samsung and very bad customer service from amazon
-----
Best in class and design
-----
Best in class, a masterpiece created by Samsung India, i purchased  it few days back and I am impressed with the quality of the product they have delivered this time within the limited price range all the features are very attractive and absolutely gives you exclusive feel in this price range go for it you will feel satisfied. Highly recommendedüòä
-----
Not good
-----
I think I did a huge mistake in choosing this product rather than Redmi.
Issues with this phone within 7 days of purchase -
1. Keypad hangs in between and nothing helps and I have to reboot.
2. I lock it by smart lock and the next thing I know the phone is unlocked with a swipe.
3. The worst part is I contacted amazon and they ran a check and nothing was found.
-----
Must buy phone for this budget. Worth for money
-----
Using it for around 5 days. Very good phone, battery backup upto 2 days camera quality is ver good, high-quality display. Not much weight feeling for a 6000mAh battery. Volume is also good. Not much pre installed aps. Good hi provided by samsung. Touch sensitivity can be adjusted as per user requirement. So far I am happy with this product. Timely delivery by Amazon team as well
-----
Camera, battery &amp; performance
-----
Best mobile for daily usage, fingerprint speed is much better, camera quality is awesome Image stabilisation good  in 4k recording, picture quality &amp; image details will be excellent, it takes 3 hours to get fully charged, but battery life will be really great. Weight of the mobile is not much higher while compared to the battery capacity, speaker sound quality is loud, overall performance is good
-----
Best mobile with trusted brand
-----
I write this review after 20 days of use samsung m31 (6+128)
Fingerprint sensor is very fast
Camera is also good
Slow motion recording is nice
Speaker is best than any other mobile
Good loud speaker
Super amoled display is very nice
Battery is awwwwwwsooomeeeee
Verrrrrrryy veeerryyy long life
2 sim + 1 memory card
All over best smartphone in this range
-----
M31 - an ideal device for high use kind of user
-----
Flawless fingerprint reader - rightly placed behind to have easy access at the same time not blocking any other screen space when phone is in use.
Camera - satisfied with the captures till now. One of the best stability for a point and shoot device.
Battery - USP of m31. 6000mAH helping me not to worry about charger even once during entire day. Moderately high use due to nature of work.
-----
Samsung M31 - One of the best phone available under 20000
-----
Amazing phone with excellent picture quality and longest battery  life.
Both front and rear cameras are very good. There are lots of option given in the phone camera to capture your best moments. Slo mo and pro mode are good.
Features like taking screen print with hand gesture are excellent.
This is one of the best phone available with lots of new feature at very affordable price.

Battery &amp; Camera

Hi All,
I am using this mobile since 6th March 2020.
* Since i am working in marketing domain, Internet / WIFI will be turned on (non-continous) in mobile atleast 16 hours and calls around 30 - 35 calls / day.  My mobile will get "discharged within 1 day" against specified 48 hours so i am rating 3 out of 5.
* The snaps captured is of good quality so i rated 5 out of 5 for Camera.

Mindblowing
-----
The finger-print is swift and unlocks the phone in a blink of an eye. The Camera is fabulous. The wide angle camera includes alot in just a frame. The macro-shot camera gives you a real life photography experience. The front camera is fantastic and enhances beauty and gives out smart clicks especially with portrait mode. The battery life is very good and drags the power to last upto 2-2.5 days.

gets hangedand heated
-----
i broutht these phone a month back. the phone gets heated and hangs automaticlly. twice phone got switched off as i got a call and phone got switched off. not really happy with the phone. due to lockdown was unable to review as was away from office and could not review because had ordered through office.
  if possible change with another model of samsung.
-----
Excellent amazing marvelous
-----
Battery life amazing camera quality excellent super amoled display given excellent feel when I touch display and mobile speaker very good using headphone Dolby atmos sound quality is very very excellent. This all the future given other brands they fix it on the price above 25 k but here just 16000 only. My great salute to you Samsung thank you so much for given in this mobile.
-----
Not for good buy....
-----
I have 6-128 samsung m31 but very slow, power button take at least 1 or above second to lock or unlock...
Processing speed üëéüëé
Camera üëéüëé
Battery performance not upto mark recently I used Asus max pro m1 that have 5000 mah battery and honestly  5000 mah battery is much better then this Samsung m31 6000 mah battery..
-----
Fake 6000mah battery m31, hang while playing heavy game
-----
Everything ok but battery 6000 it's fake due to I have redmi note8 which battery is 4000mah after using both phones full day both mobiles are same %of battery
Both mobiles using YouTube but battery same % so I think battery is fake in Samsung m31
Now when I was play bus simulator game mobile is getting hang not operate the game proper
-----
Battery drain and overheating near camera
-----
The battery lasted 8 hours after a full charge with mediocre usage. The phone got really hot near the camera. Camera quality is fine when provided with enough lighting but low light shots were awful. This speaks volumes about the quality control of these phones. Samsung is out here scamming the mid tier market. If I don't get a proper replacement I'm going to court with this.
-----
Defective piece delivered
-----
Brought a M31 through Amazon and delivered on time. But the phone set is defective. Call voice is disappearing for few seconds and coming back and it is repeating during call. Spoken to many Amazon customer executives but no solution given yet. Even they cant hear voice from this phone so calling to my another phone. Demanded replace but nothing done yet. I want replace that it...no more craps
-----
Very Nice Smartphone üí¶
-----
This is a very nice smart phone in this price range.  The cameras are very nice and gives a perfect shot. You all know i have multiple daddies..so those who are interested to become one of my daddies. Dm me..and check my availability and get a token because there will be a long Que...So be alert and enjoy.....Battery backup is superb
-----
Amazing Performance.
-----
Samsung always stands it way.
Very much impressed with M31 6GB/128 GB variant.
Camera founds very awesome and sAMOLED display seduce  the user to use it again and again.
Battery lasts more than 2 days with random usage and more than a day with continuous use.
Love this phone..Hats off to samsung for making me feel worth it.
-----
All that I wanted my phone to have, M31 has it all!
-----
This phone is just the complete package I was looking for!
Camera... is just superb with awesome pic quality and variety of lenses
Storage is great for a person like me who loves keeping memories saved
The best is the battery life, one single charge works for 24 hrs with constant usage of internet, music, camera and calls.
M just loving it to the core..!‚ù§

Smooth PUBG without lag on medium graphics

Comes with great features but lack in camera

The fingerprint reader is quick and perfect. The hardware is good and unlocks with a nominal click
As of camera, the expectations are high but not delivered, quad cam is not helping much
Battery life is good, heavy games are not draining the battery a lot just like the one plus series phones
Looks of phone is good and curved screen and new functionality of android 10 is a plus

Excellent phone without expensive deal

This is my 3rd samsung  mobile. I just pick 3 main point of m31
First point Battery,  almost using more than 1 and half day .
2nd point Ram management, app opens very fast as well not hogging or lagging at any moment.
3rd Display, super amoled Display value addition  in all over rating .

Camera should be improved from software end .

I am an iPhone user... I wanted to buy a phone for longer batter backup.. I did lot of R&amp;D and found out this. I waited for this phone for 2 weeks and happy to have it. I am loving it .. Good Camera, Long battery backup and fast charging. Good resolution. I am loving it.
-----
We should crosscheck all specifications before purchase it.
-----
I purchased this phone to to enjoy my passion of singing on Starmaker App which is very best app for singing purpose,But unfortunately in this phone its mike is giving too much noise and voice distortion.As I am already having one Samsung M20 phone with me and purchased this phone especially only for singing purpose and if it not going to fullfill my passion ,I definitely return this phone.

Mega monster makes for mega dreams

Overall good phone
-----
Nice phone, good build quality and nice camera. Pics are really crisp. Have not yet tested night/low light photos. In my use of 3days battery has lasted for full day with mixed use of videos(6-7) hours games(2-3) and browsing
One con though that while playing heavy games(PUBG/COD) phone is hanging at times. Yes even new phone is hanging and it takes time to close the apps and restart.
-----
Wastage....
-----
Camera is not up to the mark... front cam captures very poor pictures.. and also gaming graphics are very poor... i am not at all happy with this purchasedüòëüòë very much disappointed by samsung .... guys don't buy this phone...
-----
Good
-----
I'm writing this review after using the phone for 2 weeks. Really happy with the phone. Battery lasting for a longer period, I had to charge only once in 2 days. Camera quality is good but not exceptionally good. I would have given a 5 star, but the headphones with the mobile was not that great. And gorilla glass and good back cover was not easily available for the phone.
-----
Great phone
-----
Amazing phone overall. Battery lasts for an entire day with heavy usage. It only needs to be charged once in a day for heavy usage or once in 2 days for average usage. The cameras are way better than expected. The display is vibrant. Great pricing too. I found it to be the best among all phones of this range and even ones that are slightly more expensive.
-----
Worth every penny!!
-----
The Mega Monster it is!!! It is really fast, the camera is absolutely amazing both front and rear!!
The body feels like it is made of glass, insane front display, best experience ever!!
The battery backup is also good, lacks a few things that other samsung devices had but its okay!
In the end, it's an amazing phone at this price!!!
Worth it, loved it!
-----
Outstanding!
-----
Highly recommendable phone with such perfect specs. Camera quality and battery is just par-excellence. Being Samsung it offers so many superb features in accessibility. Worth the price. Just the back-cover is very glossy lest this phone has no cons. Highly impressed by the camera quality, I've clicked some pictures in my recent domestic trip by this phone, you can see them in the attachment.
-----
Value for money..
-----
pros-
do i need to tell?!
cons-
1. some apps like facebook are system apps you cant uninstall
2. battery seems to drain fast in beginning then i turned it to power saver mode, now works fine for me.
3. camera gives you amazing photos in daylight, in night not good performance
-----
Smart Purchase - Value for money
-----
Phone looks really good and sleek design very impressive with latest android makes classic.
Camera quality is awesome.
Nothing to say about battery when 6000mAH provided where no other brand can beat which is class.
For normal operations it withstands for 3 days in solid manner whereas for heavy usage 1.5 to 2 days.
Processor and Memory are sufficient to do the trick.
-----
Mobile with a limited performance for the limited price we pay.
-----
This mobile has an amazing screen even direct sunlight and the camera performance is good . but it does has its negatives like lagging sometimes and hangs suddenly out of no where.... but then when it does work it does ultimate job ....
the fingerprint doesnt respond properly.
Overall i would say its amazing as an mid budget phone but ok if u r thinking of a great performance.,
-----
I will give it 4 star for fulfilling its features which is given in advertisements.
-----
Security like app lock is absent which is a necessary requirement today.
One can easily see yr msgs details in notification panel bcoz in setting ,very less option available  ,
Actually i bought it based on what the product was conveying though its advertising but  my requirement was less as i mentioned above,and not fulfilled.

In rest of matters  phone is very good.
-----

-----
Indeed a MEGA MONSTER and a budget phone of the year !
-----
What i like the most about this phone is the battery life and its design but i am a but disappointed with the camera quality and its processor.It lacks speed and smoothness in multitasking and various operations.I hope that everything will be fixed with new software  update and my review  will be appreciated.Its fingerprint and face lock can be made faster.
Thanks.
-----
Good mobile
-----
recently bought the mobile phone.  look is very good, camera is awesome but as the Samsung is famous for hanging, I noticed it restarted on its own while using two three times since last i bought it  10 days back. If the memory ROM will be full in next few moth I think it wont be able to handle it and hanging and restarting will increase.
-----
Worthy buy for the amount paid!! Supports both Jio and other network sim at the same time.
-----
It has everything that I expected. Battery lasts for 2 days with normal use, listening to music for couple of hours a day including watching a whole movie on prime.
-----
Superb smatphoneüëåüèº
-----
Everything about this phone is very good. From its design to its camera, all the features are awesome. Not to forget its 6000mAh battery &amp; sAMOLED display which again is very good. To my surprise the fingerprint sensor and face unlock is very fast. I didn't gave full 5‚≠ê because we can't use flash while clicking photos using 64 MP camera &amp; front camera is 21 MP and not 32.
-----
Samsung M31..
-----
The packing was not upto the mark. Inside the Samsung pack the phone was very loosely positioned. The outer pack of the Original Samsung packet was not seen as if somebody had already opened the pack..
-----
Samsung M31 - Perfect in all aspects.
-----
I ordered M31 on Mar 5 and as promised by Amazon got it on Mar7.

About M31- (out of 5)
Battery - 5
RAM and ROM - 5
Screen - 5
Camera - 4.5
Speakers - 5

Battery charging (While on charging it got 21% in half an hour) and in 2.5 hrs full charged.

It's almost more than 24 hrs and still 30% battery remaining.

Android - 10
-----
Thank you Samsung
-----
Samsung Galaxy m31 is the best mobile in that price range I have used it for a week and It gave me the best performance. So this mobile will give a good competition to other mobiles in that price range
I appreciate samsung to give the best mobile for that price range
Every aspect in the mobile is good
Every specification which is given to us by Samsung is value for money
-----
GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH SAMSUNG PHONE
-----
Its really a megamonster.
-----
All features r satisfying...and one thing i like most is battery backup...when it comes to battery backup no other phone can beat it.it is really a megamonster. Once i charged it to 100% ...it was surprising to see again 100% after watching a full Netflix episode.that was amazing. And further after a pubg match i found it on 96%. So u can assume how's the performance.
-----
M writing it after 3 weeks and being very honest
-----
Its the best.its battery life is great . I sort of dislike the camera since m able to see my wrinklesü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£. Damm m a gamer.the pubg experience is smooth .the video quality in metflix is also fine .ita best in this price go for it. Nice really nice .quite satified.
-----

-----
Impressive
-----
Fingerprint sensors we're very fast compared to Other mobiles.
Cameras were also superb...I thought front camera could be dull but...after Reviewing it...it was superb.
The Battery Life is like really a monster.
Once I'm getting one day Life with one time charged.
Games were also Very Good to play...
Finally A Best Product under little budget.
-----
Worst battery. Takes forever to charge it.
-----
One of the worst battery life. Takes more than 4 hours to charge. Get discharge in one day. If you use more feature then even less. And almost all the features which looks so big on paper are quite avg in use.

I regret buying this product.

Amazon, please let this review pass your filter. Few of my negative reviews are not public.
-----
Ok Mobile not the perfect like A series .
-----
It is a OK types Mobile, heavy due to 6000 mah battery . Battery life is around one and half day .  Do not compare this phone with any A series phone A series far better.
Samsung should have included NCF feature in this phone . Sometime it automatically get swith off.
Who looking for budget phone with Android 10  this phone can be a choice .
-----
Heating problem
-----
Phone has got lot of heating problem. You can not talk on the phone without earphones because you can't hold your phone near your ears. Samsung has to take this into consideration.
-----
Completely satisfied
-----
Samsung m31 is probably the best mobile in its price range, beside of it having the best display like any other other Samsung smartphone, samsung m31 has a unbelievable  camera and a good battery backup with its sleek and sexy design and a beast processor it wins competition with its competitors of same price range i am 100% satisfied with the product and will recommend it to anybody
-----
Best in the World...
-----
It deserves more than 10 starts. it's just awesome...Camera ,battery , Processor everything's unbeatable for sure now, If it's in you're budget just go for it, It won't Disappointed you ever . N Display is tooooo much good with Super Amoled Display, !

Just compare its Black colour with any smartphone and you will be shocked,

tip: Handle Carefully, its delicate.
-----
Likes and dislikes
-----
Let me start with what I dislike
1. The phone is really bulky
2. There is not much grip in the phone so i am always scared i might drop it(Can be resolved with a grip cover)
Goods
Flash photography is good
Tried macro that was good too
Night mode better than before
Battery life is good (fast charging)
Finally the display is the best part of it
-----
Auto Restarts while using
-----
Everything is good about this phone but only thing that disappoints is that it is restarting automatically while using.
-----
Good storage and not bad battery n camera
-----
64MP Camera which doesn't have good quality images and shaky images often. Battery back up is not bad. Processor performance is not good getting hang quite often. Still there is no update released to improve its performance. Cost is 17K and the worth to cost is ok.
-----
Wondered in use of 2 days.
-----
I'm the big fan of Samsung and this item(Galaxy m31) was fully satisfied me. The Fingerprint Scanner was totally Awesome,It was unlocking very speed. The Camera was Extraordinary but has lot of Noise in image at Low light area. But the Battery does Not satisfied me, It not work like 6000 MAh but now very bad. Finaly it was Totally Worth for 15/16 K.
-----

good phone but not best
-----
camera quality is poor in comparison to other brands like vivo. oppo or realme. processor is of low quality therefore there is  little hanging problem. battary is good but not as 6000mah but same as 4500mah. so finally ,,, go with other brands.
-----
Megamonster with Mega Picture
-----
Best smartphone in the price range of 16000, quad camera with  64 MP, wide angle and good aperture provides excellent pictures. Fingerprint reader given on back panel and working very well. Super Amoled display provides a cool touch performance. Most important is its Mega battery of 6000 mAH which lasts up to 2 days with normal internetuse, after full charging. Excellent smartphone.
-----
Unbearable Heat like ‡Æï‡Øä‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ÆÆ‡Øç
-----
My nearly 20 days use...
Very fisrt review
"Battery is just like a 3800 MAH drains so fastly while charging I felt like touching a boiling water utensil so hot"

"Camera not bad but I felt like around 40 mp rear and 8mp front"

"Heat issue is on top front and back"

So am totally disappointed..
-----
Works efficiently as its name "MONSTER".
-----
I'm glad to inform you that Samsung M31 is much more efficient than my expectations.in this price or in this segment everyone as specially middle class people can afford this wonderful phone. The main 2 features fascinates me which are long bettery life and various precious camera modes. I'm thankful to Samsung to make this piece for us. And I would love to use this phone üòÉüòÉüòòüòò
-----
Awesome mobile and justify the price.
-----
Used phone for 3 days and I am having great experience, performance is just awesome while plyaing games very smooth and battery is really giant, you can simply passed a day once fully charged and it reached 0to 54 % in 1 hour, loving the camera and specially the picks taken at night. Video experience is great with such big screen, fingerprint and face recognition featurs are good.
-----
Not good to buy sansung
-----
I find Hanging problem in this phone may be cancelled this order too
In some application it hanging make me crazy to return
Otherwise it's ok
After long time I buy samsung product just because of the same problem
I think others phone is better than samsung for high price and low quality
-----
Do not buy this product.
-----
Guys do not buy this phone. Its absolutley rubbish.  Its hangs like anything. If you simultaneously open 4 apps its will restart automatically.  Do not buy this. Absolute waste of money.
-----
A MegaMonster

The amazing thing about this phone is the battery backup , really a mega monster device .This smartphone looks even graceful when click pictures through it camera .

-----
Initial experience is good
-----
Initial experience is good.Battery discharge is quick even after closing background applications and services.Camera quality is good. Touch sensitivity could be improved as I face issue while accepting incoming call(Touch sensitivity option is enabled).Fingerprint is responsive, not used the face recognition yet.No lagging found and overall performance is good.
-----
Specs and review
-----
One of the best phone ever seen.. The battery lasts for nearly one and a half day.. As the name suggest it is a mega monster... I suggest people that they could buy this phone... Camera is the best according to me... The speed of the fingerprint sensor is fast... It also has Face detector which is as quick as lightning and is very accurate...
This phone is just awesome....
-----
Good phone at this budget
-----
After using using Galaxy M31 for about 15 days that I'm very much satisfied with this product. I've got the 64 GB variant. It's working pretty well. Although the back Panel of this device catch scratches very easily, also the cable provided with this phone is a bit short, but still at this price range this is the best phone with all the desired specifications, that one can get.
-----
Worst Samsung phone and Service
-----
Worst phone from Samsung after only 3 months of use its touch is not working properly and support team is saying due to lockdown we can't do anything. Worst phone with worst Samsung service after lock down get over I will throw it and I will not buy any phone from samsung in future and also not recommend anyone to buy. Amazon service was good got delivered before Estimate time.
-----
Best phone to buy if you want a good experience
-----
Best smartphone by samsung with 6000mah Monster battery best gaming experience with having exynos9611 which provide less lags to gamer and give best gaming graphics and super amoled screen give wonderful colors and 64 mp camera gives lovely photosbut samsung should include a 20 watt super fast charger in this kind of featured phone i think it is a good chocice to buy this phone
-----
Brilliant phone
-----
Fantastic love it every feature is amazing and for a good price battery life is excellent camera is super display is brilliant and lots of storage no bloatware.
-----
Smooth, crisp and fully of battery!
-----
One of the best phone I have ever used in under 20K category.  I couldn't find a single con to mention, frankly speaking I was not expecting that much of life from Samsung in this price range ..... Everything is perfect and a must buy for anyone who is exploring a phone!
-----
Phone review
-----
It's been a while since I have started using this mobile. The back camera is marvelous  however front camera needs  more improvements particularly  in low light. It would have been better if flashlight  in front also would have been there.
However  the battery  life is monster and is superb for gaming purpose.
It's a win win situation  for anybody having this mobile.
-----
Always worst mobile from samsung
-----
One star bcoz 5 march 2020 buy this mobile and now mobile heating and auto restart without any option,,, why having the problem in samsung m31 6gb 128 rom.
After all camera good almost battery also but problem in heating and restart without gaming,,, phone using for calls and internet.
Finally in the segment worst mobile in the world.

Camera quality and battery life is really good ..... Phone never hangs I have been using it for the past two weeks now and I didn't find any trouble yet .... Gaming performance is also good considering its a midrange phone ..... If you want to buy a phone under 20k then this is it.

Samsung m31s review
-----
Mobile get stuck while typing and back to normal after lock and unlock screen. No option for blocking of troublesome SMS alerts. Brightness enhancing issues with the camera. Barely match camera features with ads. Cooling system is very poor. Apart from these speed and performance is awesome.
-----
Poor Quality specs
-----
Finger print reader sucks, very poor quality also the phone has lot of issues with charging, if it happens to discharge completely then it dosen't turn on easily,..also it's getting stuck many times,disappointed,,with Samsung rather's than this phone. I understood that either we should go for high end samsung or go for other brands such as real me or anything for that matter.
-----
Good product, Camera is good felt value for the money
-----
Bought this phone in launch and initial impression felt value for the money with samsung brand.
Pros
1) screen refresh rate
2) camera
3) battery
4) sleek model
cons
1) for a 6000mah monster battery they should provide reasonable fast charger, the charger they have provided will take 3 times more time when i charged with my 15w vooc charger.
-----
The Jack - of - all - trades phone.
-----
The Jack - of - all - trades phone. This phone has fulfilled my needs which I wanted. The phone is like big treasure in small chest because in a price as low as this I got 128 GB enormous storage with powerpuff 6GB RAM. And the monster camera what to say about. And that 6000 maH battery resolved my problem of frequent charging. That's all I needed. Thank you
-----
Best mobile for 16k
-----
Best phone for 16k and camera was good 64 mega  pixel extraordinary  working and battery back up was good I was already received the phone through  Amazon since last 10days back 2days battery backup and pic was given by all front and back cameras awesome. Overall phone is awesome. And also ram and processor also good working...
-----
Worth for the money.
-----
Mobile is worth for money. Liked the camera most. Using the mobile since a week. Performance is good and battery is awesome which lasts me for 2 days on a single charge. Since it has a plastic body providing a protective backcover, screen protector will be a added advantage from the company As I couldn't find any protective accessories for my mobile in the market or online.
-----
Best budget package
-----
Good enough speed whil finger print reading and camera quality is awesome but need software enhancements as texture getting smooth in some scenarios. And about battery its great easily get for a typical user but I personally think that it need some enhancements on software side as I use xiaomi mobile previously it has 4500 mah battery . Both performances looking so similar.

Good Mobile at a affordable price,worth buying.
-----
Nice mobile and as advertised the camera features are good.
Speed is also good and the feedback is also pretty fast.
Some of the unecessary default apps have been removed and OneUI 2.0 also has some new interesting features.
-----
Worth to buy
-----
M31 is an excellent camera phone with four rear and one front camera. Picture quality and video quality are owsome. It gives fair battery back up. The phone is very stable during screen casting. Little heavy.but ok
-----
Samsung Galaxy M31 is the Monster phone you need!
-----
Amazing phone, has all the necessary features and more! Battery life is insane! Monster 6 GB RAM supports all of my favorite games! Sharp and precise Camera, amazing with the night mode and macro mode! Super fast fingerprint reader! I would recommend this to anybody looking for a phone that suits your budget with the best features! Samsung Galaxy M31 is the phone you need!
-----
Worth every penny
-----
I would recommend this phone any day if gaming is not your priority.

Amazing screen
Impressive battery life
Great fingerprint scanner (Coming from Galaxy S10)
Good camera setup (Would've been great if there was a telephoto and not a useless macro lens)
Good build quality (Doesn't feel cheap as M30s)
-----
Love the phone features but having issues.
-----
I love the features of the phone, camera, battery life, storage, processor. The only reason for one star is the phone delivered to me on 12 this month and I am having sound issues while playing media some times. It is pity if a 14 days old phone needs to visit service center.
This phone is also restarting automatically many times a day. What is wrong with the product.
-----
Solid choice
-----
Solid phone at the price point.

Everything is about as good as you can get at this price of not better (the battery for example).

As long as you aren't looking for ultra-high settings based gaming, this is more than enough for day to days with enough oomph for everything in between.

If you're working on a budget, go for it.
-----
Very good phone
-----
It is really  good phone at this price. You don't need to charge the phone at least for a day because  it has  6000 MAH battery. It has good camera quality  too.
-----
Best mobile i ever used compared to all brands in this price range
-----
1. Good battery life ,on heavy use it lasts for 24 hrs and more,
2. I switched from One plus to Samsung I feel Samsung is much more better in UI
3.camera at its  best for the price tag
4. As smooth as butter,as fast as Flagship phone itself
5. Blindly Go for this Samsung M31, u will not regret
-----
It is overall a Quite good smartphone.
-----
Cons- The body is plastic,so I don't like it. Camera is not thatbgood as compared to other products. It doesn't show internet connection speed. It auto downloads a lot of unwanted apps. Internet Speed is slow. The back starts heating while downloading large files or playing games. Battery drains fast
-----
Go for it if gaming isn't a priority
-----
Really good phone for this price range.
I would recommend this for thise who highly depend on battery and they don't  game a lot.
Major usage of this device is content consumption. Although  gaming can also be done smoothly but wouldn't  recommend heavy gaming of several hours. Battery lasts fir al long time. Charges fairly quick. Overall a phone worth the hype.

Ear phone not incuded
-----
Ear phone not included, normally it has to be...USB cable head not appropriate to hold the mobile while charging..seems to be a duplicate product by the seller..I'm not happy with the seller. So only 3 star.
-----
Best buy in this cost segment
-----
Most like things first
1. Camera is super - for both front and rear You can shot quality image and it is worth of it.
2. Battery life as given 6000 mAh -- Almost support one complete day with heavy use.
3. Super Amold touch-- you can feel it.
4. Super fast with multi app usage.

Now I can say I'm completely satisfied with this phone results.
-----
Mobile Getting Hanged frequently
-----
3 weeks back i bought this Phone, it is asking for software update, Mobile getting Hanged. Also when ever restarting the mobile asking for Password, It is very tough to enter password since screen is not responding. I Don't recommend to buy this product. Now Service center or not there. Don't know what to do with this phone.
-----
Best Choice under Budget!!!!
-----
I have been using Samsung's M51 phone from 6th Mar so far so good.

Pros:
Battery life is excellent
Fast Internet surfing
Great performance
Good photo quality in daylight
Attractive AMOLED display
Finger print/Face unlock feature

Cons:

Audio- Single speaker
Spammy notifications
Poor video stabilisation
-----
Good mobile
-----
In my point of view, Samsung Galaxy m31's overall performance is so good when compared to my previous experience with other cell phones. With moderate weight, this looks so amazing.  The blue light filter is
genuinely beneficial in avoiding eye irritation. The 6000 mAh battery gives a pleasant usage life of around 2 days.
The camera is very good at efficiency.
-----
Very very poor show of samsung
-----
Very poor show in all respect having fake 64 megapixel Niether having camera quality nor processor. After ten days its start hanging problem and now i got problem in playin videos making voice and video call speaker is not working. Very worst experience with samsung i never bought samsung in future. And now i m without phone in this covid -19 situation i hv no operation
-----

Sheer disappointment from Samsung
-----
Felt cheated as though i am upgrading from M30 to M31.
All lies. Poor finger lock sensor. Poor camera.. all crap advertising.
M30 was way better.
This phone hangs too . I am over Samsung now.
-----
Good at this price.
-----
Nice display at this cost,good battery back up but takes long time for getting full,camera quality .only thing I dont like is the size, looks so fat but we can't expect it to be slim having 6000mah battery inside.a little bit heating problem also arises and hangs sometimes even though having 6GB ram.
One more good thing is so light weight even having 6000mah battery
-----
Really a Mega Choice
-----
Really a MegaMonster and all rounder Mobile with in this budget category.
Very Good Mobile in this range to have all that you want from smartphone.
I bought it next day of its launch and believe me, not a bad decision, earlier I was waiting for Redmi Note 9 Pro launching on 12th March. But now no worry. Great deal and suggest you to snatch it.

Value for Money product by Samsung
-----
I like the tech specs (battery, camera, perfect screen size for cell phone) but don't like the thickness. And that's why gifted it to my brother :)

The ONLY expectation not full field is sleekness of cell phone like Mi or Samsung A series, if you can work that out.
-----
Absolutely magnificent phone
-----
The mobile is bestest best in its segment. 6000mAh battery goes more than 48hrs easily. The camera is absolutely magnificent. There is zero battery drainage. The one thing that attracts the most is the Super Amoled Display. Thats so much gorgeous. Each and everything in this mobile is uniquely produced. Don't thing but buy.
-----
Most economical with highend features
-----
Amazing quad camera. Wide angle pics in normal shot. Great depth good quality. Sleek phone design with good inbuilt speakers. Loved it. Youcant expect this much in economical and pocket friendly price. Dont compare with iphone and other high cost phones. Its best in its own price range.
-----

Love‚ù§Ô∏èSamsung M31 Super Amoled Display
-----
Bad Indoor Selfies!!! Sound Is Low!!! Superb Main Camera!!! Great Slow Motion, wide angle!!! Fall In Love With Very Smooth Super Amoled Dislplay!!! For Regular Use Go For Samsung M31

I L‚ù§Ô∏ève Samsung M31
-----
Best unlocking!! Better battery! Good camera
-----
Camera quality is good but poor at low light and too much of photo compression takes place every time and results less detailing and sharpness .
Fingerprint reader is one of the best sensor in this device and very fast and accurate.
Battery life holds nearly around 20-24hrs for a normal usage and with 4G data and gaming usage gives a standby around 12 hrs .
-----
Amazing battery life and Camera
-----
The phone is very user intuitive and easy to use. The core features such as long lasting battery and quad camera are on the spot. From the day of purchase without heavy usage of my phone the battery lasted for almost 3 days. The phone is not too heavy for its size because of its plastic body. All in all the phone is packed with goodness for the price its marked for .
-----
Nice mobile
-----
Battery backup 5/5,camera 3/5 fingerprint 3/5
Display pictures quality 5/5
-----
Dont buy
-----
If you are a little careless and drop it from one feet, your display is gone. There are better choices at this cost

Decent Smartphone under 20k
-----
Got the phone in just 1 day of order, thanks @Amazon
The phone seems bit heavy but with 6000 mah this is ok
Camera both front and rear are awesome at daylight..Images are bit jittery at night ..also found image stabilization issue with moving images.
Performance  wise it's one of the best in this segment
Overall it's a great product from samsung
-----
Problem with fingerprint sensors and battery charging
-----
Fingerprints sensor not working  properly, after uses of 1-2 days fingerprints not working i need to delete old and add fingerprints for reuse,if this is a software  problem then fix it as possible fast and if there is a hardware  problem i want to replce my phone.
Other big problem  is a battery charging  it's  takeing around  4-5 hour to charge full battery.
-----
Excellent
-----
Phone is started working fine.. The look and performance are awesome. Need to check whether performance decreases with increase in usage time...
-----
MegaMonster Its True
-----
1. Screen is so awesome by its brightness and colour quality.
2. Battery is really a monster 8+ hours battery life Onscreen.
3. Cameras both front and rear are really awesome sharp and
  good quality of pictures.
4. For PUBG lovers best for them good graphics and Better performance.
5. I am very happy and thankful for Samsung and Amazon too.

Phone resets automatically and hanging and so much heating phone
-----
I am purchased Samsung m31 with 6GB ram and 128GB internal memory in that I am getting the problem of phone reset automatically this happened 2 times and battery charging very slow  I am lost my total data
Phone is hanging I am want to return this mobile please help me to return the mobile
-----
Review after 3 days
-----
Build quality and size to weight ratio is very good.

Camera is satisfactory ( not getting sharpe photos as good as from my samsung S7 ) but still good.

Battery is awesome,  I am business user. Really needed to charge my S7 twice a day. But with same usage I am able to go 1+ 1/2 days.

+ + for performance and battery.
-----
Best in segment phone
-----
I have been using the phone for past 5 days. As of now i feel, sumsung has kept their word regarding the specs provided. Camera quality is impeccable. Display quality is out of the world. Even though the phone is powered by a 6000mah battery, u wouldn't feel that its heavy. Phone is perfectly balanced in terms of body weight. In short, im in love with this mobile.
-----
It is really a mega beast
-----
What a mega BEAST completely secured phone by samsung you need not worry about any thing samsung inbuilt features are very useful in set up of phone as wll as exploring the features of mega BEAST the cameras good natural colors and amoled display is at its best and the main highlight 6000mah battery is very much fascinating but it heats up while charging the phone
-----
Poor
-----
Camera quality is very poor. Not as expected. 6000mah battery is just a marketing tool for them to hide other problems in this handset
-----
A powerhouse mobile!!
-----
The M31 is a powerhouse mobile. With its gorgeous blue cover and sensitive finger print scanner, the strong set of cameras, that give you all possible variations in photography. The mega storage capacity and excellent processor all make for an exciting device in your hand- be it gaming or Netflix or photography or music... The Samsung galaxy m31 is going places!!

Want to retun but amazon sucks..cant return..dont buy this phone
-----
I didnt like this phone at all.
Build quality is bad.
Phone is very thick in size
doesnt look like 15k phone
Camara is average
sound is average
Display is the only thing I liked
I tried to return this phone Amazon sucks ..you cant return phone now but only replace..
DONT buy go for Note9 or Realme 6 or poco x2 inthis range.
-----
Best buy smartphone at Rs. 15000. Don't miss out on this one!!!
-----
Best phone under Rs. 15000 category.
Comes with superb Amoled display.
Best in class squad camera with 64 megapixel.
Best in class battery with 6000 mAh.
Comes with fast charging.
Placement of all 4 cameras is superb.
Exynos processor is very good in use.
Overall a best buy product.....don't miss out on this one.
-----
There are bad phones, then there are worse phones and then there is Samsung's M31...
-----
1. Never Catches 4G signal
2. Heats Up a lot
3. Worst battery performance
4. Even basic WhatsApp call is a challenge with this phone with such low signal reception
5. Really slow fingerprints and face scanning

Conclusion: don't waste your money on this phone... better buy something else..
-----
Phone Worth the cost.
-----
I received my order on 19 March 2020...
And, as per expectation the mobile phone,look and camera is good and worth the price..
The RAM and ROM(6+128)GB gives it fine flow of phone gives a super phone in which samoled diaplay gives a quite pretty appreciation...
For approvement-Looks should be slim and attracting..
Overall mobile phones is good

MegaMonster
-----
Nice and handy phone for the budget. Camera is good battery is great (phone weight is very well balanced with the size of battery)and UI is super cool. Back panel is too pale. Surprise that Samsung not providing additional protective layer to screen and back case.
Overall a decent budget phone with a Samsung tag.
-----
Great value for money
-----
Never expected that samsung would be launch this kind of specifications for this much prize and screen is really attractive
Battery life was good but charge carefully because it gets really hotter except that each and everything is great

In this range this mobile is a Monster. Awesome display. Amoled display is so good and soft. Battery is perfect with 2 days without charging. Camera is too good. I love this mobile. #Valueformoney. #Go4Monster.
Little bit disappointed with the back cover as it seems plastic. But with good case cover it will be fine.
-----
Amazing phone :)
-----
I was looking for such phone for last few months. Dont think too much just buy it. Processor performance  is also seems to be good, no hangs. Pictures are very fine no doubt camera in samsung as been improved. And the battery, you can travel with this phone without charging upto 48 hours with normal use. Thanks samsung and thanks amazon for this amazing phone.
-----
M31 Marvelous to Median users
-----
Fingerprint - Sensor is really good and safe by providing the relevant protection near to sensor (thought by keeping mobile in surface would damage the fingerprint sensor asset)

Camera - Quality is really good but only thing is options are not seen exponentially need to search lot and explore

Batter life - Its really worth and experienced
-----
The best beast you can get!!! üëç

The Samsung M31 is amazing on it's,

Procs and cons after 3 days
-----
1. Good screen.
2. Camera quality is good.
3. Sound  quality  is average.
4. On edge it is high sensitive for that I'm using  edge touch from play store.
5.Build quality  is ok
6. Inbuilt app like lock or hiding photos and videos apps  not available.
7. Call quality  is good.
8. Video call quality  is average.
-----
Except battery backup everything is good
-----
Camera quality is good, I am writing this review after using 20 days, everything is good except battery life, which is below expectation, expected more from 6000 mah, I won't play games, won't watch video, in internet will be on, what's app and few voice calls only I do, for this limited usage itself battery drained by day end.üòî
-----
Great phone
-----
Fingerprint reader does not recognise my print on every occasion, sometimes it prompts me for pin.
Camera although is good, with great resolution.  But, in wide angle  view, colour is brighter than original object.
-----
Very nice, definitely exceeds expectations
-----
I have both M30S and M31 now and would like to appreciate Samsung for making such great products at this price point. Truly a 5 star product.
-----
Monster will not let you down (Samsung Galaxy M31)
-----
Before purchasing this monster, I was 50-50 with my decision but now after using it for 10 days. I can say that It is a real monster in this price range and the spec coming with device are amazing.

I strongly recommend to go for it. It will not let you down.
-----
Good mobile
-----
Battery takes some more time to charge around 4 hours but almost stays for one half to two days of regular usage.. touch, camera quality is good.
New apps like Samsung max and camera edit options are good.
Fingerprint and facial display is less sensitive ..
Overall good one in this range
-----
As of now the best phone in the price range in the market
-----
The best phone I have had so far.The finger print sensor is  excellent and very  sensitive. The camera quality is very good and  the best part is the battery life which I have to charge once in two days for which I am very much thankful  to Samsung Galaxy 31.The screen color and the sensitiveness is excellent.AThe best phone in the price range
-----
Recommended
-----
People looking for smart budget phones upto 20K ,then you're eyeing on the right product,I recommend you this epic budget smart phone with
every features required in this technological world . Samsung is the best in all auspects as they design products with quality without compromising.  I recommend you all if looking upto 20K.

Bundle Mega Monster
-----
The best in the class. This has all the features from fingerprint reader to otg. From Camera to battery,  from sound to wifi calling. From 1 hand use to VR option. Much morethis monster have...
Worth buying since it's launched.
-----
This one called a complete phone...
-----

Samsung m31 real monster
-----
Awesome phone with great video graphic experience and camera shots.
One can watch videos movies in full screen .
Battery life is awesome and can last for 2 to 3 days with normal daily and entertainment task of yours
Because of wide internal space problem of getting phone hang again and again never occurs. You can play games of high resolution.
-----
Good quality phone.
-----
Good quality phone in this price segment for a big battery &amp; non gamer user like me. Display quality of Samsung phones are super. Also, this phone is slim and fit. I like its camera editing quality of background black&amp;white and focus colourful. Charging time is little bite slow against this big batteryhouse but it is not a really big concern.
-----
overall good product
-----
Battery life could have been better (with 6000 mAh capacity inside, feels though as 4000 mAh)
Used honor 8x with 3800 mAh battery and was better i feel.
Fingerprint sensor is fast, camera in low light or at night a par (but not the best)
charging to 100% is around 3 hrs
overall 4.4
-----
Best
-----
Best mobile from samsung at rs15999 for 128 gb storage and 6 gb ram.
But it should have support of 5g also.
I always bought samsung mobiles and it my 20 th smartphone which I bought from samsung
-----
Below expectation
-----
The phone Is not that cool it's battery life is not good it takes 3 and half hrs for full charging and that's not 'fast charging'.Its camera quality is not so good like redmi or realme and it's  RAM  not fulfill my expectation it starts hanging.Overall not to buy if you have better options like redmi and realme for this price.
-----
Don't think go and buy Samsung galaxy M31!!it's jus awesome üëå
-----
1.Display clarity very nice(s amold)
2.Battery backup awesome 6000mah.
3.camera outstanding 64mp and night mode is very very clear and good.
4.sound effect chanceless (Dolby 360)
5. I love blue.. this ocean blue looks so classy..
6. Suitable for budget .. Reasonable price with all good features.. simply go for it. No second option.

My m31ü§©
-----
The camera is awesome,especially 64mp back camera .the picture have lot of details in the macro shot.processor is good .a very good budget mobile .even though price is low the phone is nice.i bought tht on 1st sale day.the only problem is sometimes the keyboard is hanged. The battery of the stay 18 hours continuous use of network.im really loved this mobile
-----
Buy it you will love it
-----
Best battery life I have ever had, lasts me about 1.5 days with heavy usage
Camera quality is great does the work better than almost many phones out there
Fingerprint reader is on point and accurate and it's very fast
Super amoled screen is the best to watch movies
This just might be the best phone in its own price range
-----
Budgeted Phone
-----
That model is quite good in this range launched by samsung. It looks good and battery life of that phone is impressive. But the camera quality is not so much good as a 64 MP camera quality. In other scenarios, this phone is the budgeted phone . You can try if you are looking for a phone under 20,000 ,rupees with a brand name.
-----
Monster camera and battery life
-----
I've been using this phone since a week and the amount of satisfaction I got with this phone is immense for the price that I paid... really glad I bought this piece of technology, I totally recommend this to everyone who gives more priority for the brand and around this price range the battery backup and camera quality is rare...so I'm happy with my Choice
-----

Overall it's a great phone with premium looks.. I rate 5/5
-----
If you want a mobile phone with great camera and battery life Samsung Galaxy M31 is the perfect phone for you. I myself have redmi note 7 pro and bought M31 for my phone and camera quality is enormous and battery is great. If you are moderate users(4-5 hrs a day) on internet it works for more than 2 days.. Fingerprint and face lock features are also great..
-----
5 star
-----
I wanna tell u something  it is the best I have ever used  because it  has super amoled display  due to that I feel very comfortable when I touch the screen . Second thing is battery life  I mostly charged my phone in two days the battery life is awesome .
From my opinion  you should buy if u want a new phone  under 15000.
Thanks
-----
M31 IS REAL AND ONLY MONSTER.
-----
Thank you Samsung for the monster,

"Battery life"/battery back up was best among all the smartphone I have used,
Cherry on the top was "camera quality" and camera modes (thank you for helping us to capture best moments of our life)
"fingerprint reader" was making our important data/privacy much more secure than before.
-----
Overall a very good phone in all challenges
-----
The phone performance is really awesome. The weight balancing of the phone have done well with the 6000Mah battery. The display of this phone is superb in which we can see all ultra HD videos and 4k videos. Camera is really nice mainly the back camera with 64mp is very good for take interesting photos. Overall this phone is the monster of midrange phone.
-----
Totally worth the price
-----
The phone's camera is good both front and rear. I love the Colour of the phone (Ocean blue). The Battery life is good lasts for over 24 hours. The design of the phone could have been better and lighter.
The phone comes with a fast charging charger however,  it takes around 2 and a half hours to charge my phone to 100%
I am happy with the phone.
-----
Overall, it's worth it for the price range.
-----
Great option of Smart Switch by Samsung. No hassle after changing the phone. Performance is good. Camera is also good but not great for close up pictures is what I noticed. I expected a longer battery life as it has a monstrous 6000Mah.
-----
Very Good budget phone.
-----
Good phone,Nice display,Good battery life,photo quality very good in day light or in room lighting also  ,Low light photo capturing average, should have been better, Over all good budget phone.
-----
Everything Samsung Galaxy m31
-----
The Smartphone is overall a great value for money. It is light weight for 6000mah and camera quality is good. Though NIGHT shots doesn't have that much details. Lacks Bixby. Battery backup almost 1.5days heavy usage. Fast charging is enough. Overall design is awesome. The display is the best in price segment as with every Samsung device.
-----
Screen breaks easily !
-----
My phone fell out of my pocket, and the screen cracked. It was hardly a 1 meter drop and still the screen broke. Really disappointed with the screen. I have previously used iPhones and dropped it several times and nothing happened.
-----
A really good phone.
-----
Lots of plus points. Especially the fact that it has a battery that lasts for about two days after only charging for about 2 hrs. The only drawback I have faced after using it for a few days is that the phone heats up while charging at first. It has decreased and I am guessing that it will be solved after a while of usage.

New UI is good, with Android 10
Overall good in it's category with it's price,

WHY BUY M31: A great MegaMonster.
-----
Love this phone. Bought it 2 days ago and now I am impressed by its performance. All features in this phone including the camera, biometrics, battery life are satisfying my needs. Also the processor is allowing a great gaming performance and a great overall performance. Working very smooth. Also the outside looks are great. Rightly said: MegaMonster.üòÅ
-----
Best features, affordable and trusted brand. Go for it!!!
-----
Great phone in the price range, equipped with amazing cameras, both main and selfie. Fingerprint and face id are fast as well. And the best feature for me is the battery life...no frequent charging even after heavy usage. Also very light and handy considering battery capacity. Samsung's brand name always makes decision easier. Certainly recommended!!!!
-----
It's a monster phone with monster benefits u won't regret !!!
-----
Trust me u can't get anything better than this in 16K
128gb
Fabulous finger senser(I find it more better behind)
Monster battery back u
I can charge it over night it turns off after 100% automatically and then 6000mah battery lasts for like infinity in front of other costly phones

Great phone go for it
Value of money
-----
A branded phone with superior specifications at a price advantageat
-----
Bought this after specs and price comparison of various models released in the last 3 to 4 months as I wanted a phone for normal use minus games.  One star less because ejection pin was not supplied.  Your vendors take the pleasure out of online shopping by not supplying 100% of what is promised and paid for.
-----
Good mobile device in the price
-----
Samsung launched M31 in reasonable price with decent features, the best part I like it is about the heat. I have been using from last 4  days and I don't see any heating problem.

Camera quality is good and getting good shots, the processor is up to mark, I can say it is the best in this price range
-----
WORST MOBILE EVER
-----
This is the worst mobile ever i have purchased it. It hangs on in every 5minutes. There is something setting in this mobile that it was working properly for f√¨rst 12 days, th√®n its problem started. Thats I couldn't return it because of the retu≈ïn policy. "NEVER GO FOR SAMSUNG MOBILE".
-----
Overall device is good but camera has some problem in night shooting
-----
Overall this device is good and it has some ossum features of software but I face some problem in camera recording in night light(led bulb or tube light). Camera quality is very good in day but not able to maintain quality in night even in tube light or led bulb.
-----
Nice
-----
No hand phone in box
-----
A Real Monster Phone in Budget.
-----
Camera is really good with an ability to take sharp pictures.

Battery Life is good as you can use it for full day without worrying to charge the phone.

Binge watching is also a real pleasure as display quality is awesome.

It has wonderful.display it's working is superb and battery life is huge normal users can expect 2 days ....gestures are good....only thing I disliked abt the device is face recognition  is bit slow and game boosters  need update that's all  rest everything is wonderful fully satisfied with amazon services got a product within a day üòá
-----
Amazing
-----
This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.
-----
Simply superb , one of the best in market with reasonable price
-----
As this was my first samsung product I felt as below
Pros:
Full Charging time : around 90min to 120min from 0% to 100%
Standby of charging : till the next day avg it reaching to around 50%
Camera: simply superb
Cons:
Nothing much as of now, but expected charging time some wat low but still it is good enough.
-----
Overall good phone in this budget.
-----
Fingerprint is not that much quick but yes reasonably good response.
Camera quality is also good.
Though it say 6000 mah battery but it does not stand for 48 hours. On an average it gives backup around 26-30 hours for average use. But overall it's good phone in this budget.
-----
Complaint
-----
Dislike, because my galaxy m31 bought on 7th March 2020 is not working for the past 3days. It worked only when charging time. Now it has stopped working yesterday onwards. During this lockdown period what should I do to get my mobile repaired or provide with a new phone at your earliest convenience. Thanking you anticipating an early reply.
-----
Don't think, Go For It.
-----
The phone has an unbelievable battery life as advertised, as I tested it for a continuous 4 hours of video call and the battery went down only 20%. The amoled display is amazing, with some amazing lockscreen functionalities. The gaming performance is exceptional with PUBG playing very smoothly on high graphics. All in all, it's a catch at this price.
-----
Perfect phone for traveller's.camera, battery,display champion in 15k
-----
Excellent mobile
This all rounder mobile
But this mobile not for playing pubg game.
If ur pubg lover dont buy this mobile
I am fan of prasadtechintelugu
And greeky ranjit
This two youtubers recommend for who has not playing pubg people's.
Buy this phone blindly every inch worth for cost
-----
Really a mega monster üòçüòçüòçüòç
-----
The overall feel is really good.
Gives a premium look as the display is really smooth. The colours seems to be perfectly amazing üòçüòç and the performance also satisfies the name #megamonster.
You won't regret buying this device üëçüèª.
Battery life is better than expected as 6000 mah really works as a beast.
-----
Worth for money paid!
-----
Awesome phone.
Normal use- 2days backup without charging again.
High net usage- full day backup
Charging is fast in 1hr nearly
Soft touch screen
Smart cameras both rear n front
Intelligent sensors
Android 10 very useful
I appreciate the space black color elegant one.
I hope it keeps up same in future too.
-----
Not jackpot
-----
Not worth the hype.  Camara is good, but not very very good. But it is worth the money.
In the river, I mean the product is worth the money, not as jackpot.

Battery still will drain lol fast. 1 day charge is required

Samsung Galaxy M31 is very good mobile under this cost by samsung.The phone display is awesome and nice UI but one disappointing thing is it lacks some speed.This phone is light in weight and very compact to use.It feels great to use than other phones.The battery is too big and sustained very long but i think samsung could give more fast charging.

Increment Upgrade over Galaxy M30s
-----
Except for the camera, most of the features remain the same as Galaxy M30s. Overall it is a good buy. However, it would have been better if they have provided upgrade SoC, and added few features from Galaxy A series such as Kid mode, secure folder, edge screen, edge lighting, etc.
-----
Worth it what you pay!!
-----
Good product at best price.. better connectivity (i feel signal strength and wifi is good), best camera, battery is good as i have connecting my office through  mobile atleast 10hrs. Eventhough  big battery  you dont feel weigh on hand! Design also simply superb.as usual Samsung  AMLOED display  always  attractive. Totally worth üëç
-----
Samsung is back with a bangüôÇüôÇüôÇ
-----
So far so good. Good battery  life. Camera quality is good as compared to redmi (I am using note8 pro). Clarity of image and can capture details. Processor is good for non gamers. Very good display just loving it . Finger print sensor is working fine. Overall a good product at this price range.
-----
Need some updates
-----
The phone is not up to the mark got heated during the call and look like a ordinary phone not feel that u r using a Samsung phone face lock did not work smoothly
-----
Satisfactory
-----
Good quality Camara both front and rear. In day light results are much better. However results in Night are poor and not up to mark.
Location and design of Fingure sensor is not satisfactory, sometime we have to find it by turning back.
Speed and display are the best part and USP of this handset.
Overall good handset in this range.
-----
Awesome phone ...worth the price
-----
Amazing phone by Samsung..every features in this are perfect that too under this price range ..battery backup is superrrr...camera is also awesome..u can see pictures above which I have taken on m31..one little issue is phone heats up when u play pubg.. other than this everything is good..worth to buy ..totally I liked the product...‚úå
-----
Worth buying
-----
I was in doubt about the blue colour bcz the black was unavailable when I ordered. But the blue colour is really great. Battery life is amazing. Camera quality is great. The screen is great. Supports 4K videos. Overall it's really great.  I do a bit of gaming also. Not for hardcore gamers but the lad and stutter is rare. Totally worth the money.
-----
A Worth it Hanset
-----
I really loved the handset. Its Battery backup is awesome and really a worthit hanset. Its camera quality is also awesome as compared to handset price. If any bussinessman or Who is having more work on hanset daily its veey good hanset or them. I only disliked the Charging bcoz its not a Fast Charger. So due to only Charger I will rate it 4 Star
-----
Clearly a winner and monster
-----
As expected battery life in very good.  On rear camera front this phone is real winner. Front camera need little improvement.  Body structure is much good than what i expected.  Screen is very good would have been much happier  if had gorilla glass 5. Overall phone is very good. No heating issue and not getting hanged in heavy use.

I recently brought  Samsung galaxy M31 , 6 gb, 128 gb.
Pros- Smooth gaming experience,  sound quality is amazing and camera quality is out of the box. Even you open so many tabs at the same time but still it never hangs

Cons- till now only battery  drains a little fast but not that much.
-----
Valuable  Customers  Request

Best purchase from Amazon. Mobile is uptown the mark performer. Just one thing that Amazon can do to its customers  is to give back covers and other small gifts, it would be appreciated. We are your loyal customers and I think it's valuable to you.

-----
A Special phone from a brand Samsung.
-----
A unique phone from a brand like SAMSUNG at a low price range, it really impress with its camera quality and big 6000mAh battery life.
-----
Not a bad purchase but not a great one either
-----
It takes way too much time to charge, for a fast charging phone this is very disappointing, but the battery life is good.
It's barely been two days and my phone has already changed twice, not happy with this at all, the camera quality is  good was a 16k phone but I do notice a lot of airbrushing in selfies which makes them look artificial.
-----
Beast
-----
I bought this for a friend and the battery is beast. 2-3 days he is getting backup. The look is fabulous and I liked the mobile overall.
-----
Delighted
-----
I bought a new Galaxy M31 week ago. I am delighted by the product. Worth more than the price. The camera is awesome and battery life is unbelievable even after using hotspot feature. Will definitely recommend to others.

Megamonstar except camera
-----
Writting review after using 8 days. This phone is good by performance. Battery life is superb.

But very much disappointed because of Camera, I brought this phone for camera but very much disappointed after clicking photos, very poor quality camera given by Samsung.

I would say its Megamonstar except Camera.
-----
Satisfied
-----
Phone is good..pls change Camera setting before use..it seems default camera settings are not good which gives disappointed in first go..but when I changed settings and clicked pics it worked for me
-----
Very disappointed
-----
Do go for this model.. this is wrost phone in this price. I have been using since 3 months. Phone is getting hot with usual suffering and also hanging. Battery drainage is very fast. 3 hrs to take full charge.
-----

Black Beastüî•
-----
The first thing is the best quality  product  in this range.  In terms of performance  phone is very good. User interface  is very attractive.  The battery  backup  can last up to 2days depending  upon  your use. Very good for photography, if you have skills  then you don't need DSLR camera.  Look is very stylish and bold. I love the product .
-----
Good phone for budget
-----
The battery life is good. Audio and speakers  are good . Easy to use.

Display is big but looks dull and static( my best half has s8 so may I didn't feel encouraged).
charging is not as quick as it said to be. Native  Samsung browser is more resolution  friendly than chrome. Text is garbled in chrome for given screen dimensions.
-----
Clean Model!.
-----
Phone looks good. But i think battery is draining little faster. It could probably be because of low signals in the place where i live, the battery is draining out fast. Otherwise all good.  Best in the lot in the market to pick in a budget mode.
-----
Worst product waste of money
-----
Worst product ever from samsung , battery life so poor only in few hours handset get discharge to 0% fake 6000mah battery , and just in 2 days device start hanging , worst product from samsung never recommend to buy this product ,, waste of money
-----

Bad experience
-----
Sound system is not working and camera quality is not expected as 64mp and 32 mp .Very bad camera quality
-----
Worst network connectivity
-----
Worst smartphone I have ever purchased.  MI 16 MP cam gives better photo than the 32mp cam of samsung. The worst thing I found is network issue. You will never get full network anywhere. Internet speed is lil bit more than 2G network. I rang to the customer service and they advised me to change the sim cards with new sim cards.
-----
Very heating mobile really disappointed
-----
My mobile was very heating continuely use 1 hours very heated battery life 1 day only really disappointed use Samsung m31s
-----
Worst phone.excess heating issue.customer support says everything is fine.
-----
Phone has lot of heating issue..it gets heated on call,charging and when data is on...I purchased this phone on March 6th totally disappointed. Pls never ever buy this phone..and there is no return option..amazon is fake
-----
Try with other model
-----
My Phone is getting  very heat while charging.Mean while ,literally its took 2 hours
and  40 min for full charging. Phone Panel is not good compare with these category mobile.Some times performance lag happening - when we go with two more process simultaneously. When we use front camera device getting very heat.Out of 5 my point is 2.5.
-----
Truly Megamonster!
-----
1)6000mah Battery which easily lasts more than a day even for heavy  usage
2)Quad camera setup gives good performance
3)6.4inch Super AMOLED display is one of the best in this price range
4)Exynos 9611 gives smooth performance even while multitasking
Overall it's complete package if you're looking for phone under Rs.15000
-----
All in one. Best in looking and handling of samsung M31
-----
I have one samsung tablet mobile SM T331 for the last 5 years without any trouble/faults. Hence on that confidence, I purchased  samsung M31. I satisfied all the functions such as taking best photos (camera), more than one day battery life and good response of fingerprint reader. But one negative is poor face sensor. Except that all is good.

Samsung m31 review after usage
-----
This phone is really cool and looking very attractive, function and processor are very smooth,even camera and battery are awesome,as u know display is super amoled so you have no need to think,go for this phone,it's really value for money phone,I am using from last days really  pretty..(Thanks samsung for made phone like that)
-----
ROCKING MEGA MONSTER M31!
-----
Really mega monster is rocking! The main reason for this statement is that quad camera is just awesomeüòáüòá. Crystal clear shots. All most all the features of this mobile admired me. Battery standby is quite long and Fast charging is one of the primary features of this mobile. Moreover such an amazing monster at an affordable price! Coolüòéüòé.
-----
Think twice before buying
-----
Camera quality not good.  Low Speaker sound.Battery charging not fast even after enabling fast charging and charging doesn't stand more than a day for average usage of browsing, apps usage with minimal video playback. I regret the decision taken to buy this mobile.

Go for it..
-----
Best samsung phone with great camera
-----
Nice phone with great camera and an awesome processor. Using it since a week n very happy to own this Samsung Megamonster. Just go for it!
-----
Indeed a monstrous mobile .... Go for it !!!! VFM !!!
-----
Finger print reader is very quick compared to my previous mobile ,camera is at its top class..go some high resolution pics , enjoying taking pics using wide angle option.
Lots of internal options by Samsung as always. Been using Samsung since 10 yrs. Battery life is good as of now , with 6000mah , definitely helpful for my requirement
-----
Great deal!!
-----
This is my first order &amp; review in amazon
Reviewing the M31 after 5 days usage the phone is really amazing can be the best option under 15k. Display is awsome with punchi colours. Camera performance @ outdoors isüëåüëå selfie performance is ok .....6000mah battery mega monster worth of saying it üòò....so blindly go for it the best phone..
-----
Grab M31, hurry
-----
Same old problem in samsung
-----
My new mobile was hanged during an update and not working just one month after its purchase....Due to lackdown I could not visit customer service centre..I am helpless..
-----
My mobile vs my friend's mobileüòÑ
-----
I really like this mobile, but when I compare camera quality with my friends phone camera there was not much difference even though mine is 64mp and their were 32mp. With 64mp quad camera array it should be too much good with compare than their mobile phone camera.
Gaming performance, battery life, look everything is good.
-----
Amazing performance
-----
Amazing performances. Nice fingerprint and it is responsive too. Amazing battery life as a smartphone. Good quality camera in this segment.
One more important specialty about the model is its size and design. Not that much weight is feeling. I am using as my second phone then also manageable.

Nice phone and worth of money.
-----
Not Worth
-----
In the initial 1 week the phone was okay..but the heating is terrible after that...phone getting heated up after 5 mins of usage.The camera quality was good but the battery life is not good as it was stated.Reached out to service center regarding the heating issue but they said it was under the limit.Totally disappointed with the product.

Awesome phone in this Price
-----
Using this phone from last 4 days its working so nicely Camera quality is awesome. battery is also good you can use it one day without charging. Earphones and back covers was not there with phone at least Samsung need to give these things with phone. Few apps are missing in this like secure folders. over all its nice phone.
-----
Value for money
-----
It is worth for every paise you spend,

-Battery performance was excellent

-Rich and vibrant display

-Premium level camera performance

-100% comfort

-After one month of usage I didn't notice any issues.

-If you are an gamer and multimedia lover just go for it fantastic one.
-----
My review after using 10 days....
-----
I like the over all performance of m31. Main highlight are camera (great contrast and colour) and battery(no doubt u will get 1day+ battery life easily). Having a 6000mhz battery u will not fell heavy in your hand. Over all processor performs pretty well.. i will recommend to buy and rest of you use it and decide yourself.
-----
This phone is a dope
-----
I bought this phone as soon as it was launched in Amazon..  have been using it for more than a week now and should tell u neither amazon has disappointed me with the service nor Samsung..  both stand for their brand value. For the phone 5 star rating with all feature and also 5 star rating for amazon for the prompt service
-----
Good
-----
Lovely phone. The amazing battery life and the vivid, bright screen more than make up for some apparent shortcomings. For a 15K phone, this is real good! Great job Samsung. And nice delivery Amazon, I received it the day before the shut down!
-----
The Best one Awsome clarity and battery life the one and only M31
-----
Really Awesome &amp; Value for money  products...
Followings are Some reasons to buy Samsung Galaxy M31
1) 6000 MH battery is really really awesome once I charge battery it goes 1day 21 hours and 11 minut
2) amoled display is is really an expectable clarity is beyond the expectation.
3) go for it highly highly recommended
-----
Amazing phone value for money
-----
I've been using this phone for a week now it's been great the battery life is amazing I didn't feel any lag when played pubg the camera is really good the only problem is the pro mode which only has the iso, white balance and exposure.  Fingerprint reader is good it will take some if ur hand is wet other than that every thing is perfect
-----
Quality at the best price
-----
Rear camera and front camera, battery  capacity, processing speed and all other features like quick face recognition, android version, camera features, in built AR emoji and Bixby
vision are phenomenal.
  Very good  phone at a very affordable price.
  Only one small minus point is 15 watts  charger. It should be above 20.
-----
Best in this range
-----
Fully satisfied with the smartphone, good camera good battery life good performance.
What else one need. Fully reccomend go and buy it
-----
Best phone..Dream phone
-----
This is a complete package. Best camera, best battery, best display,best sound,best performance, gaming at its best.
No lag no issues while playing PUBG. No connectivity issues.

Awesome phone camera blur very good but No sony IMX sensorüò≠üò≠

Very good phone.
1) Battery is very good.
2) display awesome
3) speed of phone Never hang no lack
4 ) smooth and clear PUBG is running.
5 ) camera quality is very good blur is good but they need to put sony IMX sensor also for good photography like Redmi A1
That's why I am giving 4 start...
Thank you...
-----
Awesome Cameras &amp; monster battery
-----
After using it for more than 1 week, I can see this, that this phone is worth the money. I'm a designer and I use phone's camera almost everyday and that is amazing. I never had that amazing experience of clicking pic in such quality and the battery life is just dope. I mean you can't get better than this Galaxy M31 in this price range
-----
Battery drain fast
-----
I bought this mobile 14th march
After 2 days battery drain very fast
5 hours of usage battery drains 55%
Samsung please solve the battery draining issue in next update quickly

Camera super
Display vera level
0-100% charge full in 2.5to 3 hrs
Blue colour very nice
Fingerprint sensor too fast
-----
Good phone in this price range
-----
Good phone if u dnt want to spend much bucks.....Around 15000 rs this phone is worth buying....Good battery life.....samsung has improved camera but still it is lacking....6gb ram storage capacity  is nice.Some features are missing but all we cannot get in this range.Overall nice phone in this price rang. They have not given ear phones
-----
Screen is fragile
-----
It says it has gorilla glass 3 , but it's a lie . It can't survive the slightest fall . The screen is super weak and fragile  , camera is not that good as well . 64 mp camera is a mislead . Also it hangs sometimes
-----
Mobile not working after April 2020 Update

My phone gets stuck on samsung logo for almost like 10 mins it has happened 2 times I don't know the solution of thisand automatically starts again it has been just just 2 days with this phone everything elseis fine
-----
Excellent performance and safe mobile
-----
Excellent battery life ..works wonders with heavy use and 2days battery life..great camera and fits well in my photographic requirements..the best part is its sar value around 0.37, the least in the market .. go for it. Best in this price. Real more than value for money.
-----
Best in class.
-----
Was looking for a phone from some time which is good overall I.e. battery, camera and performance.
M31 really stands out in all those categories.
Also it provides all features you will find in a flagship mobile phone.
Go for it if you do not change mobile frequently.

3. After a week I want to say that company give some battery optimization updates for long life.
4. At last I want to say that please go through it guys you will be very happy to buying it.
-----
Love this phone in budget of 15000
-----
Fingerprint reader is really fast, camera quality is much better than 48mp its 64 mp is very good for me , i take many photos and i am happy with it. I am a selfie lover i like 32 mp, battery life is awesome mega monstor 6000 mah, i love this phone this is my 6th samsung mobile i am a big fan of samsung, keep it up samsung love uüòòü§©
-----
Great phone in the mid-range price bracket.
-----
Even though it has a 6000 mAh battery, it is quite lightweight The battery performance is good, it can easily last for a single day for normal usage with a single charge. Galaxy M31 packs great camera sensors. Photos are vibrant with a good dynamic range. I haven't experienced any lag till now with my 3 weeks of usage.
-----
Superb phone from Samsung
-----
This is an absolute superb phone from Samsung ,firstly great because it was in my budget of 16000 ,secondly because of its huge battery backup which provides me almost 40 hours of battery backup for all my call chats video calls and thirdly because of its huge screen ratio it is very easy to navigate view
-----
Overall it is ok but as per battery usage its not so superb
-----
Overall phone is great in this budget but as per is battery life it's not as great as person think that 6000 mah battery is going to gave u extra hrs of usage may be my phone is defective ..but in my case my usage is normal  not having whole day net usage and i generally not listen music and movies after that it doesn't ran fr a day

Regretted after buying it
-----
Regretted for buying it cheap quality body, video quality not upto the mark, mice quality worst as the person could not hear clear voice during call, no split screen function many more issues with the phone. This is the bad phone from a huge brand. Will be happy if get replacement....my suggestion to buyers don't buy it waste of money
-----
Most preferred mobile..
-----
It's a very good phone from samsung..after some fluctuations samsung came with a good design and operating system and a powerful battery life and nice camera in it.. mostly I prefer this phone to all who wants to buy a phone with a budget of ‚Çπ15000 to ‚Çπ16000
-----
Charging takes long time
-----
Baterry takes hours to get fully charged.  Even with fast charging option on. I putit on charging at 7.30 am with 11% battery remaining and till 12.30 pm it got 92% charged.
Camera quality is not as per expectations.
-----
True Monster
-----
Truly a monster at this price point
1) 6000 mah battery is what makes this phone a winner for me.
2) the quad camera setup also takes some amazing shots.
3) Screen is also very nice.
4) in display fingerprint reader works as a charm.
Over all i am satisfied and will highly recommend this phone
-----
A deadliest  combo of technology and brain
-----
I have use camera since month fingerprint  reader is just like a liquid flow, camera quality  no doubt  as it is 64megapixel best thing is more option and wide angle.Battery like a boss no need no worry for 36 hours full net and utilisation. In corona situation almost I have work from home there is no issue of battery
-----
Attractive display at affordable price.
-----
Overall it's Super AMOLED display, Exynos 9611 SoC and 6000 mAh battery.
Pros.
1. Terrific battery life
2. Attractive AMOLED display
3. 64 MP cam
4. Smooth software experience.

Cons.
1. Poor low light camera performance
2. Processor should be better.
3. Common design.
-----
All good but had network issues
-----
All is good in this phone . But I'm facing slow internet speed and network issue with this phone . Please solve this problem with new update. Overall very good phone and happy with this phone but network issue is one disappointment with this phone.
-----
Good phone
-----
Very good phone to use superb battery and touch

Only cons what I feel is somewhat heavy and speakers are on down side so sometimes when u are in crowd u can't hear the same properly. U need to place the same near to your ears to hear properly.

Rest all its value for money budget phone
-----
Perfect phone and value for money
-----
Great phone , very clear pictures so camera is perfect in day as well as in dim light.awesome touch screen smooth like butter.charge once in morning and forget for charging full day even I am a heavy user of cell.finger print is ok . Over all value for money from Samsung and so timely delivery from Amazon, really happy to have M31.
-----
Total wastage of money in SAMSUNG M31
-----
Phone is heating very quickly. Not satisfied.
Phone is hanging frequently.
Charging problem 6 to 8 hours for complete charge.

Also not informed by company about comprehensive insurance of phone i.e you have to take insurance within one month.

Now I will never suggest anyone to purchase Samsung phone.

Below average phone
-----
Not as advertised. Average phone .
Folks dont
get your hopes high
-----
Best in the segment
-----
One of a best phone available in mid range segment. Camera and battery are standalone along with Samsung one UI version 2.0 provides one a best UI experience. Best bid to for this if looking for a standard one.
-----
Bad experience
-----
Ordered phone through amazon and received in 2 days. Initial opinion is not good..bad voice quality and photos not good in low light. Requested amazon for return but as per them there is only replacement policy
-----
Mobile is good
-----
Samsung should provide tempered glass and back cover like Oppo. Everyone have to search in market for the same.
-----
Worst Phone
-----
Worst Phone. The phone is switching off automatically on 11th day on wards. I want replacement of this phone. But this Amazon is not replacing. Worst experience with Amazon and Samsung m31.
-----
The battery is not like 6000mah.its like 3000mah
-----
Charging is very fastly draining
-----

-----
Very bad phone, design is not good, Camera quality is just like 2 mp camera, want to replace and return my mobile. I Callrd to amazon customer care. they said me that their is no return policy on this mobile. They can replace only. Cheap quality phone , don't buy this , go to any other company smartphone. Disgusting samsung brand
-----
Poor Charging of Samsung M31 released on 5the March
-----
I received the mobile phone among the first Iot of buyers. I am not satisfied with the battery charging aspect. It takes more than an hour to charge although product is said to have fast charging. I will not advise those intending to buy this product with regard to battery charging. I wish I did not buy this product.
-----
Samsung m31
-----
Pros:  battery is good . Display colors are good soothing to eyes.  Comfortable in hands. Looks are good. Easy handling. Overall good product. Good for those who are habitual for watching  amazon prime and vedios on their phone.

Cons :  camera is not that much satisfactory.  No other default I have seen in this product
-----
Best phone ever!
-----
Everything about this budget device i absolute best. Fast fingerprint response time, high quality camera images, amazing battery life lasts for about 2 days.
The touch is very smooth and display quality is far superior than its competitors.
Kudos to samsung for brilliant work on this device.
-----
Please avoid buying this phone
-----
First time gone for Samsung  product and will never go in future. Quality  of camera is not yet all uptown the mark (64 mp). Battery with regular  use will last 1.25 to 1.4 days max. Heating issue is also there. Sound quality avg. Only plus point is samoled  is very good. Better to avoid.
-----
Great phone in affordable price
-----
Excellent mobile phone in this price. Camera is great. Battery lasts for 2 days in one charging. Display is great. I am happy with this product and will recommend this product to all who wants to buy this phone as its low price phone with all high price phone features
-----
Good camera and battery
-----
Very good camera and battery life. Fingerprint reader is located at the back so it can get tricky if you are not used to such phone previously.  Display and interface is great. Overall a great buy at a reasonable price
-----
cheap quality
-----
cheap quality. never expected such a cheap quality mobile from Samsung. over heating. and the it takes 2 hours to charge 50%.. False commitment by Samsung. If you want to by only Samsung.. try A series..
-----
Superb phone
-----
In this price the phone is fantabulous.

I used it for 3 days now and I haven't found any issue/defect.

Camera and battery quality is super.
Once full charge phone can be used 48 hours without charge.

Phone is good but battery charging is very very slow

Review after 2 days of usage.
Pros:
1) Battery backup. Lasts 2 days for moderate use of Internet and calls.
2) Build quality is good.
3) Display is good.
4) Normal apps working smoothly. Did not check games.

Cons:
Very very slow charging. It took 2:40 hours for charging from 35% to 100%.
-----
Good phone in this segment.
-----
Display is good. Dts sound with earphones good. Camera quality good both front and rear. Phone sound quality good when attending calls. Provision for wifi calling. One time phone heated up when charging next it not happened. Battery ok upto 12hrs. Overall good phone in this segment with 128gb memory.
-----
Samsung Galaxy M31 - Best mobile at this price range from my favorite brand.
-----
It's a best phone at this price range, the 6 GB RAM makes multitasking easy. The processor and the RAM doesn't make my battery drain (Thanks for 6000 Mah battery).
Camera quality is awesome in daylight, but the picture has noice during night even at night mode.
-----
A good phone under budget!
-----
Starting with the looks, space black looks really sleek and amazing!
In the start phone was hanging a bit, after using it for a day, it turned out to be absolutely fine!
Rear camera is amazing!
Front camera is good enough!
It's not the made for gaming! For all other stuff it's an amazing phone!
-----
Great product with low SAR and added features.
-----
Auwsome product at this price. SAR is kept low with great features. This is one quality for choosing this product. Camera 64 MP and better than M30S. Added security features, 6000 MAH battery, great storage capacity@ 128 GB.100% satisfied with this product. I would recommend this product without a second thought.
-----
It was worth buying it.
-----
The phone runs really smooth , it has a good screen rate , the fingerprint reader is so fast but the face recognition is average and the screen to body ratio is also so good..its too easy to operate with just one hand..nd it has better screen resolution too. It is worth 16k. Best phone u could have in this range.
-----
My First Phone from My Earning, Samsung Galaxy M31
-----
This verry good mobile in this price. This Fingerprint Reader is verry fast, Camera quality are good, and Battery life is very good. Phone performance is Good. No heating issues. Bettry life is around 2 day. No need to carry powerbank. Because it has 6000mah Big Battery. Phone color is good. Use screen gaurd or TPU back cover.
-----
Good Product worth buying
-----
1.Display is awesome(samoled)
2. Battary (6000mah) back up more than 1day any condition
3. 64 mp camera is better than its predecesor m30s as compared and front camera 32 mp is also good.
4. not a gamer but phone runs extremely smooth with good internet speed with exynos 9611 shipset.
-----

Excellent phone
-----
The phone is overall excellent, like these many features in a very cheap range. It's amazing. Been two weeks since i purchased it, and it works so good. Just that the work should be done on the face recognition. Too slow to unlock, doesn't recognise all the time. Would be better if they improve it. Overall, this phone is good!
-----
Value for money, the best you can get in this price
-----
I have just received my new Samsung Galaxy M31 this Saturday. I must say this phone is the best you can get in this amount. As it is loaded with all the features and it's USP the 64mega pixel camera is what you don't get even in phone worth 50k and above. I would recommend all the people to go ahead if you are still thinking.
-----
Quality, control, accuracy and speed of Samsung Galaxi M 31
-----
Finger print reader is very accurate and fast.

Battery life is awesome, very fast charging, it takes just 30 minutes for complete charging and last long for 02 days.

Camera quality is very good. Pixels do not scatter, in depth video shooting and photography looks very bold like a DSLR camera.
-----
TaKaTak wala Budget mobile iske siwa koi ho hi nahi sakta üëç
-----
Be aware
-----
The quality of phone is up to the mark.But the phone which was delivered had broken original seal and above it the new seal was pasted.So I request all customer to be aware as delivery process is not trustworthy.Also the phone delivered to me was deep discharged
-----
Superb!!
-----
Best in class display with super amoled display.
* camera quality is really good with isocell as the hardware and software being from the same company compliment  and work really well.
* sharply priced.
* processor works smoothly for all day to day use.
* The UI is also really great to use.
-----
Awesome phone with budget price
-----
Samsung M31 launch on thursday 5th march,ordered on same day and delivered  on very next day 6th march.Battery performance is very nice and camera clearity  is as expected. Mobile is very light in weight  a easy to handle.I will suggest go for this.Awesome phone with budget price *****5star rating from my side
-----
PRO CAMERA PHONE
-----
Best phone. Dont wait and lag. Go for it. MASSIVE BATTERY. BUT there are some cons. Face ID is very pathetic. And also having 6gb ram, cannot play pubg in HDR graphics.
Not a gaming phone
Camera beastüòçüòç. Best camera under 15k.
Camera is fantastic. Overall, BEST PHONE UNDER 15K.highly recommended to buy it.
-----
Worst
-----
Facing major problem , while watching movies &amp; calls, suddenly some time's phone going to switch off automatically.  Don't buy this phone. In emergency situations this problem is going to be big issue.
-----
Expectation Not Met
-----
Camera Quality slightly lesser than my previous A5 serious and battery life is not even one full day. Everytime whenever I restart it is showing android is reading and it takes little time.

I was expecting to give whole day battery life but exactly not. I need to try by not using data.
-----

The outstanding device in this price range.
-----
M31 is super good with AMOLED display and 6000 mah battery üîã for the complete day. The camera too is not bad the only thing is with the network. when I use the same sim in my other mobile that receives the signal better than it. Other than this, the complete device is flawless then it features.
-----
M31 looks like #megamonster to me
-----
I purchased Samsung Galaxy M31 on launch day and iam satisfied with phone performance . Same day I received software update and I have updated M31it . Camera quality is good , fingerprint reader working fine . But yet to correctly analyze battery performance , as of now it is coming full charge for 24 hours.
-----
Super battery and display
-----
Really its Monster .. specially battery ..Easily it's give 1.5 day battery backup with heavy uses ..
Very good super amolef display ..No lags
.No frame drops ..Good gaming and video experience..One negative point ..Charger wire is too short.

Battery takes 2.5 hours to get fully charged from 0 to 100%..
-----
Value for money!
-----
It is a sleek phone which makes it more comfortable to hold. The camera quality is good except for the night mode which was not so impressive. The battery is long-lasting and charges roughly with 2-2.5 hours. The ONE UI 2.0 is amazing! If you are looking for a mid-range phone, you should consider buying this Mega Monster!
-----
Awesome Phone..
-----
Hi
This is my 2nd day with using M31 . So far its really working good . Camera doing an excellent job and the monster battery lasting for the whole day even after heavy use..

Thanks Amazon for the quick delivery via my prime account and Thanks Samsung... :-)

Posting some sample pics too guysz...
-----
Good Phone For The Price You Pay.
-----
The phone as such is good but there were few issues initially but now after about a week it seems to run well and is smooth, the camera isnt as great as it was told to be but honestly for the price it is really good. The phone is easy to use and customisable for your own preference.
-----
A beast in this range.
-----
The camera quality is awesome along with the battery life.
I have been using Samsung Galaxy smart phones (for a decade) starting for Galaxy S2 and I was never more happier with the camera quality.
The finger print sensor on the back works like a charm.

A great asset to have.
-----
Dont Buy, Worst mobile phone
-----
Worst mobile phone ever at this range. Poo camera quality, night mode is also bad. Completely worst sound quality. Battery runs only one day, not a  6000mAh.

Don't dont dont buy.....
-----
worst network and internet connectivity
-----
this phone lacks to provide the basic service expected from any mobile i.e. inetrnet connectivity.internet speed never goes beyound 100 kbps even if u hav 100% network bars on display
-----
Is it possible given me dublicate copy of samsung m31 phone
-----
Sir was updating the new software, it was not getting off after the update and today I showed it to the private shop, he called this  phone is dublicate copy of samsung so I am so disappointed to hearing

The best in budget
-----
A top of the line smart phone with best feature and right price.The phone sticks all essential features with good overall performance.  No lag issues, no heating problems. Good finish, comfortable to hold and operate,excellent resolution and durable battery life.Overall a winner in the segment.
-----
Charging complaint after two months
-----
Phone get not charged .As the corona issue exist no chance for warranty claiming through samsung authorised service centres..
-----
Average
-----
I'm writing after a month of usage..The camera &amp; battery are good..but when we trun on wifi or hotspot the phone is getting heat..its not normal..and if we use internet also for long time.its emitting heat...not an acceptable level...I'm worried...did this be resolved in any case ?
-----
Battery quality very bad and heats up very fast
-----
I would request  that no one should buy this series though it offers a good battery life but actually  its a false figure the battery is worst it heats up very fast and u can't  even touch its that warm
-----
Galaxy M31 "premium yet at budget"
-----
Samsung M31 64 mp quad camera, with 6000mAh battery keeps it keeps it at podium over Redmi note 9 pro.It has 50% more RAM over Redmi note 9 pro.With 4√ó2.3GHzcortex-A73 &amp; 4x1.7GHz cortex-A53, it is at premium. Definitely a superb launch  by Samsung.
-----
Samsung launched is a Beast
-----
I really like Samsung M series but This time Samsung make a huge different from other m series Samsung m31 is the excellent phone I ever used I loved it camera quality is outstanding and battery life I used whole day but battery never give up if you don't have heavy use battery stand for 2 days I really really loved it.
-----
Over all it is good product with in budget
-----
I like fingerprint reader and good camera quality beacuse of 4 cameras, live focus and macro zoom but about battery life it will come only 1 day, but they mentioned it will come 2 to 3 days if you use continuously for games also.
About processor, it didn't stuct till now but some times keyboard won't work properly.
-----
Bestest
-----
One of the bestest cameraü§©üòç and battery life last long fr more than a dayü§© and there are many modes in the camera
For this storage, RAM, camera and other features the product price is too good and best one i have used in recent days.. if you looking for budgeted mobile with best price and features its too good..
-----
Unbeatable Monster
-----
Awesome phone with great camera, soc, battery, screen, android 10 and prompt delivery

Only issue is plastic body but doesnt matter because of so many positives + great price

Best part: made in India
-----
Just a hype mobile no real quality
-----
This mobile is not what Samsung claims .. All claims are false .. go for MI or oppo phones..

Camera not upto mark of 64 mp.
Battery drains so fast  . Claim of 6000 mah is just marketing stunt  ..

No ear phones and no case and no screen guard comes in package along with mobile  ..

Great mid all rounder
-----
Lemme start with the display colours are vivid out door visibility is good.
Processor isn't orientated around gaming however for a normal user it is more than enough.
Having 4 different cameras is a boon plus there's a great image optimization software
Finally
Battery life is phenomenal
-----
Go for it.. Its worth
-----
I can say
Go for it.
Using it personally
Best budget phone with 4rear camera
n 6gb ram

No heating issues
Best battery backup
Looks n design is awesome
And after all its Samsung so u can have a brand in ur hand at mi, honor, etc other china items at same budget.
-----
Astonishing product
-----
Excellent product in this price bracket. G√≤d battery backup. Super fast in speed. Touchpad is awesome. And finally camera quality is great. It enhances the colours of Holi with vibrant pictures.
Fingersensor face recognition are so good.
Overall wonderful ecperience in 4 days and worth to buy it.
-----
Best device as on date, for this price.
-----
Under this price cap, M31 is the best with regards to features like fingerprint sensors, battery life and even device performance is top notch. It's worth to try one and come to a conclusion of the choice you made. I conclude
by saying, it's the best choice I made for myself.
-----
Buy only if there's a good offer. Don't otherwise
-----
So many flaws. I've honestly tried to love this phone but it's not what I had expected. User interface not so great, it's still from 2012.
Touch screen is not that great. Fingerprint reader is absolutely pathetic.
Buy ONLY if you're getting a serious discount.
Avoid otherwise. Not as awesome as expected.
-----
Best midrange phone under 15K.
-----
Best phone under 15K.
Rear camera is great. But front camera is a little blur which can be fixed by a software update.
Great battery life and fast charging.
Screen quality is amazing.
Fingerprint reader is fast and acuurate.
Speaker sound is good and loud.
And even receiver soung is great.
-----
Good Phone With Reasonable price with Batter, Camera and Storage
-----
I have taken this phone on first day, Battery is awesome, even i can see 3 to 4 movies with 100 % battery, Camera quality is Good, But when we compare with  A 50 , i missed some application like Good Lock apps, apart from them , i have this phone with reasonable price of 15 K with Branded Samsung company.
-----
Network connection issue
-----
After using it I find out that there is a network issue. Because in my old phone I get 4g Airtel connection with out any disruption. But in Samsung m31 4g network connection is poor. It connects to 2g some time.
-----
Overall product rating is below average
-----
Half of the RAM is already filled after deleting all nonsense camera is not very good and very slow charging
-----
Value for money

-----
Nice product  but my screen issue and I returned and recieved same ok nice product
-----
Very nice product  but I suddenly I observed that my screen got a light crack  right side  top and returned it and I recieved same product now it's working well and no issues
-----
worst camera, don't believe in online review and buy..
-----
its more like 14 MP camera they say its 64 MP..
Secondly phone gets heat very frequently for normal use..
Very slow performance even for normal app it will take some time to open.
I made a big mistake buying this phone :(
-----
Excellent phone....but processor is a little bit slow
-----
Amazing mobile...no doubt....but processor could be much better......I personally love Samsung brand
-----
Phone was very good .. some applications  needs to improve,.
-----
Phone touch and camera  was very good , how ever I am facing  singnal problem and in what's app dual app, I unable to find my new contacts after refresh , but in main what's app I can able to view all contacts.
-----
Worth give a try.
-----
Battery is superb. Camera is also good.
Screen better. Hind Look is awesome.
Price is very reasonable for this product with such features.
Compared to MI phone with same price range, it is far better.
Phone is thick and heavy. Headset jack is at the bottom side, sometimes have difficulty in using.
-----
Value for Money
-----
It's a phone that gives you real smooth experience of handling an efficient phone. Screen is superb, camera fantastic and processor fast and battery powerful. The only issue I noticed during two week's use is that after long internet surfing, the device gets heated. Overall it's a value for money phone.
-----
Unbelievable specs for price we pay
-----
Low SAR, No Heat, Great Camera,  2 days battery life, Unbelievable specs for a mid range phone from a top brand.... One small issue I can give is on no IR blast, so TV Remote option is not there. Overall a great phone!
-----
Defective battery
-----
1st time disappointed with Samsung... Using M31 since last 1 month.
1. Camera not at all of quality 64 Mp.
2. Battery is a serious issue. 1st 15 days it was working fine. But after that heating issue reported.  Also even after 6-7 hrs, battery is not charging fully. Going to return this phone.
-----
don't buy this product
-----
it's worst... over heating phone... low camera clarity.... and can't return this product... I try to return this product.. but I can't.... it's worst of money.... don't by dears...

Phone is awesome

Phone is awesome but camera quality and types are very confusing. Battery backup is not satisfactory. Phone heating problems are faced during playing game. Phone processor is also not good. Some time hanged During making call but I love this phone. Kindly updated above concern.
-----
Budget phone with good features
-----
Battery is very good
Camera does the job. Photos are blurred when flash enabled at night.
Face unlock and fingerprint reader is ok.
Not a Gaming phone.
Phone is not that thin but ok.
Overall happy with the product. Worth the money if you are normal user
-----
A good phone for an avarage lazy user
-----
This is a phone with very good battery life, good camera and avarage performance. More over Samsung is a South Korean company. It's made in Noida, India in Samsung s biggest factory.

#MegaMonster Samsung M31
-----
If you don't care for benchmark scores and just want a device that covers the basics needs and has great AMOLED display, has great battery backup and has a beautiful set of cameras, the Galaxy M31 is best in the price segment. Don't forget the 'Samsung ka bharosa' as well. Go #MegaMonster.

Worst camera selfie

Worst selfie. Camera quality is not good. Heating issue. Don't buy. No return warranty. Only replacement warranty. After 70 days of use start battery problems

You won't be disappointed.
-----
Neither a Monster nor a demon..Just an Avg product
-----
Pros and cons are in the same..
Camera quality is not upto the mark but macro lens is quite impressive...
Battery backup is gud but charging tym really sucks...it literally tests your patience..

Don't purchase with so much of expectations..Go with nill expectations so that u will get satisfied.
-----
Trusted brand Amazon and Samsung.
-----
Looks great.
Camera clearity is good but bad in slow motion and hyperlapse. Video stability is ok.
Speed performance is good.
I have to charge phone after 24 hr bcz its drain battery.
Mice and speakers are good.
Lots of love for samsung since I bought my 1st Samsung phone from Amazon on 2013.

Great phone at an amazing price

I am writing this review after 22 days of use
Amazing phone at amazing rate
Camera quality is super and great ROM &amp; RAM
S-AMOLED screen makes better view then other phones. If you use first time S-AMOLED then u r being a huge fan of it.
One cons is that charging cable is too short.
-----
M31 good phone in this price segment
-----
Great in this segment,sensors are pretty fast a little heavy in weight due to 6000mah battery, camera design is very prone to scratches so make sure you use a cover,(clear cover not included) camera colours not very accurate in artificial lighting but selfie cam is really good, design is user friendly
-----
Awesome mobile with best features at affordable price
-----
Fingerprint works well but it needs lock and unlock both feature to update and in camera is good but it pixelate on full zooming it needs software update and  battery life is good 2 and half days at normal use and 1 day when you use hotspot or heavy process like gaming with other applications running.
-----
All in one in less budget

The phone has all qualities in budget samsung really good job its like flagship

Speaker not working
-----
Speaker not working in just 12 days of purchase , due to lockdown I was not able to give it for service center to get it repaired, on 5th may 2020 I have given  the phone for service but they are saying it will take on month to get the parts..... I have really had a very bad experience with phone and the sevice.
-----
Value for money.

It's good product, picture quality is awesome. The only thing is missed I.e. sound quality in this phone.
Overall I like the product.
-----
Total value for money

Sound clarity is amazing, camera features as well pic quality is very good as compared to peers. Gestures and accessibility is very simple and user friendly. Interface is very intuitive. I have been using moto g series for last 5 years, this was an experiment and as of now, it is suiting brilliantly.
-----
Value for money
-----
Awesome battery life, lasts 2 days easily... Great camera, beautiful shots in wide angle as well as portrait, vivid colours... The super all display is stunning. With a quick fingerprint scanner and a processor powerful enough to handle daily tasks with ease, the M31 is a power packed mid range phone

Reviews of Samsung m31 after 22 days uses
-----
Like-For normal user this phone is best in its segment for best camera,  heights battery life ,fingerprints sensor, additional slot for memory expansion, display, good  sound quality
Dislike- Its processor is not good (ok type )for gaming in its segment, build quality not satisfied, not superfast charging ,
-----
WORTH FOR MONEY!!!
-----
Most awaited phone for me. And,it's worth for that time. I am fully satisfied. The 64mp camera performance was better thn expected. Especially nightmode is awesome. And the major thing is the 6000 mah battery. As a moderate user ,It can withstand upto 2 days.Samsung for giving me a one of the best phone in my budget
-----

Go and Grab it. Amazing Samsung M31
-----
The best phone with a great look and a quad Camera gives you a good capturing. Earlier i was not using Samsung but when i switched my mind and i started using, I was like "Wow"
Battery Life is awesome especially for those who spent there times on Mobile phones. And the "fingerprint reader" works very smoothy
-----
Receiver volume is not good
-----
Receiver volume is very less  unable to hear properly during calls  processing time also more  I think this mobile is more focused for camera leaving basic requirements
-----
Camera and battery life
-----

I'm in ‚ù§ with Samsung galaxy M31.... Don't look back. Go for it.
Wifi calling is available in this phone....

-----

-----
Not a good phoNe for the price
-----
It's heavy...and the charging time is like hell...even to charge 30% it takes 1.5 hrs....
Though it says fast charging...it doesnt
-----
Battery, Camera quality
-----
Very good product given the price range, battery backup is good 2 days for sure. Front Camera is too good and 64 MP camera could be better. Samsung Brand is a plus. Using it since its 6-Mar-2020, no issue found yet. Price is a Plus.
-----
Value for money in every field
-----
I have been using this phone from last month and this phone is value for money... Everything about the phone is upto mark.. sleek design , amoled display, awesome camera quality and main factor is its long Lasting battery life.... I only want company to improve its charger.. otherwise this phone worths its cost.
-----
Must buy deal
-----
It is a very very excellent product.I was also confusing earlier before buying this phone but after deciding I ordered this phone and it was over expecting its camera is so good and its main highlight fingerprint reader also so fast with a massive battery life so without wasting your time go towards this product
-----
Pathetic product
-----
Don't buy this phone. We bought this after is launch and suddenly it's mic and earbpiece have stopped wishing for no reason. Hangs a lot even with 6 gb ram. Pathetic product from samsung
-----
.  Don't buy Samsung M 31S phone any more '
-----
It's been 1 month since I bought the Samsung M 31S phone.  This phone is extremely hot while using it. 5 times this phone is automatically turned off.  call and sound coming Display not coming: Is there any way to buy this phone and give it a new one?  .  .  Don't buy Samsung M 31S phone any more '
-----
Nice experience
-----
The overall experience us nice. The phone is slightly fat as compared to other devices but this is just because the huge battery. The UI is smooth as always. The only glitch free UI in the market. The price increased due to gst and it costed me 1k more than usual price but it is still worth buying.
-----
Mega Monster indeed
-----
After use of a week, everything seems super till now. Camera quality is amazing, battery life is also very good and fingerprint reader is also good. Front fingerprint reader would have been better but for this price, it's ok. Fingerprint sensor should have image clicking features. But so far everything is great.
-----
Very good and satisfied by samsung
-----
I bought this phone which is 128gb ocean blue colour at first I thought that this will as my old Samsung phone but I was wrong this phone camera quality was excellent and the battery life was super good  and this phone is easy for setup too so over all excellent
-----
My phone stopped working
-----
My phone stopped working in less than a month, From last 2 days, its just saying "Downloading" and nothing happened till now.
I`m not able to reach out to either Amazon Customer care or Samsung Customer Care. Please confirm next course of action.

Complaint for My Ordered Phone Samsung Galaxy M31
-----
I requested Amazon to please exchange my Phone as This Device Samsung Galaxy M31 which i ordered is Not Working properly
I Called Them on 11/03/2020 for the complaint
I was Told A Technician will come on Sunday 15/03/2020 but NOBODY came
I Request Amazon to please exchange my phone At the earliest
-----
Amazing and awesome phone
-----
Best budget phone.this phone has a 64 mp camera too and that takes pretty pictures. If you want gaming experience this phone is too nice at playing pubg.this has a 6000mah of battery and even after playing pubg for 45 mins only 10% battery was reduced.Nice design. Totally worth it. The screen is looking amazing
-----
Not satisfied with samsung M31
-----
No new update in this phone.No in built app lock. Not compatible to download Good lock app. Not screenshot tile in quick setting.we have to download apps  to use single feature
Redmi phones are better than samsung

Performance is not up to the mark..Phones hangs sometimes but received no solution
-----
Affordable phone
-----
The mobile is overall good. The only issue is with the charging time. It takes around 2.5 hrs to get it fully charged and then also we get only a day's worth of use.
Its slim and very good looking phone. Bought it for my father and he is very happy with it.
Performance wise he is happy with the phone.
-----
Value for money
-----
Perfect for under 15000 if u want a clean ui and frequent clean updates in android.
1 con is that the 64 megapixel sensor is so big that it blurs out the background even if you dont want to do that and the size of 64mp image is small
otherwise best in price range
-----
Charging speed is too slow
-----
The phone is very good as of now..Best thing is battery life..once the charge is 100%  we can use it for 2 days at regular usage.but it takes around 2.15 hrs to charge full..The charging speed is quit slow. That's the only problem I notised as of now.
-----
This is really megga monster I like it.
-----
Fingerprint is not better but face reader is good and camera is best then other battery life more power full Italy work in 3 days with net on and a drak mood it's best  I love this one I m alwys use Samsung first one is galaxy  series not remember 2nd it on 5 pro on this time megga monster this is the best one
-----
Poor front camera and very slow charging speed
-----
Front camera is of no use, cos the quality is very poor.

Battery backup is good but taking around  4.5 hour to get 100% charge. Itni der me to mera 15000 mah ka powerbank charge ho jata hai.

Company is claiming that the phone will be charged in 2 hour 15 min but it is taking too much tym.
-----
Long lasting battery life
-----
The battery life is the major highlight of the smartphone, which no other competitor is offering right now at this price point. That said, we felt that the company could have bumped up the processor in order to give a stiff competition to its rivals.
-----
Battery Beast
-----
It has the best battery life and the best display among any of his redmi and realme competitors. Samsung UI is better than Realme UI. Dark mode is absolutely beautiful. Camera is on par with my expectations at this price range. You can count on this phone. Images are fairy good for this price range.

Samsung  m31
-----
It has been a week I have been using this device nothing  much to complain  about it ,but if Samsung  would have given a glass finish plastic at the back it would be a better experience  .
3 REASONS TO BUY THIS DEVICE
.6000 AMH BATTERY
.S AMOLED SCREEN
.64 MP CAMERA AND A DECENT  PROCESSOR
-----
Waste Product Hangs A Lot. Dont Waste Money On This
-----
Dont dare to buy this mobile this hangs a lot. Lot lot.
Feeling like so depressed after its perfomance.
Bought it for 16000.
Today is 26th march and since 2 days it is behaving so weird.
Bought it on 13th March.
As soon as this lock down gets over, ill quickly contact samsung support.
-----
Fake advertisements, cheating the customers
-----
Really waste of money..  i never ever used this type of cheap phone before. Samsung told that it has fast charging.,  but more than  4 hrs needed to full charge and battery will empty in one day use..
Phone hanging is the other issue..
Plz dont buy this and dont be a fool...
Fake advertisements
-----
This phone is made for the real Indian!
-----
The battery of the phone is long lasting with the moderate usage. I got almost 3 days of battery life with moderate usage with 9 hrs of SOT . The camera performs really well. The phone never lags in performance it's really a worthy product for this cost range.
-----
over heating for just 10 mins of whatsapp call
-----
i hate this phone form my core it was fine for 1 month and then the problems started. overheating for just 10mins of whatsapp call and call disconnects automatically. and will not be able to use any app. want to return it but my bad i cant have to use this forcefully
-----
Awesome phone
-----
The phone is amazing. Good battery life can last up to 36 hours with a good internet usage and video watching. Sound quality is also good. Would recommend other who are looking for a value for money phone. But still couldn't understand why Samsung kills his own other a series models by m series.
-----
Disappointed
-----
Received faulty phone. Very disappointed. No sound output. No video recording.
Didn't expect such service from Amazon. No quality test before sending out the product.
-----
The Best mobile in 16K.
-----
I loved this product, offerd by Samsung. This is a best value for money in this price range, if you want to buy a new phone then you must go for it. Everything is best, display, processor,camera, battery, and everything...

I think this is the best phone in 16K.
-----
M31 is best buy..
-----
Wow I just loved it.... its picture quality is best, sound quality  is good, its looks are nice... nice deal .. must buy product.. from Samsung..
-----
¬© 1996-2020, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates
-----
Its camera quality, finger sensor, gesture control also better as compare to other mobile
-----
Samsung m31 have better quality of camera which is 64 mega pixels.
Its battery is more then efficient as compare to any other mobile in the same price.
Finger print reader is also good and this mobile systems depend on the android version 10.
Android 10 have full gesture control.
-----
Fon got hunged completely after one month
-----
It's only one month the first update of phone came and I updated my phone but during the downloading some error came and now my Fon is in hunged state from last 5 days...... it's neither rebooting even I tried using power button but it still in hunged state......really disappointed from Samsung

-----
Super phone
-----
I happy with performance of battery backup after playing pubg game &amp; awesome video quality of super amyloid display
Camera quality is better but need some improvement in macro settings.
Overall good mobile in rs.15999.
-----
Budget phone
-----
Battery is pretty good but it won't last for 1.5 days if used excess.

Camera is pretty decent in the price range .

Push notification problems for incoming messages when phone is on sleep mode

If your budget is around 15 k then go for it.
-----
Superb
-----
Galaxy m31 has a unique design and supremely super amoled touch as always Samsung give to itself. Battery performance quite good but the camera need to be little bit  improvement required.
-----
Salute to 6000mAh battery.
-----
Nice Phone.Today battery is major problem in all latest highly cost smart phone and Only Samsung is producing
 6000mAh battery till date .One time full charge will work for approx 2 days. This is some unique from other highly cost smart phone.
-----
Poor quality product
-----
After a couple of month of use, phone had started freezing and going in hung state for longer duration. It‚Äôs not even restarted or shutting down at all. Never expected such poor performing product from Samsung!
-----

-----

i often bought the m31 one week ago though now its not yo hot rather than i thought that 6000 mah will be off so hot.but its cooling tech is just great.
-----
Brilliant M31!
-----
A full-tech package with a long battery life even after heavy usage, enhanced and vibrant Amoled display, and a superb 64 MP camera with a wide array of features, capturing every tiny detail. Indeed, a must-buy if you are looking to get a phone in the Samsung M series.
-----
Average mobile in 16k range
-----
Display quality is good
Camera quality is average. Not too much good as compared to other 16k range mobiles.
Battery performance is very poor. Not same as 4000 mAh battery. It's very poor.
Except battery performance other things are average in that range
-----
Great phone in budget.
-----
The mobile is awesome. I am using the Samsung brand after long time and I felt Samsung has done a good job. The display ,the performance, the operating system  everything is absolutely good. The only thing I felt missing was the case for phone. Samsung should note this
-----
GREATEST PHONE IN THIS PRICE
-----
Order this phone on day 1 , and get a next day delivery such a superfast delivery by amazon, pohone is great in this price range, camera quality is superb, ram managment is awesome, totally satisfied for this purchase.
-----
Monsterous leaves me no Options
-----
I have been using Samsung M20, after a year of use I had no reason to change it but Mosterous Camera, 6000 MAH battery and the Light weight made me to go for Samsung M31. The Phone has stunning display, I am really happy that Samsung makes me update every year :) .. In this budget whatelse I could expect..
-----
M31 is beating all mobile under this budget
-----
1.M31 is awesome mobile under this budget
2. Camara is awesome in this budget
3. Battery is also awesome in this budget
4. Brand name is enough (( Samsung )) in this budget
5. I'm using this mobile I'm so happy with m31
I have lots of things to say and I give ratings full 5 of star
-----
Super cool
-----
Phone looks solid and steady.  I like all the features and ram. Giving 4 star cuz they are not giving headphones :)

Useless phone
-----
Really disappointed with samsung this time.When i have started this mobile first time, got a black reboot screen with some commands written on it.Also the camera quality is not good.
-----
Battery performance is of 3000 mah and not of 6000 mah
-----
Battery performance is not as expected.  Full charged battery gets at 20% at day end.  Am not playing any games except Facebook use.
-----
Best phone i have ever used!!...
-----
Just loved this phone. I bought it on the same day it was released. It has a very nice camera quality especially the rear camera. It's battery can last up to 2 days if very minimal use is there, Other wise it last for 24 hours. It is very good looking and it's the best phone I have ever used.
-----
Best phone in price section
-----
To be frank, never wished to use Samsung phone due its issues, heard from many, but thought of giving a chance at last.
Believe me that this is one of the best phone which i have used till date.
Enjoying each feature of it.
Concluding in a single sentence "Samsung at it's best"
-----
WORTH EVERY PENNY
-----
DISPLAY &amp; BATTERY IS OUTSTANDING
DISPLAY QUALITY LIKED IT
GAMING EXPERINCE IS BEST
NO HEATING ISSUE WHILE PLAYING PUBG
FRONT CAMERA OUTSTANDING
-----
Waste of money
-----
Everything seems to good in the beginning but on 30th day Samsung device shows it's reality. An update came and when I download it, it made my device go to sleep mode from which It is in sleeping mode.
-----
Beautifully crafted phone
-----
Beautifully crafted phone with all the functionalities. I really like the battery backup and camera quality.  The back cover looks a bit old fashioned but still cool as most of people cover the phone. All together a good phone at this price range

Worth the cost
-----
This is good mobile worth the cost. The camera is good. Storage is more than enough. The charging takes a while but I feel this is an all round mobile. From 10% to 100% took me more than 2 hrs 30 minutes. The box did not contain the user manual and eject pin as stated
-----
Best budget phone for indian people
-----
Best budget phone for indian people with extraordinary battery performance which keep your phone long last. Camera clarity is also good with both front and rear camera. Don't go on some youtubers video. I am telling you by my experience it is best phone in this price.

A real Megamonster....
-----
This is awesome phone with cheapest price. Camera quality is good and finger print sensor also nice which helps to unlock phone in fine way. Initially battery was getting drain faster but after software update its charging stands up to 1.5 days. Overall look of phone is stunning.
-----
Good for professional usage....
-----
Battery life is amazing...there is a more advanced features...camera quality is so good than any other phone of MI...video quality in youtube is 1080p supported which is excellent....but drawback is no flash notification light on screen...and there is no data speed and daily data usage shown on status bar...
-----
The real Mega Monster
-----
Really a monster...... Booked on 5th March  11:55( 5 min before launch) Got in time as mentioned by site (7-3-2020) Image stabilizing features disappointed in the beginning as pics were not seen naturally but beautified, we have many options for images so really satisfied... worth buying....
-----
Worth buying.
-----
From day one the product functioning is smooth and yes battery life is long
Macro shots are amazing along with 64mp rear camera..

Samsung M31 review
-----
Screen is blurring alternative times.it worst experience. Specially while it's in charging.
-----
Not a good deal.
-----
Poor quality product. The phone battery backup is useless and it cannot be called 6000mah battery phone. Camera quality is poor. Phone supplied to me was defective and had software issues too. The phone kept on vibrating unnecessarily.
-----
Wonderful and Awesome Experienced Mobile M31
-----
The Samsung M31 6gb 128gb Ocean Blue Looks Too good and nice. Works well, speed is too good. AWESOME Experience of battery Life. Camera Both sides are fabulous. I really very Take well Experience of M31. It's a Value of Money. It's all the about the Mobile in one Word. Extra Ordinary in Reasonable price.
-----
Absolutely loved it!
-----
I would really recommend buying this product because it's worth the purchase, I literally didn't have to charge my phone for 2 days straight. Good battery life, amazing camera quality the sound volume is also really good. Samsung has really got a good phone in the market for such maintained budget price.
-----
Nice Phone
-----
Overall a nice phone in this price however the fingerprint is not that accurate. It does regognize a lot of times. The main thing I was surprised with is that having 6000 MH battery it gives the same battery life as a 3000 MH phone. It only runs a day. I guess you can't ask much from a budget smartphone.
-----
Excellent mobile. I give 5 stars
-----
Very nice mobile. Camera and battery as well performance are excellent. Fingerprint works efficiently.

Mobile M31 hanged during installation of update security patch of 01 April 2020. Now not working. Please take immediate action.

Best battery mobile.
-----
Best battery in all mobiles. Camera quality is improved than before. But still zoom camera pics not good. 64 mp camera just ok. Fingerprint reader is working well. From 9 into 10.
Music is good.display superb. Good choice for busy user, because of battery working more than one day easily.
-----
SAMSUNG Name is enough
-----
Samsung m31 is really a good quality phone great large 6000mah battery which loglasted for 2 days camera is also good, touch quality is very nice,face and finger sensors are really fast,blue colour is adorable,in grip it is comfortable,processor was too fast. At all it is a very good mobile in this price
-----
So far so good....
-----
(Review basis 7 days of use) Look and feel is great, amazing camera. The display is good too. The battery is everlasting...one full charge would easily last for at least 36 hours. The charging is a bit slow but that compensates the longevity of it. Good buy in this price segment.
-----
Superb phone in this price
-----
Undoubtedly fantastic phone.. All features are nice.. Camera is good.. clicked some superb photos.. this could have come in 8 GB ram version as well.. Battery life is more than enough for 1 day use.. Using it since last 3 days and happy with overall phone
-----
Samsung being perfect choice.
-----
First time user of #Samsung, Samsung m31 amazing phone on its category, excellent super amold display with mega power backup battery. Aad smooth functioning. Better compare to realme x2 and Poco x2.

-----
Bough this phone a month go. Now one update came and the phone got stucked in the downloading phase and I have no option because of lockdown the stores are off and there is no solution in internet so far.Samsung need to do somethin about it. And now I am not able to work at all

Super Monster Samsung M31S
-----
Super Mobile ... Really Monster Battery ..... with 6GB RAM rest assured there is no Lag and with 128 GB internal memory you never run out of space and even if you can expand it with memory card of 512GB. So all in all it's a Paisa Vasool Mobile

Worst product
-----
Phone is dead, after software update it's stopped working. Due to locked down no help provided from either samsung or Amazon.

Do not buy Samsung product. Worst experience so far.
-----
Awesome phone at this price.
-----
Battery Life is amazing. As we know M31 is having 64mp camera , thou, this phone have ability to capture the amazing photos.
I am slightly unhappy with fingerprint reader , as compare other phone of M series , this is containing slightly slow fingerprint reader. All thou  this is an amazing phone.

All over the mobile is amazing and fully worth for the price, the camera quality is simply awesome as well as the battery life, the one UIbis clean and easy to use, but the only dissatisfaction is the retail unit is not included with a back case, wich would fulfill the mobile.

Awesome performance and display quality and touch is very good, just like very high range phone (one plus). Quad camera functionality  is very nice.Camera result is superb.Battery backup is also nice.Full faciliated smartphone within mid range
-----
2 hours to take full charge and Sound clarity was not there
-----
Overall not satisfied with the product and Full charge it will take 2 Hours time it's very pathetic
And sound clarity was not good very low volume compare to others
-----
Poor Software. Already Hanging issues
-----
The Product was delivered on 7 Mar 2020.
Today is 25th Mar, and there are already UI and Software issues.

After using Xiaomi products for a long time, I came back to Samsung. Thoroughly disappointed

Good Phone . Monster battery backup
-----
Samsung M31 World's highest battery backup  phone it has monster 6000mh powerful battery inside it. Overall phone is good . Am happy that I purchased this phone  today . I enjoy using this phone excellent love to compare this  phone  to galaxy S20 too it can fight
-----
Best Samsung product in this range
-----
The phone has good rear camera.
Battery life is just amazing.
Macro mode is impressive.
Screen is really nice.
Processing superfast.

The only lag in this phone is its 15 w charger which takes it about 2.5 hrs to charge this phone to 100 percent.
-----
Speakers not working - faulty product.
-----
It is a faulty product, speakers not working, finding  difficult to interact with Amazon team during this emergency time.

I did buy Samsung M30s during October, and my experience  was great and hassle free.
Just a faulty product  this time, no comment on the model though.
-----
Best phone to go for
-----
The new monster m31 is a phone full of new technology and its features are amazing. It is value for money. Has good camera with varied features in this range. It's too light in weight
-----
Terrific purchase ‚ù§Ô∏è
-----
I simply loved this M31 ‚ù§Ô∏è.  It is simply beast in camera, battery , display and the list is end less ‚ù§Ô∏è...Iam a Software engineer by profession and I do watch Amazon prime , play Games and a lot more . Battery is charging very fast and it lasted almost day and half for me .The package is also nice .
-----
Not bad
-----
Video quality is not very good and fingerprint sensor is slow sometimes. The build quality feels cheap as of plastic back and will get scratched super easily so not soo durable. Screen Is good, superb battery, real good macro shots, camera performs poor in capturing nature(plants,trees)
-----
Awesome Camera
-----
Awesome quality camera. Both front and back. Battery is not that "Monster performance ". Its like the usual battery performance only. The touch is awesome. Display fantastic. The best phone in this price category.
-----
M 31sreview
-----
The feel and look of it is amazing.. Real momster as far as the battery back up is concerned... the volume and on/off buttons could have been placed on opposite sides...
On the whole a worthy Buy and value for money.

Beautiful display with lack of camera quality.
-----
Awesome product by Samsung, camera quality good but not as much better as Samsung project.
Overall mobile built quality 9 out of 10,
Screen display quality 10 of 10.
Camera 7/10
Bettary 10/10.
-----
Best phone in the price range with all the essential quality to its best
-----
The phone is good and had a long battery life with super screen display
All the functions are perfectly fine in the price bracket plus Samsung trust makes it a best phone in the price range
And for me Screen resolution, Screen quality, Camera and battery are top most criteria
-----
Superb
-----
Awesome phone... actually I'm using only Samsung phones since 2005... now I'm buy m31 in first batch... phone was superb... that battery life &amp; fingerprint reader ; face reader ; camera quality &amp; working speed..ext... very nice &amp; worthbul price in this gadget.... thank you samsung‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ
-----
Super amoled screen is fantastic
-----
Super amoled screen is fantastic, battery life also good, camera was not bad, face id is take a too much time for identity,  better to use fingerprint sensor, then front facing camera portrait was not accurate it's took too much Blur. overall it's good phone in that budget
-----
Important Feature : Long Battery Life.
-----
Phone is slightly long as compared to a uniform size distribution smartphone like samsung m30s.
Fingerprint reader takes way more time compared to redmi smartphones.
Apart from this minor deviations , ita an good smartphone in this range. Its a best smartphone for people who like long battery life.
-----
Detailed rewiew
-----
Detailed rewiew  :
Display quality is brilliant
Battery much more updated as powercharger
Camera modes are superb and quality also nice,night mode have low quality
Body quality is low
Fingerprint is good but some time  problems
Price range wise is good phone in market
-----
Worst Battery backup
-----
6000 Mah battery just show but it drain very fast. first time using Using Samsung mobile, very  bad experience. Maximum 10-11 hours battery back up , when you will not do call , use internet.  Battery backup is upto 4-5 hrs  If you are listening songs, surfing internet &amp; making calls.
-----
Bad product
-----
Purchase this mobile after 25 days. Blind screen and not working phone
-----
Heated so much
-----
Camera , battery , display all good but this product have very big problem , that is its heated so much while we r on call......after 5-6 min on call its heated so much.......
-----
Good phone in this price range and extremely satisfied
-----
Mobile that is worth in this price range. Fully satisfied with the looks, performance, camera and more importantly the battery life. One small thing is the given Samsung charger is not as fast as MI charger. Except that everything is good. And as usual headphones missing.
-----

Lesser SAR value. Value for Money phone
-----
With the specs it is a real Value for money phone. Lesser SAR value of M31 was one of the reason why I shifted from iPhone. I hope i will not be disappointed after using it for few weeks. Key factor for me will be the call quality and security. Will review it further after using it for few weeks.
-----
(Display or resolution issue)Pubg isn't working well on this device
-----
There is a issue with the m31 I bought, pubg isn't working well on this, I m not sure of it's the same with all the m31 phones. When I restart the phone and launch the game display runs smooth for the first time and when I exit the game and launch it again, game display gets blurred.
-----
good all
-----
Best camera, very good battery life, eat body material, average weight, best performance, best display
-----
Great alternative to the boring xioami
-----
Great mobile. Totally worth the money. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for an alternative to xioami. I am been a Xioami user and have been looking for an alternative for the past few months. Happy with the purchase.
-----
Samsung M31 Great valuable product with lower range
-----
Very very Good product I recieve I am really enjoy my new phone with 64 mgpxl camera with best battery back and with large no off ram6gb loved that.

-----
Value for money. A must posses in the budget
-----
Easy to operate and quick response. I feel proud and lucky to have waited and opted to buy it.it has 8x zoom camera which makes clicking photos from a distance that much easier with lots of clarity. It has instant focus.it has real fast charging and ling lasting battery.
-----
Go for it
-----
Everything was per my expectation, awesome battery life, high camera quality ,and fingerprint reader, it's far far better than my previous  phones , I recommend it ,

-----
Awesome experience
-----
Super device.. Im totally happy with this device. I was previously using a xiomi headset, when I started using Samsung m31 it was totally a great experience with samsung super amoled display and one ui 2.0
The battery is really a mega monster which lasts for more than 1 and half to two day.
-----
Amazing long lasting  Samsung M31
-----
Happy with the battery life..need not have to recharge  at least for one full day...Fingerprint is also good...if it was given in front like earlier M Series  would  have been  nice. From weight wise I see little  uncomfortable  holding  for long time but that should  be ok with the given pros..
-----
Not upto the Samsung Standard phone
-----
Back cover is not fully fitted...there is some air  puff nearby finger sensor, creating  doubts if the Battery  is fitted properly or not.
Sometimes  facing the heating  problem as well...one item (pin to open sim Tray) was missing in the box.
-----

I made a good choice by choosing this handset.

The handset is amazing with a sleek body and an amazing display. The camera quality and battery life is fantastic. I am actually enjoying a lot with my phone. Superb handset. Just that samsung should also start providing a back cover and tempered or earphones along with the handset.

Initial review after 1st week usage
-----
I have been using the phone for a week now. The battery and camera has been superb till now.  The response time of the screen is incredibly fast. The wifi calling feature also works fine for me.

I have not come across any cons as of now. But will post again if i see any.
-----
Worst experience
-----
Phone gets hanged , u can best notice it while using  WhatsApp and u type faster .

Other phone like oneplus didny face such issues..not worth switching to Samsung
-----
Fast charging getting late
-----
Camera is good. Battery while using internet 1 day only withstand. And fast charging takes 2:30 hrs to full. While charging and internet using time near back camera heating.

I love the camera quality.first i was thinking to buy a mi phone but i was little worried about battery and then i see this amazing phone in this price range. Ram is 6gb so pubg runs very smoothly. Thanks Samsung for this amazing phone.

I am giving this review after using 10days. Fingerprint sensor should give on screen and back camera quality is not so good. Its taking more than 3hrs to full charge in this mobile, but mentioned its fast charging phone. I am very certisfied with battery life as its giving almost 2days backup.

I was using samsung mobile almost 5-7 years ago and samsung m31 is best it's battery drop so slowly so I can play pubg many hours whereas  on other devices battery drop very rapidly I am very happy about my choice that I buy samsung m31 and its display,camera and overall performance is amazing
-----
Samsung M31 is overheated phone and camera is not good
-----
I got the phone yesterday. When i switched kn the phone it is overheated. When i call order for an replacement they said that they wouldn't replace the phone. The camera quality is not good .The images are blurrying. Due to overheating i cant kept the phone in my hand. Overheating is the main problem
-----
Awesome battery life üòâ
-----
Finger print is really good but face unlock s not that as I was using vivo v9. Face unlock needs to b improve. Battery is good, I usually use bluetooth and get a lot of calls the whole day, this device gives me a freedom from charging it again and again. No words to Express about the battery.
-----
Samsung M31 - A complete package!
-----
I am always a fan of good camera and I am really happy that I purchased it as soon as it went live. This phone is a complete package with good camera quality, sufficent space and good batery life, apps runs smoothly, suitable for social media lovers and many good features. Highly recommended.
-----
Iron box worth 16K..!
-----
Get very hot while making call. Having Battery drain problem. Get 100% to 0 in 14 hours in idle mode, and maximum of 4 hours when normal use. Face unlock not work properly. You can add 3 finger prints at maximum
Main Camera is OK. 32mp front cam also good. But Macro only deserves 1 star.
-----
Worth buying
-----
One of the best phone I have ever used.
Camera quality is wonderful and battery is monster one with 6000 mh. Display is pretty much good in sun light too...6GB RAM gives u no lag...Complete package of all that matters for a phone.
-----
Awesome  and magnificent M31
-----
Purchased on the very first day...Fabulous and unique in this budget range.
Awesome  display
Magnificent camera quality
Long battery duration
Smooth operation
No other company can match the performance of this phone in this budget range
I am enjoying  Samsung M31
-----
As the name suggests  "MONSTER"  M31 deserves it
-----
1.Thumbs up for Audio,display,battery,camera for this segment(if you are a normal user then go for it¬π
2.Gaming performance  is also ok not so bad (whether you a heavy gamer this phone is for u)
3.I feel night sight of camera is noisy (Hope Samsung will resolve this on next update)

Awesome price range 15k
-----
Every thing is fine n superb.  I could say that the mobile is excellent at the price of around 15000. Small issue - when your mobile heats I.e., gaming or in charging.  Mobile finger print sensor could not recognize your finger print.  Later it works when it cools down.
-----
Faulty
-----
Faulty product was received I m very upset. They are delivering product without
T any check or test. Wastage of time, money and dissatisfaction. No return option is there.

Perfect review

Worst performance...too much lag
Display is good and battery and camera is ok
-----
Awesome
-----
Superb Amoled Screen in mid range. Fingerprint is really responsive, camera quality is really good and battery life last about 36hours. Overall excellent phone in this price range.
-----
Good phone but few technical hitches need to improve
-----
After using nearly 2 months Every thing is worthy in this product including processing speed, camera, screen clarity, battery life etc.

But while WhatsApp video call 2 out of 5 time it over heats. And calls disconnects.

And every 7 -10 days it hangs and restarts itself
-----
Loved it
-----
Everything about this mobile is perfect...battery quality, camera, processing, features...everything is just wowwwww.....there is my favorite feature is available...night mode.....must buy this one ...in 16k it is so damn good...you'll love it...thanks to my friend who recommended it...ü•∞ü•∞

Dead phone by samsung
-----
The phone stopped working after an patch update by samsung. The worst ever response from the samsung customer care. All users of M31 were affected badly those who have done change to their old phone. Don't buy this model , if samsung outlet is not near you. Don't even think to gift someone.
-----
Go for it if you're not an avid gamer
-----
Huge Battery
I got 6hrs screen on time and still had 62% remaining.
The viewing angles are good.
Gaming is average and it can be expected in this price range.
Pubg defaults to HD and high. And HDR Ultra is also working but HD and High give better graphics and rendering..
-----
Samsung comes with Joke Processors
-----
I installed a system update from Samsung and now the phone is not starting. Never buy Samsung devices as they are coming with very poor processor. I am having an internship to do and in this time of lockdown I cannot reach the service center also. To hell with Samsung. Never gonna buy this.

Amazing phone. Best parts are its design, camera and display  . Performance is best in this price group . You cannot compare it with anyone. It's such a beast .only one thing charger is lil bit slow to charge such a huge battery.  Weight distribution of phone is pretty cool no one can imagine.

Samsung M31 review
-----
Pros:
I'm using from last week,
Camera is amazing, really good picture quality even you can click in night light even moon.
Fast processor, very handy in order to screen size.
Strong 6000mah battery it drains in one and half day.
Cons: Not as such I found still now
-----
Mach-31_Monster
-----
I have used samsung for the first time. Looks pretty decent in operation. Good features and would expect more to be added in new updates just as in A or S series.
Overall worth it.

Issues : phone restart  automatically ise unable to connect bluetooth  with my pc.
-----
M31 review after 15 days of use.
-----
By look product is beautiful. Battery life is not as per 6000mAh and can not see 6GB ram performance.
2 years old 5000mAh battery of my mobile gives better performance than this 6000mAh.
Product has lot of things but doesn't deserve for this much of cost.
-----
Awesome device!!!
-----
Very happy with this devices especially with the battery life it last almost 2 days, camera could have been better. The screen is awesome like most of the Samsung devices it's very bright and colour full and ideal for outdoor usage. As conclusion it is good device.
-----
Smart and effective .
-----
Has a pleasing look .
Easy to operate. Multiple capabilities for communication, internet operations and realtime information sharing .
It's camera and video capabilities are effective and easy to use.
Provides multiple capabilities in the real fast moving world.
-----
Superb Battery phone
-----
Looking smart. Finger print scanner is comfortable for us. The processor is powerful. The camera is working good in low light condition.The main highlight is battery. This is the power bank. Just consumed 13 percent battery when I saw a two and half hour movie. Finally it is a affordable.

No back cover in box
-----
Average phone
-----
Fingerprint reader is average compare to another mobiles in market. Camera quality is not good as per mention 64 mp, that's big negative point in this mobile.
Only a good point for this handset is battery, it's a complete power pack for 2 days for normal use.
-----
My new Samsung M31 "monster"
-----
Best thing what i liked in this phone is the battery life. Its 'monster'. Camera is good but samsung need to give an update so the camera software is upgraded for more stability and camera superiority. Built quality is also good and phone is best value for every single rupee.
-----
Stay Away from samsumg Mseries phones
-----
It has network problem.
Only sim in slot 1 have been working properly.
I think entire m series having network problem.
Please stay away from samsung Mseries phones
-----
Poor Quality phone
-----
Poor camera.... so heavy ... Very Poor both Front and Rear camera...
Bad service Amazon.. not return policy.. Both Samsung and Amazon disappointed me a lot.. waste of money.
-----
Restarts whenever  it wants to.
-----
As expected  of a samsung phone. Hangs a lot.  The phone restarts on it's  own for no reason.
The phone is frustrating as every other app I open faces an issue and closes down (leave games, no luck).

 Cheap and rightly  so, bad quality.
-----
The Battery  Beast
-----
The best phone in this price range!!!
It's almost 2 days I haven't  charged my phone.
Great battery life and reception is great and most importantly which I am fan about it's super AmoLED display which only Samsung  provide in this price range. I'm also loving it's  one UI 2.0.

Yesterday bought this product, but it charges very slowly i.e. 30% / hour whereas other m31 charges at 40% / hour (Youtube reviews), dont know whether it software or hardware issue.

I am using Samsung J8 since its launch. So when I have to gift one mobile to my son there was no choice but to go for Samsung M31. It looks stunning and camera is excellent. Powerful battery and storage.

The camera quality which is mention that 64mp for rare and 32 mp for selfie is very bad, it is like 8mp and thay too or Redmi camera quality, and selfie pixel is tearing after taking the pictures, disappointed with camera quality, Samsung did not provided what it has told,,,!!! üëéüëéüëéüëé
-----
Not worth buying it
-----
It's been just one month i am not at all happy with the product.. Facing problems  with wifi, sound and front camera not so clear it's blur... I dont know whether it is only in this one  problem or not so I am ready to replace it or sell it
-----
Excellent product
-----
Value for money phone...with so many brands which got famous over night ... oldies still hold good and their R&amp;D investment still give good and excellent products... really happy that I did not go for one of those and choose Samsung above all. A big thumbs up for Samsung M31
-----
Camera
-----
Poor Camera collection, we can not click 30% pic quality as seen in his promo, Don't buy this for Camera, battery is good but take too much time to charge,Night mode is very bad
-----
Don't Buy
-----
Worst product of Samsung i have ever got , within one month of purchase product got crashed while updating.  Since this has happened during lockdown i can't get it repaired and have to wait until service centers are opened.
I don't recommend to buy this product at all.

Quality Product.

Awesome battery (6000mAh)first of all.It lasted for more than 2 days.
Camera quality is so good that the number on the car plate can be seen  after taking the pic from 4th floor.
I am fully satisfied by this product from Samsung at this price.

Loved it.

CHEATING WASTE OF YOUR HEARD EARNED MONEY

Review of Galaxy M31
-----
I also have a M30. It has a  problem with video  camera. While  recording videos the brightness changes periodically on its own without  any change in external  circumstances. I am glad to say that this problem is not there in Galaxy M31. Other features of this phone M31 are excellent.
-----
Too slow charging with the supplied charger.
-----
It seems okay - performance wise. But charging is slow. Samsung gave a 10W charger only eventhough the phone supports 15W charging. This is pointless savings - probably trying to sell of their old 10w chargers.
-----
Honestly mega phone
-----
Overall phone is damn good..! As stated mega battery, good camera and display.

I only hope future updates increases the zooming capacity.

Thank you Amazon for the phone and Thank you Samsung for this wonderful device.
-----
Don't buy. Useless product
-----
Completely worst product.never expect from samsung.touch,sound , display and software all over worst products.
This experience is after 2 month use.
Honest review.
Plz don't buy.

The best budget phone ever given by Samsung.
-----
The phone's  performance  is very good. Battery  life is awsm, but need to improve a little in the selfie camera. Face recognition  is  a little  slow. Rest of the all other features  are mond blowing. The phone is very comfortable  to use. The best budget  phone ever given by Samsung üëç
-----
Dont buy samsung Galaxy M31
-----
This is the worst product which I have bought from amazon team.

I would request you to take away this mobile phone piece

And refund my money to my added account in the amazon app.

I will be thankful to the team if you action upon the same said as above.
-----
For Samsung lover. Not great phone but ok

-----
Good and Value for money

Over all, the phone is more than good.
Fingerprint reader is sticky and sometimes it's not working.  Face lock works good.
Camera quality is good as expected.
Battery life is good enough to stay 1.5 day with moderate usage.
-----
Very poor picture quality..don't purchase
-----
Camera specification are great 64 &amp; 32 but picture quality very very poor ...... Launched with out validation

Making fool to customers by giving such specifications

Wonderful camera and display üñ§.

BAD PERFORMANCE BATTERY
-----
Battery Performance is very bad.
not a 6000mah only 2500mah Performance.
-----
Battery beast &amp; best for multimedia consumption.
-----
Best battery life, of all the phones I used.
Even with a huge 6000 mah battery, in hand it feels lighter than a 5000 mah battery phone.

Camera is good.
Display quality is quite good.

Over all it's worth it, best for multimedia consumption.
-----
An happy and satisfied customer
-----
Been just a week since buying the mobile and loving it. Glad to have made right choice. The battery lasts 2 full days if you don't watch too much online videos or play games. Previous phone with limited usage too had bad battery backup. I'm an happy customer.
-----
This phone is really good.
-----
Samsung phones are best . And I just bought M31 and it is an amazing phone  with amazing cameras and we can't judge about battery as it is 6000Mah . And it's look is oh my god.And one more important thing that it has wifi calling. Overall it is a good phone and in budget also.üëåüëåüëå
-----
Master piece
-----
Power pack Battery with minimum of 1&amp; 1/2 day with  internet on all the time...yupp u heard it right....with impressive super amoled display with not much impressive camera...but it's still ok... With  6gb ram &amp; 128gb memory is awesome at its price.....so overall my rating is 4.25/5
-----
Samsung M 31 is very good product to use
-----
*Open and close the notification panel using the fingerprint reader is very advanced future and it is very useful to use.
*Back camera clarity is good but front camera Little Red shadow so update the front camera to use .
*battery life is very good.
-----
Don't buy this model
-----
Phone frequently heating while in call and in using data..call is not clear in certain times.poor data
Very worst product don't buy this phone
-----

Amazingly, a complete mobile phone
-----
This phone has very decent battery life
AND great camera quality.  I can take very lively pictures using this. The fingerprint censor is as smooth as butter. And very smooth operating capabilities. Really impressed. No device warm issues compared to earlier models.
-----
Best of both worlds
-----
Screen looks and feels like high-end smartphone and as advertised the battery backup is upto top noch. Little bit of performance issue after the update but I'm sure samsung will fix it after the next update.
-----
camera quality
-----
Awesome mobile with budget price ,good quality,best camera,best display,wonderful battery,totally Samsung is very good... I love Amazon.... Best budget mobile in 2020...
-----
It's a beautiful Beast.
-----
Samsung is the big thing and will remain a big thing. I mean the smartphone is like 8th wonder of the world to me. It's like a small brother, remains everytime and everywhere with me. I also named it "Samsu". Its love. And the battery in it is a beast. Thank you samsung for creating this beast.
-----
Cheap product
-----
Cheap camera front looks more like 5mp back looks more like 12mp, has heating issue even without heavy use. My redmi note 5pro is even better than this phone. There could have been at least a silicon cover like the other phones in this budget. 2 star is even too much for this phone
-----
Nice phone but processor could have been better
-----
The processor is slow. Even with 6 gigs of ram u would have trouble sometimes. It seems apps are not optimised for the screen. Daylight pics are amazing but night shots are dull.battery is good about 9-10 hrs of on screen time...display is crisp and amazing. User interface is good.
-----
Camera quality &amp; SD card problem
-----
Camera quality is poor and SD card is unreadable even SD card is inserted in phone..
-----
Auwsome product..
-----
Beautiful colour, smooth handling, easy to understand the functions and the most important thing is it's in our budget...one thing I don't like it that inbuild  battery and the steel pin for to insert sim cards &amp; memory card... they didn't give headphones with mobile, you have to buy.
-----
Heating heating heating ... also pooor manufacturing . Check out  camera alignment
-----
Honest reviews
Rear camera : good
Front camera: worst ever

Awesome Handy phone with so many features for day to day life in Budget price.
-----
Awesome Handy phone for day to day life use in Budget. Camera is amazing as always from Samsung with natural colors. Wide Angel Camera in a Budget Phone which is seen very rarely in any Brands with such a high Picture quality. I am a fan of Samsung and will be always till I Die :)
-----
Made for me...like many
-----
6000 mAh battery gives excellent performance for regular mobile users.
Camera quality back  64 MP,8MP,5MP,5MP and front 32MP gives superb photogenic images Nd videos too.
Fingerprint reader, which is secured opened in time.
Overall for me its absolutely made for me.
-----
Camera and battery life is amazing
-----
Camera is wayy too good in daylight... and you can take a good picture in night too but with some efforts... slow mo in night doesnt work properly... also in whtsap video calling ...the receiver cnt receive your voice... battery life is amazing you can use it for two days straight
-----
Not good battery it's not more then 3000hm

Afar 3 days use I don't know Where is 6000mh battery it's not working more then 3000mh battery I am not happy with this battery I have transfer my all data on this phone it I send for replace then I loss my all data
-----
Great budget phone
-----
Very good product having a bright screen. Touch and operations are smooth. No heating or lagging problem.
But at the same time disappointed from the rear camera. Not good as one would expect from a 64 MP camera.
-----
Worst in gaming
-----
I bought  m31 4days. The gaming  experience is very  worst. I installed only one game clash of clans. It openings  after throwing 3 to 5 times not responding.  Camera quality  is quite brilliant. Processor is not good enough.  Battery  life  is much better.
-----
Snag

The phone keeps hanging at least once a day and then i need to restart it ...!!! Want a replacement .....it am worse than my old  phone....

-----
Battery life is awesome. About camera quality, I would  say  in day it's good, but in night mode it doesn't  satisfy my expectation. Fingerprint reader is good and it's  fast. About build quality  it feels very solid holding........Overall, worth buying for 16000. Awesome phone!!
-----
Good phone to buy

Samsung m31 is really  good phone to buy. Display- 10/10
Battery - 10/10
Camera- 9/10

For Normal use you can find this phone is really awesome. I am not in gaming too much, so not sure about gaming option. Till now fully satisfied.

Big bigger beast

Simply loved this product from Samsung.
Screen so big and even bigger battery to support my 3 day usage on single charge.
 Had an iPhone earlier and never enjoyed such flexibility like on this phone.
The best part is battery, camera and latest android.

Speaker problem in samsung M31.

I purchased Samsung galaxy M31 phone from amazon one month ago. Now it has a problem in inbuilt speaker. it automatically decrease its volume to approximately 30 percent and stay the same even if i try mx and vlc player. and when i reastart it then it became normal.
-----
Amazon is not reliable just like this phone
-----
This phone is producing heat during call at upper part of the mobile. Camera is not worth. Not worthfull for money.while i was telling the problem they are always trying to convince me that there is not any problem. Actually problem is there. Dont book anything on amazon again.

On the 11th day it got switch off 10 times a automatically without pressing any keys I recommend my all friends not to buy this phone go for redmi or realme as they are cheaper and easy to use for 2-3 years and I am having this shit phone and it is going to make me in trouble.
-----
Very bad front camera
-----
Front camera is very bad... It says 32 m but doest have quality of even 5mp. Very much disappointed... Anyway not going to return bcz I don't have tym to wait for another one and the biggest task is to choose a good phone... But have to say, back camera is amazing
-----
M31 excellent phone at affordable price.  co

I was using note 5 since 3 years . Since past 6 months  battery was discharging fast . M31 has excellent battery . Fingerprint reader is amazing. Camera quality is good.  Cons . Cost cutting measure like short charging wire is causing inconvenience but manageable.
-----
Must buy. Value for money
-----
The fingerprint reader is superfast. The camera quality is just wow. The colourful screen which is super amoled display is very good. The battery life is so good that I played pubg mobile in smooth and extreme settings and played 9 hrs as the battery is of 6000mah

Great budget phone!

My two biggest needs were: a decent camera and a good battery life. M31 delivered on both fronts excellently, offering a whopping 6000 mAh battery life and a four-camera setup that is on par with some of the best you can get. All this for 16k is an absolute steal!

Review After Using One Week Samsung M31
-----
1st time I am using  Samsung brand smartphone..
It is really awesome . Samsung M31 is so good  to use and it amazing mega monster  battery backup also. Camera Photos are really good in day time and I like it . But full charging  it take nearly  3 to 3.30 hours
-----
Silent killer.
-----
It's good quality mobile  from Samsung. Awesome camera,battery but need to improve  little bit in design. Price  should  be 1k less for this model. But overall  it's amazing and is best then redmi,realme and many other in this price  segment. I suggest  go for this.
-----
Best of the Best...
-----
Very nice product, awesome camera,big battery, superb screen Amoled, no lag while playing games, good looking....perfect combo for this price range.
Cons- only 8x zoom, night mode not that effective, use filters for enhancing colors. But go for it product.  Am satisfied.

Camera quality is great but the clicking speed is slow. Battery life is just massive. The fingerprint reader is a bummer at times but good for the price range. Face unlock is the thing that bums me the most about this phone. Otherwise the phone is good overall.

Extraordinary Performance

Average phone
-----
Very poor camera quality, flash is not working with photo mode, only works with live focus, battery life is about 2 days for average user.fingerprint reader is fast.
When photos zoom in, it lacks quality . When taking photos with photo mode cannot zoom in.
-----
Blinfolded buy at 16k
-----
Great features for Heavy Users at an Aggressive Price Point.
Breathtaking display.
Never-ending battery.
Simple interface.
Detailed AI Camera.
Good gestures with Andriod 10.
Go for the 128 GB and it'll easily survive for the next 3 to 5 years.
-----
Third class phone
-----
Very third class mobile...battery is draining continuously...phone is heating too...camera quality is very low..don't but this product becoz Amazon is not ready to return this product as I had purchased it on 16 March 2020..bt not ready to replaced...don't buy this product
-----
Best phone in the range of 15k
-----
Nothing to complain about everything is above notch. P.s I am not a heavy gamer so my gaming experience was normal. Be it camera , display &amp; battery simply awesome and best in the segment. No other company is providing such a great camera and display in this price segment.
-----

Galaxy M31 Review
-----
Camera Quality is mind-blowing. Battery usually takes 2.5 hrs to charge and will easily last for 2 days if you are a normal user. Face recognition lags a little but fingerprint dominates this minimal problem. Display feels so good and dark mode gives an extra spice to it.

Excellent phone
-----
Excellent phone by samsung. I bought 128gb in exchange of moto one power. It is very sleek and light weight. Lightning fast speed. Happy with my new phone.
-----
Killer phone!!!
-----
I am having amazing  experience  with this mega monster. Superb specs, amazing screen and camera. The only thing I need a good cover for this phone from Samsung. It's a killer phone.
-----
Disappointing CAMERA
-----
Battery is Good but Camera quality is very disappointing. My Apple iPhone 7 which has 12MP camera shoots 10 times clear photo than this so called 64MP camera. If u want to buy this phone for camera only, better don't go for it. Rest is fine
-----
Best phone at this price
-----
The camera quality  is very nice and the battery runs almost 2 days if charged 100% once. Best phone at this price
-----
Excellent working and good result good net fiture

-----
Awesome phone by Samsung!
-----
A great product by Samsung! The camera quality is superb and I love how long the battery lasts. The display and the phone features are great too! I definitely recommend this product because of its sleak design and amazing features. Such a great buy at a reasonable price!
-----
Good product
-----
Camera quality is impressive but finger print reader and face recognition could be better. It has good battery life and will last 2 days without charging if you are an average user but if you tend to watch a lot of videos and movies it will last only one day.
-----
Good one..
-----
After using one week my opinion about this fon is
Camera is good but not to good.
Sound quality is osm
Screen is not very wide  its length is more than width
Mobil run smoothly 6 GB ram enough to run very well
Over all rating is 3.5 *
-----
Killer at this price range from samsung
-----
It a best smart phone from Samsung on M series .It has 64 mp main camera.8 mp ultra wide angle camera.5mp depth camera and 5 mp macro camera , 32 mp front camera and exynox 9611 processor for best perfomance
 and a incredible sAmoled display and 15 watt fast charging
-----
Supurb device at this afortable price range.
-----

-----
Perfect phone according to my needs
-----
i have been using this phone for 3 months i am absolutely satisfied withthis phone But if you are looking for a gaming phone this is the perfect phone but you will get little disappointment in pubg gaming expierence.
-----
I am in love with this beast.
-----
This product is amazing at its price.
The camera quality is amazing as I have tried with multiple modes.
Also this mobile is a battery beast with 6000mah..
Also the speed is very smooth.
The Samsung UI is very user friendly and attractive.
-----
64 mp pixel is like 32 mp Samsung  cheats  us
-----
Money regarding phone is not good .like 64 mp of camera is only for telling.battery is good but not working whole day .there is no gorilla protection it's only for writing.if we want to see full gorilla protection then buy Nokia 7.2 is good and 48 mp camera is better than 64 mp
-----
Great phone go for it.
-----
3 days since I got the new M31.
Display 9/10
Camera 7 / 10..wish we see more improvement.
Speed 8/10 for day today use. I am not in to gaming so dont know how it will with gaming.
Overall bery good phone for all basic activities.
-----
Camera not as advertised
-----
Bought the phone for its camera. Isnt what the company says. Rest everything is good.
-----
Amazing
-----
From an allround perspective this is a beauty in all its functions and features offered. But I felt a little draining of battery when watched videos for long hours.  Anyways its preferable choice for a normal user, who is not obsessed with gaming.
-----
MegaMonster
-----
Really a good buy, amazing battery back up and very happy with the performance, camera and everything else on the phone.  Worth a buy and lot of my friends are planning to switch to Samsung instead of Xiaomi or other phones in the similar lineups.
-----
Simply WoW!!!
-----
The Best Phone in this category. I am satisfied with its performance. Excellent picture quality and awesome battery life.
-----
Average performance
-----
Not a very good phone.....phone heats up very much even in normal use....worst camera ...only good thing about phone is Amoled screen....
-----
Cool.
-----
Awesome  mobile for a best price. Original  product only available  in amazon. Its camera is best for those who knows how to take a photo. Only lag is it is bit weight considering  it's mammoth 6000mah battery samsung has done a pretty amazing job. Overall it's awesome.
-----

Affordable and worth for price!
-----
I got a faulty product when I placed the first time. I contacted the Amazon customer care and they were really helpful and replaced my product in 3 days.I am happy with this purchase,it is affordable and worth it. Camera is good and samoled display feels so good on eyes
-----
Overall a good phone at this price range
-----
Pros:
Battery backup is good
Amazing display
Processor is fine
Good camera quality
Good user interface
Cons:
Macro and night mode of the camera should  have been better
It takes longer period for charging since it is a 15W charger
-----
Poor Battery performance
-----
Phone gets overheated on charging,  it takes three hours to get full charge, battery  life is also less, I was using M20 and M30, but M31 is not as good as M20 or M30, disappointed,  I was using Samsung  mobile phones since so many years,  this unit really  disappointed
-----
All rounder good phone with lowest sar value
-----
Oneui is good
Battery backup super
Camera is also good
Lowest sar value in this 15k budget
Good for low and mid gaming
Sure not for high end games
Prone to scratch on back best to buy case
Fingerprint and face unlock is very fast
-----
You will also regret buying this phone.... Don't buy this phone even in your in dreams
-----
The phone keeps on hanging and automatically gets switched off. I have faced this problem thrice with 7 days of purchasing it. Samsung phones under 20k are worst. Average battery average look and it is a bit thick in terms of dimension. I regret buying this.
-----
Excellent  phone beyond  my expectations
-----
I am using  this phone about for one week now it is more worth than your money
Battery life is super I am getting  more than 2 days
Camara is extremely super
Over all phone performance is excellent
Thanks  for Amazon's in on time delivery
-----
Camera is not upto the mark.. rest all good..thanks
-----
Camera quality is very poor, other than that mobile is good... If your looking for great camera quality mobile please don't go for it otherwise you can opt for it.. I wanted to return it please let me know if I can return or exchange to other mobile.. thanks
-----
Over all its very good .
-----
Its very good product camera quality is osm good speed and perfomence  are good . Prise is very reasonable .tuch pad very smooth  i like . But only one problem i feel that when low lite the slow motion camera lite flickering.
-----
Very satisfied with the product
-----
Extremely happy with the product. This is really a very all rounder phone at a very attractive price point and is feature-rich. The battery back up is great and camera quality is very good for a normal user like me.
-----
Best battery life.
-----
Pros:
Best battery life
Screen quality
Camera
Looks

Cons:
Heats after playing 1 hours of continous gaming.

Overall best phone in this price range with samsung branding.
-----
¬© 1996-2020, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates
-----
its processor is very good and less lag
-----
The best things I found in this phone is its battery life and process which lag less and the thing which I dislike is its front camera and company is not providing any tempered glass, earphone and back cover with phone which other companies generally provided with phone.
-----
Below average.
-----
Good points : battery, camera, look, touch screen.
Bad points: doesn't catch the network properly.
Speaker quality not very good.

So its disappointing.
There are better handsets in Samsung itself n others like oppo n vivo.
-----
Very good phone. Value for money
-----
Soft touch, responsive. Good battery life. other phone which i am using is Note 10 plus.
For routine use I don't find any difference.
Must have
-----
Great Value for money with good display and camera
-----
Great phone , value for money, could have provided  glass back instead of polycarbonate,  but still phone looks premium.
Battery life comes around 1.5 days with above average usage.
Slightly feeling hot in the back near camera area during high internet usage.
-----
Superb Display and Long Battery Life
-----
In past I have used almost all brands like MI, OPPO, VIVO etc.
First time I am using Samsung Brand M31 (Indian Brand)

My Reason to buy Samsung M31 as below :
1) Super AMOLED Display
2) 6000 mAh battery (2 Days Life)
3) 32 MP Selfie Camera
-----
Good phone for a normal day to day use
-----
Awesome product.  Using a Samsung mobile for the first time. Ultimate battery. Buy a good back case(spigen was best). Camera is also good. For a normal day to day use the phone is more than super. As of now I don't repent my decision to buy this.
-----
Really awesome product, go for it
-----
The name monster is absolutely set for it, because of its 6000mah battery, it lasts for very long time.
Its AMOLED display  makes me lines it very much, smooth touch
Camera is superb
Finger print is very sensitive
Overall awesome product
-----
Best phone in this price range
-----

-----
Very bad experience because I have seen software upgrades and when I have done then my phone is not working
-----

One of the best phone
-----
Awesome phone,battery life of this phone is too god,fingerprint sensor of this is too fast to open lockscreen.i think samsung 531 is one of the good phones of samsung M series and i suggest this phone to my friens circle and trying to make the M series friends's group.

Samsung M31 Review
-----
Excellent Battery and  Amoled display with black theme , triple slots is impressive while ita average finger print sensor bit takes time and the positon is bit upside which confuses with Camera lens.Overall value for money.
-----
Good phone
-----
Excellent product. In this mobile camera slow motion videos are very cool in day light, it feels difficulty in night light or any artificial light. Also 6gb ram is very smooth and faster with decent processor at this price.
-----
Network Problem with this Phone
-----
It's the worst phone, I ever used or purchased. This phone has a network problem although we are close to network area but still has a very bad network.

I'm calling Amazon customer care from last 5 days in this regards but of no-use !
-----
Best in price
-----
Camera was awesome
Macro camera was not so much good.
Material was good.
Processor was not so good.
Its hanging on first day
Front camera was awesome
Earphone was not included that's not good
Charger was fast.
-----
Fantastic
-----
Display is superb and feels really smooth to touch the screen. One UI and Android 10 is an added advantage. Battery life is good and the speaker is decent. Wish they had given a transparent cover and earphones. Overall a really good experience.

-----
Samsung nailed it like a boss!
-----
Awesome! Powerful phone with amazing features. Battery doesn't look as powerful as I was expecting but no worries. My expectations were way too high as well. Another thing is hanging when using whatsapp keypad. Happened a few times but just with WhatsApp.

Probably this might be a faulty piece , cuz my friend owns same device  , but it doesn't seem to have these many problems,
1)Phone heats up
2) Speaker sound  flicks
3) screen sensitivity extreme level a bezels
4)most apps crash back to homescreen
-----
Fantastic buy!
-----
This is a fantastic  phone I have ever used, with all the features performing beyond expectations.

Initially, when I unboxed the phone and started using it, it was slow. But within hours it took off well, and delivers extreme performance. Value for Money!

-----
I really love this device as it got everything great such  as Amazing Super Amoled display, Ultimate Camera quality both front and back, battery backup, Ram management, gaming ad well. It is fully packed with features. This device is answer to every problem of mine.
-----
Well samsung galaxy m31 is a recent best phone in terms of specs power and battery
-----
The pingerprint sensor of thephone is pretty fast but can be improved by putting it on the power button
Camera wise samsung has always been doing a awesome job no doubt on it
And the huge battery of 6000mah give this monster a boost while gaming activities
-----
Go for it
-----
Fingerprint reader is working smooth.
Camera quality is also very good as this also provide wide view click.
Battery life is enough as you can play PUBG without any interruptions.
Face lock also work in low light .
Game booster is also available.
-----
Immetur April Software Update. Phone is useless if you update
-----
Immetur April Software update. After software installation my phone restarting  it's show software fail. Even not open after using volume down key and power button. I never saw such a worst software update which makes phone useless.
-----
Awesome phone. Headphone Jack problem.
-----
Camera, display and battery are awesome.  My only concern is that,  headphone Jack is too tight. I'm not sure whether this is only with my unit,  but it becomes difficult to put and pull the headphone Jack. The same headphone is all good with my Nokia 6.
-----
#MONSTER#
-----
Best product around 14k-15k..the only con is its built quality  as it looks and feels old and classical style...otherwise  no other prblm faced uptill now..
One advice to all who are going  for this product  is that they  should  take care of its back and screen...

The phone is an excellent option if you travel a lot and need your phone's charge to last long.  The cameras excellent in good light though it struggles tiny little bit in low light.

The phone is quite fast in unlocking the phone with fingerprint reader.
-----
M31 MegaMonsterüíî
-----
Everything thing is fine but  rear  camera is not up to the mark....its not at all 64mp camera, and u should have provided at least 27 W charger for quick charging 15 W charger takes 3 hrs for full charging....other than that M31 is not bad in this price range ..‚ô•Ô∏è
-----
Very bad quality phone
-----
This phone has cheap plastic quality. Even looks like a second hand phone just after using a week. Gets heat too much after some time and the camera is a bad one neve gets focus. Worthless for such a huge amount. I will never buy any phone from Samsung.

Best phone from samsung in all parameters like finger print work very well, camera quality is awesome and battery life will easily get for 36hrs after heavy usage
-----
Must to have such a Monster
-----
It is real Mega Monster. Battery lasts for more than a day, quick recharge is amazing. Camera pics are EXCELLENT. In my opinion finger print reader is needs little more improvement. Overall a GREAT phones with all these features, a best value for money.
-----
Just ok mobile.
-----
Overall performance is ok. Camera is not as per expectations. Charging is slow compared to 6000 mah battery. No inbuilt app lock. Light weight phone. RAM management is good. Not as good as oppo phones. Better to go for poco or realme if you have approx 15k budget.
-----
Awesome experience with galaxy  M31.
-----
I got delivered it on Friday...i am using it since two days ...i found no issue in usage , Camera quality is superb , battery backup is awesome , awesome reading experience  during the travel as display  is superb , over all value for money ...even more than that.

It's a great phone
Pros: 1&gt;the battery  last for 1-1/2 to 2 days on single charge.
2&gt; Display is vibrant  with amazing black levels
3&gt; camera is awesome
4&gt; The Dolby atmos mode provides 3d effects.
Cons : gets little bit warm on heavy use.
-----
Samsung m31 was not bad but price is too high
-----
I'm using samsung galaxy m31 mobile was ok.But 15999 price is too high....oNly mobile and charger there providing... No earphone,temperd,backcase... 6000mah will coming 1&amp;1/2 day.. 14000 is the best price to mobile..and there are not providing any cash back offers
-----
Excellent In Budget
-----
Excellent phone in budget everything is perfect in this phone recommended to everyone who's looking for a stunning camera, smooth performance, perfect amoled display &amp; massive battery that can run more than 2 days, Just Go for it.
-----
Over all great mobile in current price range
-----
Many features are awesome like camera quality, gestures for screenshot, atmos Dolby for headphones, battery life, focus mode, Bixby feature, super slow-mo and others.

Only thing that needs improvement is face unlock. It can be made flawless and faster.
-----
Some dislikes otherwise good phone
-----
It has some defects as sometimes it doesn't autocut the charge after 100% it keeps on charging. Sometimes fingerprint sensor doesnot work or very slow to function. I have experienced lag and hang problem 2 times till now. Snapchat front camera is very zoomed in .
-----
Dont buy this phone M31
-----
Dont buy this phone M31 because singnal strenth is very poor when i was use the same sim card to another phone signal showing 4/4 and in M31 Showing 1/4.
Hotspot not working fine.
When playing game like pubg lot of issues.
Worst product by samsung.

Excellent phone
-----
The volume is quite low,both stereo and call, but the screen, operating system,camera modes and quality ,and handset size is excellent. Kudos to the Samsung team for providing an excellent phone at  a reasonable price!!
-----
This is brackage product
-----
Samsung M31 is good, Camara Quality also good, Battery performance is outstanding, features of the phone also attractive, Dual app facility not available except WhatsApp.
-----
Great Product
-----
In the images that i have seen in the internet I thought the phone is ok but when I had the phone in my hand it's really different. Design is prerty good, it feels very compact. Overall gaming, photography and display are awesome
-----
Worst phone ...
-----
One of the worst phone I hv ever used ... within 20 days display doesn't work on perticular spot. Phone often stuck or hang ....
Takes too much time to charge because battry is 6000mah but charger is 9v .... not satisfied...
-----
Just what you would wish to have
-----
The battery and camera are just superb when it comes to the phone of this budget. The battery being 6000mah and still being light weight was just unimaginable. A great overall performance including fingerprint sensor,processor and the display is just phenomenal.
-----
Budget rang King from Samsung
-----
Truley Samsung's Best Budget range phone.
Massive Battery Capasity,with awesome Camara facility , and out standing Display.
Processor is far enough for my Need.
After two week of my use i truly recommend this phone for streamers and travel Lovers.
-----
Supersonic Smartphone
-----
Superb performance. Not only Battery Life or Camera but the overall ease of use. Amazing processing, ergonomics, aesthetics. You name it and M31 proves it's excellence. It's a 5th generation fighter jet amongst rest all vintage subsonics in the smartphone world.
-----
Blue megamonster will make them jealous.

HIGH END GAME IS RUNNING SMOOTH.

I PREFER BUYING SAMSUNG ONLY THIS IS ONE IS THE BEST WITH THIS RANGE
-----
Best at this price because i love camera and screen...
-----
6000 Mah battery is sufficient for one day only not for 2 days...
And face unlocking system could not even detect my face and took a bit slower...
And system is hanging even when, i was playing candy crush...

Good Mobile phone but not charger
-----
Everything in this mobile is excellent. But the charger quality is not good. The charger pin is not fitting properly and will not charge properly. I suggest company to provide a good quality charger.
-----
Not recommended to buy
-----
1.Battery taking 3hours to fully charge
2.front camera not even giving 2mp camera clarity
3.Cameravideo clarity is very poor
4.heating  problem
-----

Very good mobile. Battery is long lasting. Rear Camera quality is very good. Selfi camera could have been better  .. worth our money.

Monster is battery for sure
-----
Camera quality is not so good..so kindly dont think for the camera and prefer this mobile..but surely mega monster in battery..gaming and fingerprint sensor is so good...worth for the budget mobile..

Samsung galaxy m31
-----
Display is bright and as there is 1UI so there are lot of additional features. Camera is is also very good.in fact most of the features are good.
Only problem is face reader unlock is slow
Overall the mobile is one of the best in mid range smartphones
-----
Superb phone under 10-16k budget ‚ù§‚ù§
-----
Excellent product with superb Amoled display‚ù§‚ù§ .....
Good camera quality best in taking snaps during day light and the front camera is just superbüòç
Good fingerprint reader
Battery life is of 1 day period . However it depends on the usage .......
-----
Best phone in this budget. (Better than any MI)
-----
Amazing performance throughout considering the price. Camera performance good in daylight, not much in artificial or night light.
Tremendous battery life.
Plus, Amoled display is underrated, the screen on this phone is a delight to look at. Beautiful.
-----
Best display in the market at this price..
-----
Great mobile for regular user, provide great specs over the price range. Using it from the past 2 weeks and no issues yet. Beautiful display and over the top battery life. Chipset could have been better for gaming enthusiasts but for me its a wholesome deal....

Worst product Samsung m31
-----
There is no rating for this product.  One of the worst product . Lots of issue related to software .there is mic , speaker all type of issue in this phone. AMAZON you will loose your brand value if you sell this type of product.
-----
Battery Good, Charging OK, Camera OK
-----
Battery life is good...can be used continuously for 24 hrs but fast charging is not as good as expected...took 2.5 hrs to 3 hrs for full charge from 0%...camera is also good
-----
Not worth the money...
-----
Camera not upto the mark... m30s camera is better when compared  to this... auto focus problem...
-----
8/10 phone and price is reasonable.
-----
I liked the rear camera and body of the phone.
Front camera can be more better and natural.
The battery life is good  and can be more better when it comes to fast charging.
Fingerprint reader is very good but the feel to touch can be more better.
-----
All Ok..
-----
It's A Osm Divice But Only One Thing Missing In This Divice Which Is ScreenShot. I Did't Find At Screen.ScreenShot Is Only Available The Lock or Lower Volume Keys..So That Is Only Thing...But No Prob..I Managed. I Love SAMSUNG In All Product Like TV,Fridge..‚ù§‚ù£
-----
Just Awesome in That Sagment
-----
i like it most...
The battery life is extended our Entertainment..
Camera is also fantastic
And all over basis
I like the phone as well as my new family member..
Just money worthful...
Thank you Samsung...

Awesome mobile phone with over loaded technologies
-----
I am using this phone more than one weeks, it was very adopted and easy to handle with good features. Awesome camera with more options. Also with good fingerprint reader. Regarding the battery life is normal only. Overall super phone with this price and worth.
-----
Phone awesome ..Except camera
-----
Phone display is looking nice and battery backup also superb ..But most expected one the camera function is average..Disappointing a lot...Particularly 32mp selfie camera is pathetic ....Even the 5mp front camera is good in redmi mobiles
-----
Pro and concs one good review all u know about it

Superb cam and battery life
But sensor is bit slow
Play pubg 7 matches to losse battery by 50 percent it can handle at good no drop of fps
Superb depth sensor nice edge detection

face unlock is above average

-----
phone was great but...
-----
phone was great but only one thing unusual was it had a call log dated back on 5th of feb though the fon was launched on 5th march....it seemed unusual as someone might have used it earlier...after talking to customer care they themselve put it for return....
-----
Third Class product from Samsung
-----
Hi All, please don't buy this phone one of the third class quality product from Samsung. Camera not even 16 MP quality and company mentioned 64 MP. You can shoot video at the time of evening or night.
Battery life also very bad I think not even 2000 MAH.
-----
Great Product
-----
Great product.Long battery life, can be used whole day after a single charge.
-----

If you're not a gamer,it's the best for you
-----
Phone is good for normal users like me
Not recommend for those who play heavy games
Battery backup is good
One UI 2.0 is gorgeous.... looks so premium
Camera is nice
No words to describe beauty of this phone and its screen
-----
Budget friendly
-----
Everything is perfect except 3 things...
It is not fast charging...full charge takes more than 2 hours. Then the wide camera quality is low than I expected. Then keyboard getting stuck sometimes. Otherwise it is awesome.
-----
Battery
-----
Battery Life is good and withstanding good after screening continuously for two hours.
Really worry is about the touch screen response time is very slow
-----
Mega monster device is very helpful regarding battery
-----
Actually the Battey work as the nickname given the megamonster, device design , look, features, display..all are great.

But the device is some time getting slow during operation.

Good upgrade in m31 then in m30s.
Overall very good.
-----
Charging speed aweful
-----
Everything is fine battery life is good but charging speed is awful...at first month it took 150 min. To full charge which is now more than 210 minutes... then what is the point of 6000 mah battery while you have to charge it for so..long.....so.....long....
-----
Nyce products Samsung m31
-----
I am fully Satisfied...
-----
Amazing Battery performance... After full day use with WhatsApp Facebook and calling 64% battery was left in the evening... No doubt camera is awesome... Processor speed is pretty good and 6gb Ram with 128 GB internal is more than enough for advance users...
-----
Worst camera
-----
Worst camera, front and rear. Quality is very poor. Not recommended.
-----
Best Mobile
-----
Many software glitches
-----
Waste of money.
It has software glitches.
I am not audible during calls.
Battery takes 3 hours to charge.
Gets drained in less than 24 hours.
Clarity of 64MP is not up to the mark when compared with other 64MP.

Worst phone in 15K | Hangs up always
-----
The new phone hangs most of the times and get stucked. With the 6GB RAM, the phone is worst to use.
The dial screen hangs up always, you will dial but number will not show. You will end the call but it would be active.
Pathetic phone in price of 15k
-----
Wonderful mobile for ever

So far I am Samsung regular customer...but this time I am fully satisfied with this galaxym31.verygood camera quality....enjoyed with sound quality ..battery backup awesome..fingerprint sensor also excellent.....totally super..super..super

Value for money

Samsung m31 128 gb is a value for money. Look wise black color is very simple and not very attractive but phone features cover up it all.

flamboyant phone,
-----
Omg what a Phone, can't believe it's feature in such price, value for money, everything is perfect, like awesome camra ,Monsters battery ,cool display, etc.

Elegant look and works smoothly!
-----
I bought the 6gb Ram 128gb variant. I simply love the display and guess what it came with this such huge battery. Being a college student such big battery helps a lot seriously. Enjoying using this phone it's my first Samsung. A great phone to purchase ‚úåÔ∏è
-----
Awesome!!
-----
It's absolutely great phone. Within a week of purchase I tried its camera features along with response time navigating between apps. Within this price range It already feels like a premium phone. I am already making my husband jealous  with 64MP camera ;)
-----
Bang for buck
-----
One of the best phones at this range, period. I can't praise the Samsung os enough, the cameras are phenomenal, the phone handles heavy games with ease, the battery life is amazing and it also has a strong build as it has gorilla glass. Highly recommended
-----
Bad phone samsung galaxy m31
-----
Cemara colitis very bad i don't like it
Net very slow
-----
Just amazing
-----
The only con in this device is that the processor is a bit slow not recommended for pubg. If you really love pubg then you should consider the realme 6.
-----
Awesome phone for a common person
-----
Best middle range mobile phone at reasonable price
The monster battery gives me 2 days backup while the internet turning
The camera catches my beautiful moment with a crystal clear photos
The biometric system was perfect and lightning quick
-----
Camera not upto mark
-----
The screen is good , No lags for normal usage that's good.
Camera quality is actually pathetic for the front camera.
Back camera is ok.
Overall phone is good if you can comprise on camera
-----
Great phone
-----
Recommended!!!!
Great display
Great battery
Great ui
No lag
Above avg in gaming
Lacks premium look offered by other brands at similar price point
Value for money

I have been using this phone for 3days and based on that following is the review
Pros:
1.Good rear and front camera quality
2.large display
3.Faster processing
Cons:
1.Rear finger print sensor is not very
  comfortable
-----
JUST EXCELLENT !üëç
-----
I have purchased the product on the launching day. I have been using it since oneweek.The product is awesome at affordable price. And the camera is just outstanding . Where as the battery performance is not upto the expectations. Left over is EXCELLENT.

-----
I purchased this phone 5 days before...
Till this time I enjoyed...
camera is really stunning ..battery back up is really awesome.....This price range I felt it's a great product...Affordable price..you people can definitely go for this phone.
-----
Could have been a little better
-----
The phone is not lightening fast and I am not talking about gaming here. Secondly, the battery life is no where near 2 days. It lasts for a full day with heavy usage of normal applications and again I am not talking about Videos and Games in this usage.
-----
Awesome phone
-----
Awesome phone
The Galaxy M31 is an excellent device for multimedia and smooth for gaming sessions. Thanks to its display and Dolby Atmos 360 degree surround sound system, we enjoyed streaming videos and playing gaming like Asphalt 9 or PUBG Mobile.

Phone is good but slow charging.  Amazon service sucks.
-----
Worst amazon service dont buy any product from amazon.
Regarding this product its taking more than 5 hours to fully charge even though its mentioned as fast charger. So if u are not behind fast charging i strongly recommend this mobile.
-----
A worthy product.
-----
I bought this product a few days ago and it's pretty good till now. Display is good. Battery life is really goood.
Only camera quality could be lil better in the nights but day pictures are good.
So far a worthy product.
-----
Quite good battery life within this range!
-----
I have full charged my mobile yesterday afternoon , and now today evening 50% charge...quite good battery life.
Also Camera quality is too good. Within this approx 15000 range it is unbelievable that i could bought a mobile like Samsung Galaxy m31
-----
Compared from other Samsung phones.
-----
Phone is very good in this price. But similar configration of samsung phones like A50 having more camara quality then M31. Battery backup also good then the same. I think due to the price factor it have some less teachers. But over all very good Phone.
-----
High quality mobile phone .... M31
-----
Amazing speed and good quality camera quality is advanced. display quality is very good .. and touch quality speed all over very good
it is more better than poco x2
App speed and game speed is very very good

Amazing product under 16000. Be it the camera or battery life of the phone  or processor or screen resolution  Everything is worth the money paid. Amazing phone from Samsung.
-----
Good phone for daily usage
-----
It is a good phone for daily use and not for heavy pubg gamers.but you can play pubg on it that is not an issue.it is a very balanced phone in the market and the best samsung phone under 15000 rupees right now.
-----
Not quite satisfied
-----
-camera quality is not good.
-heating issues when used in excess.
- speed is okay.
else wise all is good.

amazon delivered this product without any proper packing i.e with no air bubble polythene sheet.
-----
Defective product
-----
There is a microphone issue, we don't like any kind of exchange due to pandemic Corona. But we feel it's defective product.
-----
Camera quality &amp; camera features &amp; processor have to improve
-----
Camera quality is not like a 64 megapixel &amp; when on the 64 megapixel resolution flash light is off by default &amp; can't zoom during 64 megapixel resolution &amp; processor is also slow compare to other same processor phone
Battery back up is excellent
-----
Samsung Galaxy M31 is really a good choice of smart phone within its range.
-----
The Samsung Galaxy M31 is perfect. Everything is too good from design to all functional things like fingerprint reader  Camera quality is very good And the battery is really massive with fastcharging. I loved it.
Thankyou Samsung for Galaxy M31.

Really, I think this is the best budget phone one could go for.. 5 for battery and the camera etc.. Over all cool and smart phone one could get in this price range.. I received the phone within 2 days. I got screen card and pouch in a very low price..
-----
Mega monster deserve
-----
Mobile is awesome and I love Samsung product but as always we expected that Samsung provide full accessories with phone that is missing specifically head phone and mobile case,that's why one star is deducted thks....

It has a great camera and the experience of the super amoled display is awesome
I would recommend everyone to try this phone once
-----
Dont buy
-----
C type charger is a big sham . It takes ages for the phone to get charged . NO WONDER samsung is loosing its market share

Hanging and auto Restarting
-----
Mobile very worst i ever seen.

multiple time hanging and auto restarting.

6GB Ram but seems like 1Gb ram preforming.
-----
Unbeatable M31
-----

Monster battery 6000 mah,1.5 to 2 days back up
Awsome Super amoled screen...
Amazing rear &amp; front camera...
Slim &amp; stylish..
Thanks samsung &amp; amazon
-----
Best phone i ever bought
-----
The front camera and back camera is awesome. Colour gradient of the device is superb. We can captur natural beauty from this device. Fingerprint sensor is also very fast. Fast phone no hanging.....ultimate very best phone at this price.
-----
FAST AND POWERFUL
-----
First I would like to thank Amazon for timely delivery and the agent for his polite behaviour.. I am happy as the phone got delivered before Holi.. About the mobile I would say it is very fast and POWERFUL as per my earlier experience..
-----
Samsung M31
-----
Product is good,bt there is no backcase,backcase for this model is also not available in store.
U had attached the backcase with the parcel??
-----
Good
-----
Very thing is quite good about this phone except for the front camera for back camera I would give this a 5 star but for the front one no it's very zoomed in and it clicks kinda blurry yellow pictures which i personally don't like rest is all good
-----
Automatically restart issue
-----
Very bad experience buying samsung. Did'nt expect this from samsung. Bought this a month ago, after 10 15 days after buying it used to suddenly restart automatically. It is happening every 3 4 days. No updates are there, then also it is happening.
-----
Best budget buy..good configuration
-----
Nice product in this price .. c type charger,faster charging, best camera quality, full day  charge on full usage..will approx last for 1.5 day. The display is smooth..easy to hold,yet to use the face unlock and explore the camera options.loved it
-----
Huge battery performance
-----
Seamless biometric access using fingerprint reader, Camera is nice, 64 MP camera is usable in broad daylight only. This mega monster comes with a huge battery of 6000 mAh, if you charge it fully then it can run from 36-48 hours under normal usage.
-----
Battery,camera,ram and samsung what else do you want!!!!
-----
The best thing about this phone is the camera and the battery life.
The camera is very good .
The battery life is the best as it charges very fast and drains very slowly.
This phone turns out to be better than the redmi note 8 pro .

Battery charging is not so fast though it's mentioned fast charging. I think charging time needs to be controlled. Camera works well and quality of phone is good. Light weight. Speaker quality needs to be improved.
-----
Charger is waste

Charging is not working properly
Quality of charger is not good
-----
Samsung M31 rocks.

Mobile quality

Camera quality is very low,display quality not good..very very bad mobile in this year.according rate device ia very very bad.
-----
Will suggest to find out other product, If you are a selfie lover
-----
I didn't find the product up to the mark as it was expected. Mainly disappointed  with camera and speakers of the phone,
I preferred  this phone just because of Samsung  but my experience is not good with this product
-----
Amazon broke trust.
-----
The phone came with a fault that the camera doesn't work, contacted customer support many times no action taken, i need a replacement.
-----
Overall nice
-----
There's an adequate amount of 6GB RAM and 64GB storage options tooehitchbi like the most. Super AMOLED display looks stunning with vibrant, saturated colours and excellent viewing angles. But headfones are not there. should be there with mobile.
-----
Amazing Product

Amazing product, Phone was too good, camera clarity Battery was not much efficient, Thank You GrabOn for giving me good deal.

Battery is too good. I don't use camera so much but it's fine for me. Screen is big and quality is best in this price range. Weight is little high but don't feel so much different. Over all best phone in this price range.

Phone is getting Heat on  near ear ....battery draining fast  don't go for it
-----
Good for me
-----
Camera quality  was excellent.  Gaming experience  was too good and amoled display is good .Everything is ok for me...but didn't understand  some problem  faced in battery consumption, then you do give us 6000mah battery ...Its not like that
-----
All rounder
-----
It's my review after 1 month of use. This is one of the best phones in this budget. Camera, battery, touch, watching videos in this super amoled screen. Gaming, etc.. all 5 star with a Samsung brand name. I'm impressed. Guys u must buy this.
-----
Good phone.
-----
Battery fast charging is lied. Takes about 3 -4 hrs for battery charging. Drains in about 24 hrs of use. Started to develop hanging problem with 25 GB of storage. Not has IR remote. You are paying only in the name of ram, storage and camera.
-----
Best buy
-----
At this price range it's a best buy...
Look 5 out of 5
Battery 5 out of 5
Camera 4 out of 5 as compared to mi a3
Speed 5 out of 5
Secure  5 out of 5
Fast and durable
Go ahead

Multimedia speakers DEAD
-----
None of the multimedia speakers working.. today is 15th day since I bought it and so the return window has closed now and I am stuck with the speakers that don't work properly.. Ugh sooo FRUSTRATING!
-----
Though it has 6GB Ram it lags at times. Not for gaming as well.
-----
Received a damaged product which have a uneven camera panel and slightly dislocated finger print sensor. Fortunately it will be replaced today.
-----
Amazon and Samsung are fooling customers. Don't get trapped.
-----
Amazon is fooling people and providing faulty products.
This mobile I purchased is faulty. When I am raising a request for return they are just making me to hang around their rubbish policies. Now I am preparing to go to consumer court.

I purchased this phone and was delivered to me today.After 5 minutes of use this phone starts heating .Camera is good ,all in all phone is good but after heating problem that I faced how can i recommend someone to buy this phone.
-----
Good mobile phone
-----
The phone is userfriendly. I have used it for 2 weeks.  The only part is the charger. We need to use only the charger that comes along with the package. Will not fit any other Samsung chargers. Otherwise working fine as expected.
-----
value for money prodect
-----
paid 16k  for this product and i think it's value for money well camera quality is not that good as shown in trailer but all other things are good and even not expecting much from this because it's not iPhone and as well not huge expansive.
-----
Awesome camera phone from samsung
-----
This product is really  awesome.
1. Camera quality is superb, I took all my holi pics from this and all are clear and really awesome.
2. Battery backup is great.
3. Phone's look is very sexy.
4. Overall phone is awesome.

Near at my dreems

E wowwwww..it's amazing mobile near about my needs n dreems .too much sufficient battery life I feel tired to use mobile bt battery still standing smiling .camera performance superb n perfect .n fingerprint..it's workings perfect super fast
-----
My think.
-----
Mobile outside look and camera quality is good....
Battery life is too high...
Battery backup...normally 2days.
Fingerprint reader is working nice..quickly response...

I think easy to handle all generation people..
-----
Nice product!!
-----
If you're looking for a phone with a good battery backup, display and camera then M31 is best choice at this price. It would be better if they provide back cover with the phone itself. I'm not a heavy gamer so battery lasts more than 24hrs.
-----
Pathetic Phone
-----
Phone is pathetic keeps restarting on its own, Cannot use basic functions like making calls or receiving system UI hangs and restarts on its own. Even after factory reset and no apps installed it does the same. Do not waste money on Samsung
-----
Best mobile for cheap price
-----
I had some doubts about this mobile model... Bcoz of samsung have produced high technical configuration for less price...
 But now I'm using m31, i can't believe it's camera and all other futures are unbelievable.. thanks a lot samsung
-----
I am happy with my Samsung galaxy m31
-----
Its amazing and what ever time I have spent on m31
It is nice its battery is long lasting and the camera is amazing I love th live focus camera and the main camera of 64 mp it's very nice and the fingerprint and face lock is excellent.

Camera Good, Heats up too much
-----
The phone works smooth, camera quality too good, battery life is not as expected, drains out too soon, the phone heats up too much. Can't keep near the face on call for more than 5 minutes, in case of video calls..the heating is unbearable.
-----
Charging adapter
-----
Good phone worth each and every rupee
-----
Display was awesome and mobile was working fast and regarding performance it is very nice.
Battery was perfect.
 Camera is really great and  image quality is perfect.
Worth each and every rupee
-----
Average quality
-----
Every time i am being told to put whole finger on the reader, at the time of zooming pics it gets blurred great battery life it is genuinely a maha battery.
-----
Nice phone. Width is minimal to keep in hands. Gud exchange offer.
-----
Good phone in this price. Very much liked. Width is minimal and easy to keep in hand.  But it is taking more than 3 hrs for full charge.
-----
Good device with such price.
-----
Finger print is awesome, but I am more conserned about the primary camera quality, the pictures are not that clear when capture with 9:16 resolution settings. and finally, battery life is just okay.
-----
Budget mobile with some advanced features
-----
Likes: Battery, mobile weight, fast charging option, front camera, fast finger print un lock, face lock, Sar value is very low.
Dislike: Poor picture quality in low light (64mp), back panel, light heating issue in continuous speaking..
-----
Complient about defected piece
-----
I got defected piece....
It has problem related with calls and ringtone....
We can't able to hear the voice of caller....
-----
No-brainer for 'the man with 9to5 job'
-----
Good display and battery life with fluid exploring of the phone. Felt a tiny lag sometimes 1/1000 times. But camera is working finely for the money I spent on this. Overall no-brainer as daily driver for 'the man with 9to5 job'.
-----
Best phone Samsung m31
-----

From 10 days I am using this handset from 3 days I am facing WhatsApp hanging Issues and I am not satisfied with display quality, it's it's yellow shade on Display.Fingerprint reader is no at the mark. Camera quality is ok. No as 64 MP...

Samsung M31 is one of the amazing mobile phones I used infact I liked it for its look and the screen clarity. I am totally having a great experience . If you want to have everything in your mobile then go and grab one and enjoy using it!!

-----
Camera, video and signal strength is poor

64mp camera is not good, in night mode camera is not working properly, when I play video in the middle its going black and blur, signal strength is not good, and I replace the sim to another mobile signal strength is very good.

Great product by samsung
-----
The phone is awesome at this price point. The finger print sensor is fast. Battery life is good will run for almost 2 days. The 64MP camera can't be zoomed when used. Or else you have to use it on less mp so as to zoom out.

Best Performing Phone in midrange
-----

Good product....good layout...just two things back plastic cover is not that classy, package should include a back cover, rest everything is cool..
-----
Best economic class phone from Samsung
-----
Nice Samsung phone at this price range. Some  features like camera,  battery life etc are brilliant. Using the phone from last 2 month completely satisfied. Recommended people who loves to take good snapshots , requires long battery etc.
-----
One piece of tech that everyone should afford.
-----
Pros - With full video HD, streaming or download / upload; all is very good. With 64 Mega Pixel rear camera provides best picture quality. Battery life with such heavy load goes uptown 9-10 hours.
Cons - wifi drains too much battery
-----
Good product in this price.
-----
Work mobile ever used
-----
Booked the mobile on the day of release with huge expectations. But its not up to the mark. Fingerprint doesn't work good. Touch experience is not good. Phone getting hang frequently. Auto switchoff.... worst experience in 5 days of use.
-----
Fingerprint Reader,Camera &amp; Battery Facts
-----
Don't Buy this phone because In Every Phone Finger print Reader was not fit properly on right side fingerprint reader is too much deep in Body. Also as per 64Mega Pixel camera is there but result is average. Battery life is also regular.
-----
Very dissatisfied and disappointed
-----
The product received seems to be a defective piece as it not charging though left whole  night and moreover the phone is heating up....very dissatisfied and disappointed
-----
WORST Phone
-----
Its not a good product to buy. A lot issues such as Bluetooth not work properly, Apps do not get updated correctly, Hang during update, screen off even after change in settings etc
-----
After having Mega Monster

Review of fingerprint &amp; sound quality
-----
Mobile is very easy to handle battery life is also but touchpad is not so good it will not working properly also sound quality is very bad when we call some one sound is not clear also fingerprint sensor not catch fingerprint quickly
-----
Overall Such a good mobile
-----
Fingerprint is too faster. Camera quality is very super. But battery charging is slow.They told fast charging but it is not like they said.but battery power withstand is about 1.5 days .yeah overall such a good mobile for this price.
-----
Definitely a best buy in this price range
-----
Pros:
1. Battery. It's a Monster.
2. Android 10 with OneUI 2.0 is working smooth
3. Camera is satisfactory

Cons:
1. 64mp camera is buried inside the aspect ratio settings. That was weird and unexpected.
-----
My opinion on this device
-----
The megamonster M31 is well in all my required features but it doesn't  contain speed up on the top view options and pixel is better &amp; good but some extra editing facilities are required in camera app whatever it is comfortable to me

Great smart phone under  Rs 15000

I am getting in love with this phone. Feels solid in hand. Display is awesome. Camera is really great. Performance is very good, no lag anywhere . With heavy usage battery last for more than one and halfday or more.
-----
One word: Amazing

Though bought just two days back, I'm awed at the battery longevity. I can watch series all day and still not worry about battery drainage. Plus, the display and the camera quality.  Do go for it without a second thought.
-----
Good smartphone and minor issues
-----
Fingerprint issue....sometimes lag issue in normal use....but all over good smartphone....and feel so good in hand, display quality awsome ....nd i am samsung lover thats why i  buy this phone....small issues may be solve by updates

A best midrange mobile from samsung

Samsung m31

I dumped IPHONE 7 FOR Samsung galaxy  M31.
I really like its 64 mgpxl 4 camera .
I love it
-----
The est mobile in 15000 to 16000 price range.
-----
Very nice mobile. Camera is amazing. Macro and panorama pictures are amazing.
-----
Worst Smart Phone
-----
Battery performance is very and very poor. I will give 2 star for battery backup and I suggest to all of you please don't buy it. Even from camera is not good, screen size is also small compare to other brands.
-----
Specifications are totally false
-----
The phone is nothing short of a cheat from Samsung. It boasts of a quad camera with 64 MP. However, it performs worse than a 24 MP camera. It hangs many a times. It gets heated up every now and then.
-----
Samsung m31 - the best Samsung phone of this price range
-----
Fingerprint reader at sometimes won't open the phone. Camera quality is one of the best I have seen in phones of this range price . Battery life is almost better as of camera . Sometimes it doesn't show the capacity as of 6000may.
-----
Best in genuine range
-----
There is nothing to dislike about th product.  Battery backup is gr8 !! most essential .. Then comes camera front n back both r gud..  Functioning is good.  But sad thing is THEY didnt provide Any phone cover  not transparent one.
-----
Super battery life and camera

Quality issues..lemon
-----
Lease than a month and a half, the phone does not charge with the charger and only charges when plugged to a computer. Seemingly, there is some issue with the charging port. Quality speaks.
-----
Marvelous... wohoohoo
-----
It's really Monster ... woohoo woo.. eco friendly Big Screen Camera quality is Absolutely Masss , I have bought first this much cost of mobile , I'm really very happy to Buying this Mobile . Thanks to Samsung
-----
The phone is more than it says
-----
I was thinking of buying One Plus 7 but did not buy because of budget.
But I don't regret buying Samsung Galaxy M31 because of the performance.
It definitely competes with One Plus 7 with less price
-----
Worth for the money, camera is off the limits
-----
Been using this for a week now.
Camera is of excellent quality.
Especially the macro photos.
The battery life is amazing.
The fingerprint reader is not as quick as in other mobiles , but it is also a good one.

Too much in such a little thing

Overall it's one of the best devices what I like about it is it's battery life camera fingerprint sensor and amoled display..
 it rarely hangs while playing games
But if u r a regular user than u gonna love this phone
-----
Awesome üòä
-----
The thing which Samsung has to increase the length of data cable.
And company should provide a back cover with the handset as there is no cover in the market which fit to this phone.
Otherwise the phone is awesome. üòä
-----
Heating  Problem..don't  buy

Samsung M31 problme
-----
Hi sir the phone samsung M31 is not good it is a very slow processing and camera is not good  yet all so I need return my phone but as you give time is completed so please consider my request and return back my mobile thank you
-----
Good but few things to be corrected
-----
Everything is good. Few essential features having problems. sharing pictures with other apps like messenger is having some problems. Idk why it is. And also location sharing from Google map to other apps are also not working...
-----
Great Value for money.
-----
Overall good experience.
Great Camera, battery and UI.,
Amoled Screen is next level.
For a budget of 15k it's the best.
It's far better than the faulty Chinese (redmi and realme) phones.
-----
Charger not good touch not working properly
-----
Charger looks like fake product to me...I am in confusion it is Samsung fault or Amazon...after 1 and half hour charge it is 20% only charged....also touch not working some times properly... please advise how can I be justified

Nothing more to say.
Phone get heated in between, but AI comes up and inform that some app or other is consuming battery and ask to take corrective action. Liked the phone.
64 MP photos are crisp and clear.
-----
Best budget phn.
-----
Battery is quite good.using from day night..need one time gull charge.camera is awesome. Face unlock is fast and so fingerprint. OVER ALL best budget phone. Due to many graphics effect uses battery.Macro photography.
-----
Worst Product
-----
I am not satisfied at all.sim is only volte and 3g support so while using mobile network it is take long time to loading.The battery is dropping fast.M 31 is 6gb but my old phone is 3gb,it is 3 times faster than m31.

Below Average Phone Quality
-----
Phone is bulky. Camera quality is decent. The screen broke within 2 days of purchasing, even though it said corning gorilla glass.
-----
Killer Features and Satisfied with overall quality..
-----
Excellent  features and the only area of improvement thay I could see with 3 weeks of usage is that they can work on processor as it is getting hung some times.
-----
Excellent phone in such meagre price
-----
Wonderful mobile with lots of excellent unmatched features at a meagre price..
-----
Good mobile in this range.

Camera quality is good. Charger is little disappointing..not charge the mobile rapidly  like other do. Overall worth to buy in this price.

Worth the money.

I loved the overall performance of the phone. The macro mode is exceptionally good. The battery performance is real good. Stands for almost 1 and a half days even with intense use. Real worth for the money.
-----
My first Samsung experience
-----
Well the cost to benefit ratio of this phone is amazing.... Really love the camera and the touch of this phone. The processor is fairly quick and the display is awesome. Battery life is manageable so far.
-----
An amazing all roundet
-----
Great camera monstrous battery and a good UI. Buy this phone if you want an all rounder performance for your mobile.Camera quality is just great and battery is very last longing.
Gaming is also good.
-----
Average Phone but Batter is not as per expectation.
-----
Disappointed with battery performance as 6000 MaH Battery does not last as it should. I was using Redmi Note 8 Pro which had less batter size however it used to last more than M31 with same usage pattern.
-----
Value for money
-----
Very good
Must have come with headsets too and
The charger must have been the usual one not c type
-----
Value for Money
-----
This mobile has a huge battery which is the best and the super amoled display is at it's best. Camera is very nice. This mobile comes with 15w charger which makes it 3hours to charge completely.

3. Already I was using 5000 maH mobile, so I find no difference in this mobile.

Overall its a good budget mobile.

Fingerprint takes a bit longer to process, Camera quality is good it could have been greater by looking at the configuration. Battery life is good, after frequently using the camera the battery does not drain out.

Finger print reder it sence little late otherwise ok  camara quality  good but selfe ok  battery life also not up to the mark  TQ

Not a good product

A basic headphone and cover should be with the phone. Bcoz when it's with the box it's always compatible and fit with the gadget. And after using it for 2 months its heating up fast and reboot automatically any time in 2-3 days
-----
This device is really good for in this price

In this device  fingerprint is working

Good phone in this price range but certain things to be updated like option of blocking  unwanted messages is not available and some error while receiving msges in group chat in whatsapp
-----
Measures to be corrected
-----
1. Finger print  is  not working every morning. Only after putting the pattern the phone  starts.
2.Though fast charging is provided,  to get full charge it takes about three hours.
-----
Beast with more power
-----
Awesome camera quality, 6000mAh means extra time for entertainment, talking,browsing etc etc etc.... better sensor for fingerprint reading than inbuilt screen. Smooth handling and usage. Worthy and value ofr money...
-----
Avrage not acceptation according to my choice
-----
Some time automatic hang this phone so its my bad experience second thing face and  fingerprint sensor not good while vivo like other mobile s sensor too good battery take more time to fully charged like 5 to 6 hours

Overall good but not for game lover
-----
Mobile is superb for battery and camera but if you are pubg lover this phone is not for you...finger print and face unlock is quiet good but not the best....only problem I am facing is;its hanging during pubg mobile.
-----
A complete package in this price range
-----
An upgrade to the M30s version, Samsung M31 has an amazing camera. Once charged, the battery lasts for at least 2-3 days for a medium usage. The touch is very smooth. M31 is one of the best phones in its price range.
-----
Just love with M31
-----
Samsung has amazing lineup with new mobile.
M31 has great screen and battery performance.
I just love to use it.
M31 is also good with performance. With no hanging issue.
Also 64mp camera is great

It's worth the money. Battery life is really good. Takes some 3-4h to charge. Camera is decent. Front camera is also really good. Call quality is good enough. It's a well balanced phone.
-----
Nice phone but 'gorilla glass???'
-----
Nice phone good camera quality, battery life best, fingerprint reader best, but doubt about gorilla  glass cause damaged after fall from my pocket on hard tile
-----
Not Up to the mark
-----
Overhearing is the main issue when we going to charging,multitasking.front camera is better than rear.battery will drain out if you're using dual 4g sim
-----
Awesome battery power
-----
Amazing picture quality beautiful color battery life 2 to 3 days very nice ...thanks Amazon for 2 day delivery to a remote location very fast service booked order on Saturday Monday morning I was using it.
-----

I am really happy about the product. One of the best handset at this price range. Been using it for three days and it is as smooth as butter. The best thing about the phone is the UI. I absolutely love it.

Best you can get in 16k
-----
Best in 16k range phone, sleek design, real fast functioning  and mammoth battery  that last for 2 days in a single charge. Camera lives betond the expectation. Just go for it.
-----
Good but not up to expectations as they advertised
-----
Day by day its performance is decreasing. Some times fingerprint won't work and some time it turns off while using. Battery and camera are good but heats up when it's charging.
-----
Mega monster

I hv updated the phone with software updated and it is hanged and now waiting for customer care since 1 month. it is very bad experience of software updating 3rd time in less than a month. so many updates very bad
-----
Mega monster is awesome.
-----
Awesome mobile with great features. What I like most is, its camera quality and slow and ultra slow motion video recording. This mobile gives a great touch screen experience and has a excellent fingerprint sensor.
-----
Bahut hi gazab mobile h
-----
After using 10 days.. Just saying Awesomeeee.. Everything in this mobile is Awesome. I love it in every aspect whether in Camera Quality, Screen Colors, Battery etc.  All is great. Just without thinking Go for it.
-----
Not recommended
-----
The phone seems to be ok, but pathetic service from Samsung. There are frequent software issues due to incompetent engineering. Overall, I don't suggest not just this phone, but none of the Samsung phone to anyone
-----
Super battery life
-----
I was using second hand iphone 7 that means suffering with battery back up. One of the reasons of buying m31 its 6000 mah battery and 128 gb for only 16k. One of the best phones I recommend in this price category.
-----
Amazing Product in mid range phone.
-----
Nice amazing mobile. I used for 2 weeks. And it's working so fine. Processor is good. Camara is also good. Best part is bettery capacity and super amoled screen which give you best UI interface. Thank you samsung.

64 Megapixels camera gives Good Quality picture
-----
Samsung Galaxy M31 mobile has got 64 Megapixels camera &amp; 32 Megapixels selfie camera gives very good picture quality. Battery life is also decent gives good backup.
-----
Could be better
-----
Design is ordinary.. could be much better for m31 .. whole series seems same... Make something different for this.all over performance is nice . Battery charging time is too much because of 15w charger
-----
Worth your money
-----
Its having lot of good specs in a budget smartphones. Really loved it .

Pros:
Long battery (6000 mah) with fast charging
Camera quality awesome
Smooth performance with 6gb ram
-----
Not the quality product I expected
-----
The screen is very bad hardware. During normal use itself scratches have appeared. My previous phone I had used for 3 years and the first scratch appeared was only when in fell down recently and broke.
-----
Amazon Marketed for dump product of Samsung
-----
Its cheating from both Samsung and Amazon,mobile is getting hang,camera is just ok.Please don't create unnecessary hype for any product,i always believe that Amazon is brand.This is not fare.
-----
Good but not the best.
-----
Phone got switched off twice till now even after the battery  percentage being maintained at 50+. Someone please advice.
Rest all worth buying
-----
Average phone
-----
I did not find the fingerprint sensor, camera and battery life impressive... I feel as per the promise Samsung could not deliver its features as such..back camera is good but the front camera is not as expected.
-----
Best phone
-----
Best phone at this range , fingerprint  reader  much improved than m30s, battery good  but some time  she heated , charging  is very slow, almost 2.5 hrs to battery  full charge,  other features  are ok and good

It's processor is slower than snapdragon processor and 6000mAH battery should be working for at least 3 days but it's working capacity is 1 and half days. But Camera and display quality are superb.
-----
Worth the buy under the budget, it's just fone
-----
Its has an amazing display, battery back up and camera for the budget. And it looks neat and classy ....
-----
Samsung Galaxy M31 is superb in your budget
-----
Samsung Galaxy M31 fingerprint capture so quickly. Camera quality is superb and battery backup is very best.
If you do not use only calling ,you use 24√ó7 hour ,4 to 5 days but your depending on network.
-----
its OK
-----
some time I find, phone is heating. I prefer Samsung instead of buy any chines phone. safety cover expected along with device. Battery consume fast, charging also slow as do not expected with 6k mAH battery.

M31 Super Phone with low budget
-----
Terrific battery life, Attractive AMOLED display,Smooth software experience.

Display quality is horrible üò±
-----
Picture quality is really good but display aahhh!!!

Nice package under this price range.
-----
Overall a nice package. The front camera with face recognition is a bit slow and the missing rapid charge option are the only two negatives I can point out. Other features and look wise phone is a good deal.

Battry backup of m31. i.e. 6000mah is not as expected.
Battry backup is just equal to or little better than  galaxy on8.
Disappointed!!!!
-----
Just buy.  Trust me.
-----
Very good. Just go for it. 64 MP is much better. Quality is too good. I left my vivid v17 Pro and vive v11 pro.
Using Samsung a50s and m31. Very good. Global brand. Too many customization.

Wonderful phone

I have been using this phone for a little over a week now and so far it has been really great. I have not encountered ant problems and I feel like this is one of the best phones for this price.
-----
Good phone with some flaws
-----
The battery is not upto the mark. It doesn't seem like it is 6000 MaH. Also, the auto-rotate doesn't work properly. And the speaker isn't loud enough. These few things could have been improved.
-----

Notification bar automatically comes down sometimes.

It would have been good if the a cover is available within the box. Otherwise phone is good

Performance of the phone is good battery, display and software. The only problem of my device is it's charging slowly, and it's taking 2 hours 30 minutes to 3 hours to complete 100% charging
-----
Super Samsung

Best in market in it's price segment, classy design, Super amoled display makes this phone standing out of the crowd. Mega battary is pretty good one. Overall gud package at this price poin.

-----
Very very good phone which undergoes your budget
-----
This phone is very cheap. The performance is more than its price. If you look for the budget phone go for it. The camera and battery are extreme.
-----
Value for money with all mega features

Wide screen, will give you good viewing experience, 6000mah monster battery, good for continuous browsing and watching movies. Headphones not included, bit disappointing.

M31 review
-----
The touch on the screen is very fluid, battery is amazing and the most important is the brand value. I have more trust on long standing brands like  Samsung and Apple than Oppo, Vivo etc.
-----
Totally waste
-----
Camera was not good,it's not a 64 mp ,and also produce heat while using camera.
No sound clarity ...no clear in full volume.
No battery  backup...This product was totally  waste
-----
Good product
-----
Front camera is not good. I was using vivo vo before this phone. Vivo v9 comes with 24mp but vivo v9's front camera is far better than Samsung m31's front camera.. all features are good..
-----
OVERALL WOTH BUYING
-----
SPEAKER ONLY ONE SIDE, BUT BOTTOM TWO SIDES TWO SPEAKERS NEEDED,  WITHIN ONE HOUR FAST CHARGER, BACKSIDE CAMERAS EMBOSSED, WILL GET SCRATCHES WITHOUT BACK COVER, OCEAN BLUE 128 GB NEEDED,

Battery life is  fantastic  ..with moderate use upto 48 hrs  fingerprint reader  comfortably placed .and camera 32mp front and 64 mp rear is the iceing on the cake  5 stars  all the way
-----
Battery is bad

Very disappointed from its battery
-----
Heating issues while charging it

Product is not according to given features .camera quality is not according to 64 mega pixel. Phone get heated very soon ....I don't like it.front camera  quality is very bad.
-----

Battery Taking 4.5 hour for Full Charge &amp; Amazon's After sale Service Disappointing
-----
It's taking more than 4.5 hours for a full Charge and  draining so fastly. I asked for a replacement,  waiting  for the long process  for replacement which again disappoint.
-----
The best mobile
-----
This is the best phone of the Samsung with its battery of 6000mah and camera of 64 mp and the sAmoled screen in it and the speaker of Dolby atmos and a best processor of exynos 9611
-----
Not as expected
-----
Been using samsung m31 for the past 12 hrs , with normal use (texting,music : no gaming ) ,on 4g network, battery drained to 30% , screen on time _ 6hrs  ;
6000mah = 3000mah !!
-----
Great display and Good battery
-----
Pros
1.Super display and touchscreen
2.Great battery
3. Android 10
4.brand value
Cons
1.processor performance is average

Review about my m31
-----
Worth for the price, camara quality is awesome.

It slow charging not fast charging as mentioned. It takes more than 2 hrs to full charge but it gives a long time battery.
-----
Very Disappointed.
-----
Mobile getting  heat while charging and when we open selfie camera. Given complaints  to Amazon but they are not serious. I am disappointed. It's better to go with redmi note 8 pro.
-----
Everything is good...except poor video quality even super amoled display
-----
I like it very much...all features are good ...I am writing this review after using the mobile....video quality should be improved which is average even though super amoled display.

Can be improved
-----
Mobile is good  but screen gesture  can be made better like screenshots  snapshot  gesture is not so comfortable. Other  things are good and back cover should be given with handset.
-----
Awesome product..üëåüëåüòç

-----
Overall is good for this budget range
-----
Finger print is much better,camera is very average in low light and noise is more in low light battery life is good for normal use for gaming is not good

This product is a real option for the people wanting to buy something higher and have limited money .
Like samsung has made it a complete monster with keeping every spec wide .

Macro camera is amazing and battery lasts up to 2-3 days .Camera could have been better in bright conditions like lamps and lights as there is lot of reflection in the pictures.

Display and humungous battery. Not so good UI.

Please ..please.. do not go for Samsung M31 at all.

very Responsive fingerprint reader, Have good camera quality but bokeh mode is not match my expectations. 6000mah battery which gives you full day back up with moderate usage.

Rear Cam doesn't look like 64mp and picture quality is not as expected. First half of the battery is draining faster than the later. Overall experience with the phone is good.
-----
The M31, Recommendable
-----
Finger print reader is quick, 64mp really works, Battery life is 3days during mediocre use of internet and no games.
Should have given a case with it.
Recommendable.

I will definitely say .. chip and best phone among recent phones with brand value.

Camera quality is very nice,especially micro cam is amazing.  It's take up3 hours for fully charge. Backup time is 14hours.

If you are heavy user then it will last 1 or 1¬Ω day but for average user it can last 2 days and other things  are nice.

Over all best product in this range

Best quality rear camera with 64 mp. Fast charging is very helpful with long lasting battery life. Sometimes fingerprint doesn't work at first. With some other cool features.

Best phone in this range

It's great feeling to use Samsung M31 but the processor could be snapdragon and the speaker grill is only one so it sounds little low otherwise there is no single drawback

6GB RAM is nothing

Phone has 6GB ram, but phone screen lags while playing games and games get stuck while playing..
Phone gets too heated very easily while playing games and video call.
-----
A phone that you can trust..

Camra quality unbeatable
Ram high on speed
Battery life 9 out of 10 its ok

M31 Review

The battery performance is less than expected
It is advertised as 6000mah, but gives the performance of a lower capacity battery.

Worst battery ..
Manufactures shows that 6000 mah..
I think it is below 3000 mah..
Battery drain rapidly..
What can i do?

Moderate

I dislike the camera settings. The selfie camera is not satisfactory. The user interface needs a lot of improvement.

The audio system is also very poor

Good Not Bad

Camera result is not as expected. But overall good Phone in this range.
-----
Phone restarting abruptly
-----
Phone is not working, it is restarting abruptly a number of times while using. Battery is draining within a day. For a 6000mah battery it should not drain so fast
-----
Good one.
-----
Good look. Nice to handle. But photos are showing black spots on face. Good clarity in camera. Just not  removing black spots.

Everything else perfect.

The samsung M31 is yet another affordable smartphone of M series. It has a lot to show off starting with a large display, big battery capacity and  a Quad-camera.
-----
Face unlock very bad.
-----
Display is osm.
But design is not so good . It doesnt give premium look. Bettry  is good .
Face lock  is worst . Sometimes it even didnot recognise you.

The display is awesome. Moreover, the camera can beat quality of digital cameras. Just one suggestion- it would be great if it had a Qualcomm processor

Best Smartphone under 15k....Amazing experience. Cameron Performance really good.
-----
Face unlock feature and camera quality is not so good
-----
Face unlock is not properly work
Finger print reader is slow
Camera quality not much better
Expect these all features are very good
-----
Very good option in budget range
-----
The phone is very good for the price range. Although Samsung should have provided earphones and a cover.
-----
Charger is given in this package is 5v 2amp
-----
I found the charger in this package have 5v 2amp output, in the specifications they show it support 18w fast charge....
-----
Best mid range phone ....
-----
Awesome phone at an awesome price. Mega battery lasts for more than 2 days. Mega display and mega 64 mega pixel camera ... its really a mega phone.
