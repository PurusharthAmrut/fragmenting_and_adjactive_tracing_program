READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY M40.

Hey, guys bought this phone in the second sale and I have bought the seawater blue variant (6GB RAM + 128GB  ROM) which is priced for Rs 19990.

*It comes in a typical Samsung packaging and inside the box you will get the M40, Charging brick, USB Type C cable, Type C earphones, user manual, Sim ejector pin. (images attached)

*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.

*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.

*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).

*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).

*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.

DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.

*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.

PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 &amp; it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.

GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops  Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 &amp; 9 works great

SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.

STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.

SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp &amp; clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.

LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.

It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great &amp; it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)

In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.

The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.

BATTERY PERFORMANCE—It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.

It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.

Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-

PROS—

1) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.

2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.

3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.

4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).

5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.

6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.

7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.

8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI &amp; Android Pie.

9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.

10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.

11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.

12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms &amp; 7.9MM thick).

13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.

14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.

15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.

16) There are many launch offers from many operators.

Cons—

1) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.

2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.

3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.

VERDICT—

If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software &amp; good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.

Thank you for reading my review.

I got this phone as a gift. I like the overall design of the phone and it feels like a premium phone.

But when I use the camera on this device, I see flickering of the screen and it is extremely evident even in the video playback. This is ridiculous when you are marketing this device with one of the USP being a great camera.

Now, I understand that some devices may be faulty. But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone? Can I just not send a video of using it to prove its faulty?

User experience is not what I imagined it to be. Unlke in USA, the service here is lacking by Amazon!

So, today i am reviewing on this new phone. I am using this phone from last 4-5 days.

The Samsung Galaxy M40 offers a refined design as compared to the other M-series smartphones from the company. It is quite compact despite bearing a 6.3-inch screen and lightweight to hold. The back comes with a gradient finish with edges reflecting the light blue colour, while the center is dark. This surely gives a premium look and feel to the device, which is particularly absent in other Galaxy M smartphones. This smartphone from Samsung comes loaded with Infinity-O display, which is present in the company’s flagship series.

Now comes to its review

For Gamers:

If you are gamer then this one is best phone i play Pubg too much that works too smooth without any lags. this one is great on this phone

Coming to camera: that primary camera comes with 32-megapixel camera and front camera comes with 16-megapixel camera. while videocall and selfies that gives best pictures. in day light the quality of camera is awesome. This phone delivers best photos when the lights are present in ample amount. The 5-megapixel depth sensor also does a good job here. This coupled with Live Focus delivers a good photo in daylight conditions and it looks quite natural in nature.

Looks wise:
Now comes to looks, looks wise this is amazing. i just love the look of this phone from backside that is really an amazing.

Battery:
Battery wise i just want to tell that this phone is just a beast that comes with fast charging. Battery life is good if you are using that phone normally. i like the battery backup of this.

Audio:
They gave type c port earphones that is really nice. sound quality is really amazing

Cons:

Till now i didn’t found any cons in this will update review if i found any issue in that. just one little issue which i fount till now that is you can’t hold your phone single handed that was too slippery in back if you hold that single handed.

Overall at this price range this is really a good phone. this is best in this range. you will love that.

Display and camera are great. Phone looks good. Only supports type C headphones which might be a problem for few

1. Display quality is just below average, though touch response is good
2. Call quality is very poor, voice of the person speaking from other side is barely audible. I mean come on this is the most basic thing we expect from a mobile phone to do, don't understand why have they used this screen sound casting technology
3. For me non existence of 3.5 mm headphone jack is just not a big deal

Voice quality during the call is very poor. Sounds Robotic and its really hard to understand the caller. May be due to on display earpiece. Very bad experience. Moreover one cannot replace or return the item. Amazon is not letting to do so.

=======
👍 Infinity display similar to the Galaxy S10 now in M40 }-- Looks like the more expensive Galaxy S10e display
👍 6.3” size, with 91.8% screen to body ratio }-- very thin bezels on top and sides
👍 PLS LCD display Samsung's proprietary technology }-- Wish it had AMOLED, but PLS LCD offers better viewing angles and higher max brightness
👍 Full HD+ resolution 1080x2340 ~409ppi }-- Wide vine L1 certified, runs Amazon Prime videos in true HD
👍 Punch Hole notch }-- for me this looks better than regular notches, wallpapers are there to hide the notch ;)

PROCESSOR &amp; GPU
================
👍 Snapdragon 675 Octa-core (2x2.0 GHz Kryo 460 Gold &amp; 6x1.7 GHz Kryo 460 Silver) }-- The latest 6xx series snapdragon processor
👍 11nm processor }-- low power usage, battery lasting longer
👍 Adreno 612 GPU }-- PUBG runs smoothly in HD graphics with High Frame Rate, Asphalt 9 also runs without any lags and is smooth.

STORAGE &amp; RAM
===============
👍 6 GB RAM }-- no lags in multitasking, was able to run several application and switch between them with ease
👍 128 GB Storage
🆗  Expandable storage }-- I was able to use the hybrid sim slot for SD card

PROTECTION
===========
👍  Corning Gorilla Glass protection for display }-- not sure on the version though
👎🏻  No IP rating }-- honestly I don't expect a mid-ranger to have IP certifications
👍 SAR value 0.200 W/Kg }-- not much radiation, do it's better than brands like Xiaomi

BATTERY &amp; CHARGING
===================
👍  3500 mAh Li-Po battery }-- 1 day battery life with normal usage. Can get 5 hours of on-screen time on heavy usage with videos, gaming and mobile data with sync which is very good. Battery optimization is very good.
👍  15W charging }-- it just took ~36 minutes to charge from 0% to 50%, but 50% to 100% might take a bit longer.

CAMERA
=======
👍 Triple Rear Camera setup }-- An upgraded and better camera from M30, expecting software updates for better post processing. Current software processing is okay but can be improved as the camera hardware is a good one.
👍 32 MP, f/1.7 with PDAF }--  Good day light shots and low light photos were a hit and miss, it's good for this segment but can improve. Am hoping the software updates from Samsung for the camera should make this a lot better and the best in the segment, waiting for them.
👍 8MP, f/2.2, 12mm Ultrawide Camera }-- Able to cover a wide area around 123 degree field of view.
👍 5MP depth sensor camera }--  edge detection was good in portrait shots.
👍 Super Slow motion and Slow motion }-- the super slow-mo videos are superb
👍 4K video recording
👍 16MP Front Camera }-- Selfies were very good in daylight. The beautify mode is good. Waiting for more updates on the camera post-processing. But this is same as pictures taken from A50 which has a 25MP camera.

SOFTWARE &amp; NETWORK
=====================
👍  ONE UI 1.1 on top of Android 9.0 (Pie) }-- lots of features, simpler, smoother and very clean interface
👍  Not much bloatware or no Ads like the Xiaomi's Redmi.
👍  Very good Battery optimization, but still can be improved. Expecting updates to further enhance.
👍  Has all Indian Bands covered with dual VoLTE.

OTHER FEATURES
===============
🆗 No 3.5 mm headphone jack }-- Only type C earphones can be used or need to use Type-C to 3.5mm adapter but most phones in future will move to Type C earphones
👍 Type C earphones provided along with the phone }-- thanks for the earphones
👍  On Screen Sound }-- The entire display is the speaker, so while taking call I was able to hear the other person by placing my ear on any part of the display. No worries about earpiece grill and dust. Keep ear on the screen. First time it might take some time to adjust, but soon you might start liking this as you don't need to keep the ear at a specific place.
👍  Support Dolby Atmos }-- Very good quality sound from bottom firing speakers, and screen doubles as a speaker too.
👍  Rear Finger print reader }-- placed in a good position reachable by the finger and is fast.
🆗 No infrared remote, not a deal breaker for me.
👍  Bluetooth version 5.0 with A2DP, LE.
🆗 Dual tone colored but 2 color options only  }-- I wish there was a red, white and black variant.
👍 The phone is just 7.9mm and weighs 168grams. It easy to hold and grip.

OVERALL - WORTHY BUY
========  :::::::::::::::::::::
&gt;&gt; When considering this price segment, the Samsung M40 seems to be the best all rounder.
&gt;&gt; Hoping that the the software updates can make the capable camera hardware to do best job and also enhance battery, though am satisfied with the current performance. You can check the pictures i took with the M40 on a gloomy day where sunlight was less.

👌🏼 The latest 675 processor, On Screen Sound technology, Dolby Atmos sound, Type C with earphones in the box, triple camera setup, super slow motion, 6GB RAM for multitasking, 128GB on board storage with expandable storage and within Rs.20000 makes this the best budget All-Rounder phone from Samsung.
👉 Amazon giving the phone as exclusive and with offers from all major carriers makes is a good move.
👌🏼  PUBG and Asphalt runs smooth with HD and High settings makes me happy with the buy. Good to have Snapdragon in the M series.

Overall a great budget phone within 20k, the Infinity O Display looks so cool and it looks like a S10e. Though the current display looks very good especially with punch hole notch, I wish the display was AMOLED. And also wish there was a red or white variant and maybe a metallic finish. The phone has touched all areas with a good score.

Please dont buy it.
The main issue is battery. Its heating after taking 2-3 pics, also draining very fast.
  I have seen it first day and want to change with other model, but they didn't help with that. So please choose other option. Its not worthy to money.

Camera Quality is really bad , feels like a device from 2019 has a camera quality of 2015.
The Device started to heat in just 15-30 minutes of Video call on Whatsapp.
Previously I used to use
Redmi note 5 pro but I have never faced any heating issue that too In a Xiomi Device.And Hell lot of Bugs .
Voice call quality  is not good enough , you will feel the vibrations on your ears which makes it really difficult  to understand a simple conversation.
Battery drains drastically.
Some features does not respond as expected.
Expecting Samsung India to come up with proper updates.
I tried to replace this device with some other phone or asking for the refund ,but the customer care provides me with policy change bullshit, though we have an option for replace or refund option in the Amazon App.
I scheduled  a technician check up with the customer care on 27.06.2019 but it was rescheduled  to 28.06.2019 without the concern of the user.
Amazon India has been really degrading  their status and customer service and new policies now after being the No.1 Internet BRAND in India

not at all as expected
battery (4000mah) finished from morning 10 30 to evening  7 pm
had to charge again
my old A5 2017 (3000mah) lasted all day
and charger cord is third grade less than a meter
and thin like a cheap Rs 50 cord

Lookwise and Operation wise superb phone.. Operates smoothly with sanpdragon.. Display is awesome specially with lighting around front camera... holding in hand gives super premium feeling.. I didn't like the camera quality at all.. bokeh effect pathetic even in full day light... low light photgraphy at night not upto the mark... Except camera outstanding phone...

After 7 days of use... Notification a big problem. You can't even turn off.. I get some useless notification 3-4 times in a day and there is no option to turn off.. Can Samsung Justify why you don't give option to turn off???

Plz avoid buying ....
1 ) you might not hear the voice clearly, or you might hear echoes, crackling from the other side. 2) phone is heating up very badly...

My suggestion  is Company has to recall all these phones, or else it impact on entire brand. All users facing issues mainly call, if it's basic functionality  of the  call voice not working,  keeping the is waste.. samsung has to recall the phone and repay the money, if not repaying  the money to users it impacts entire  Samsung brand, users never buy the mobiles in Amazon.

This is the worst phone in my life.There is nothing to like in it. Everything is going to dislike.
Some important thing for dislike.:-
1. Battery life only 5 to 6 hours
2.heating problem(You can not talk continuously)
3. Screen sound is very worst things

There are many more dislikes that, we do not have any time to explain it.

Pros :
Camera is good .
Both selfie and rear cam.

Cons :
Fast charging doesn't help.
Fast charging takes more time .doesn't look like fast charging.
Too much of heating issues.
For this spec, atleat 4500 mah battery would be required.

Yet to install games like clash royals n pubg

Hope to have further updates

Initial Review - Phone look very nice, lightweight, finger sensors are very fast to recognise, phone is working very smooth and fast. Charging is good too.

Cons
  - Picture quality is not upto the mark from Camera, it's not crisp looks smudged which is Trend in most Android phones I think, but good enough, Wide angle works nicely.
  - It works on Indian Sim only, which is a big drawback for me, may be not for others.

Will update more review while I use the phone.

SIM tray not opening, without SIM it is everything but a phone.
So called "On screen" speaker is pathetic. Sound quality used to be much better in earlier mobiles.
Camera is average. You might say that for this price don't expect more than this. But then why triple camera. Even single camera would have given if not better then same results.

Poor build quality.  Pasting  of back panel is not proper . Earpiece sound is also too low and not audible  in traffic . Receiver  also can't hear my voice  hence the mic  is even downgraded I'm  forced to give  single star else it's worth minus rating . Very disappointed  by Samsung  quality  a very old customer  since 2008.

M40 Mobile is awesome. I have usee iphone 6 and 7 and moto g5s plus. As compare to those phone M40 is better in look and quality. Plastic uses for phone is good and its dual Volte means we can use two JIO sims at same time. 32MP camera is decent. Selfie camera is also good. Battery also perform good. Screen of phone should be little wide needes. I ordered and got seawater color whoc is a different color and looks ao nice. Its sceen is working as earpiece speaker means they have not given and mesh for listening its screen is working like ear speaker. You can listen the voice of other person from screen from holding phone from middle or below. Whole screen is working like speaker.

It's a pathetic phone, please don't buy this.
Call quality is poor, battery life is poor, it is heating is too much. Waste of money. Please don't buy. It's like wasting 20k. You will be much happier with another phone of lesser price. If normal quality can't be maintained don't pay the price of buying this.the phone is not returnable. You have to bear with a pathetic phone. Beware

Overall the phone is good but call quality is super poor. Impossible to hear in crowded areas, very low clarity and low sound. Only easy to listen is via earphones. So unless you have the ears of a dog, don't buy this phone.

Lousy product and lousy after sales service by Amazon. Pls don't buy, just bought a new mobile m40 and the sim slot is jammed and doesn't open. On calling Amazon I was enlightened  that the guy attending to my call is the final authority and that I can't put me.on to anybody higher up.( this is on record). He suggested that they merely sell products and any defect is not their responsibility. He offered a solution that a technician will visit me 5 days later check the device and then draw up a story, post that they may replace the product. And beware there is no refund. Such pathetic service, they are taking us for a royal ride. He went on to say that they only promote products and give two hoots of what quality that product is off. So anybody who bought this..your problemo, you have been conned.

Not at all upto the mark, I never write negative reviews, probably first negative review I am writing, I gifted it to my wife on her bday, she did not like this phone at all and purchased the new one, the selfie quality is extremely bad, battery life is not at all good, no option to capture screenshot using three fingers, the screenshot functionality is very complex! This phone not worth 20k, I am extremely disappointed as she have used it just for 3-4 days and purchased a new oppo phone. I know amazon cannot do anything but it's my suggestion to everyone to not to buy any new launched phone until it is oppo, vivo, oneplus or redmi. Worst ever decision to invest my money on this phone as it proved to be worst ever gift I gifted to my wife.

I bought the Samsung Galaxy M40 after careful deliberation and research. I wanted the latest cutting edge features and best configuration possible in my restricted budget of 20K. Below are my detailed observations regarding the features that make the Samsung M40 stand head and shoulders above any similar phone in the same price bracket. Many of these features were earlier only available on flagship phones at twice the cost and I feel Samsung has aggressively and effectively shattered the glass ceiling on budget phones with the premium feature packed M40. I will also try to provide detailed insight and my practical first hand experience with the M40's features while using it. I hope it helps you in getting a comprehensive in-depth understanding of the features.

Looks, Feel and Functionality:

● Infinity-O Display : M40 is the first Smart phone in this price range to feature the Infinity-O display which was only available in the flagship S10 series till now. This feature enables an expanded screen size with a screen-to-body ratio greater than 91% with FHD+ resolution by minimising the bezel even further, thereby providing a larger screen size without actually increasing the size of the phone. In fact the M40 has the thinnest bezel in the Galaxy M range. The uninterrupted mesmerising edge-to-edge experience actually makes the display look bigger than the phone you're holding in your hand.

● Punch hole front camera : The infinity-O display provides the solution to create a cut-out in the upper corner in which the Selfie camera is discreetly tucked away, accurately placed while maximising screen real estate and maintaining the larger screen-to-body ration with the minuscule almost-bezel-less display. This is not distracting at all unlike the previous in-your face notch in the center and I felt it is really a great unobtrusive placement which lets you forget it's there till you use the front-cam. Again this punch hole design was previously featured on the S10 series and till now was a flagship phone feature.

● Qualcomm 6xx series 2Ghz Octa-Core Snapdragon 675 with Adreno 612 GPU : This is the first M series phone featuring this latest 6xx Qualcomm 675 Snapdragon processor which has previously only been used in flagship phones. Simply put this processor super-powers the M40 for smooth, reliable and steady performance. It makes the M40 blistering fast with negligible app load times and allows brisk multi-tasking with numerous app loaded without any lag or delays. I felt the entire usage experience breezy, swift and snappy. The Adreno 612 GPU in combination with the processor handles the most graphics-intensive games comfortable without any slowdown or jitters that I could notice in games like Pubg and Asphalt 9 with its default setting of HD and High frame rate.

● Triple Rear Camera Setup: The Samsung M40 comes with the best and latest in class combination on its cameras. The triple camera combination is more advanced than the M30 with its 32 MP primary lens which clicks pictures in really great clarity and detail and its f/1.7 aperture offers flexibility to get good shots in low light. It also features a 5 MP depth sensor with f/2.2 aperture for amazing portrait snaps and I've takes some of the most vivid pictures of my daughters with the M40 already. It also features an 8 MP ultra wide-angle lens with f/2.2 with 123 degree field of view for excellent reproduction while capturing landscape shots. The front camera is a huge 16 mp Selfie and video calling camera with vibrant results and the above combination is a first for the Samsung M series. The camera also features Slow Motion, Ultra Slow Motion, Hyper Lapse and video recording at the industry latest 4K quality. The M40 also features an AI based scene optimiser which gives outstanding results and sublimely attractive photographs. Focus locks quite fast and daylight shots are crisp and vibrant with colours quite close to real life optics.

● Wide vine L1 and Dolby Atmos : One of the most under rated but beneficial feature in this time and age of online streaming is the strangely unknown Wide vine L1 certification that the Samsung M40 has. It is one of the rare phones which is certified and will stream popular streaming videos from Netflix, Amazon Prime and Google play in true HD quality. Most phones do not feature or advertise this and simply provide non-hd content even on their HD or 4K supported phones. Definite plus for me as I spend a lot of time streaming movies and binging on show and find the true-HD experience awesome. Dolby Atmos brings cinema quality surround sound and was previously engineered on Flagship phones and increases the audio/visual experience even for gaming.

● On Screen sound technology : The M40 introduces the ground breaking futuristic On-Screen sound technology in the M40. The speaker is placed below the display effectively turning the entire display into a virtual speaker. This provides the benefit of saving speaker space thereby increasing the screen size and reducing the bezel further. The phone still needs to be placed in the normal position on the ear for best results and calling is crisp and clear in my experience when done so. This also translates into no speaker slot and grill to get clogged or damaged owing to daily use which is a nifty advantage for me.

● Android Pie and OneUi : This is the first Samsung Device which features latest version Android Pie pre-installed ready to use right out of the box. The M40 runs on the OneUI which is Samsung's custom software based on the android 9.0 Pie update. The user interface comes loaded with a minimalistic design which is optimised for a smooth and simple user experience with tons of customisations that can be done. There is a system wide Night Mode, support for dual messenger and some nifty gesture based navigation controls and the UI really makes one-handed usage easier. Pre-installed apps can be uninstalled but most are useful.

More Highlights, Features and Functionalities :

● The Samsung M40 has a 6.3 inches FHD+ capacitive touchscreen with Corning Gorilla Glass protection.
● At 7.9mm thickness combined with 168 gms weight in hand it is really lightweight and ergonomically designed.
● Featuring 6 GB ram with 128 GB storage capacity expandable to 512 GB it takes care of all your speed and storage requirements.
● Features Dual Hybrid sim slots for flexibility. Allows you to use 2 sim cards simultaneously or to expand storage using SD Card.
●  Has 3500mah optimised Lithium-ion battery which easily give you a day's backup with around 20% left at the end of the day if you have heavy usage like me or a day and a half's backup if you have moderate usage.
● Good anti-glare visibility under sunlight owing to its 480 Nits brightness.
● Incorporates facial recognition for unlocking along with fingerprint scanner built into the back which is snappy and fast.
● Other sensors available on the M40 include Accelerometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Hall Sensor, Proximity Sensor and Virtual Light Sensing.
● The M40 Comes with a 15W fast charger which takes around 1.5 hours to charge phone to full.
● The M40 does away with the 3.5mm headphone slot and provides the future ready slimmer Type C earphones in box. The provided high quality earphones have crystal clear and crisp output and provide good immersive music experience.
● The M40 has had a bundled launch with loads of network offers which you can benefit from, including savings of 3110/- on Jio Galaxy Club with its double data offer, or get 100% more data upto 840 GB for 10 months on Airtel or Vodafone Cashback worth 3750/- on 50 recharge vouchers of 75/- each along with 250 GB data with additional 0.5 data for upto 18 months.
● The Company provides 1 year manufacturer warranty for phone and 6 months warranty for accessories in box from date of purchase.

Downsides:

● Samsung could have tried to squeeze in a bigger battery and it could have been a phone lasting 2 days.
● There should be more colour options even in metallic finishes or a size variant.
● Really need more options for protective accessories.
● Samsung could have worked on IPS certification and made the phone waterproof.

The Samsung M40 is a beautifully crafted mobile which looks both premium and elegant. The dark Blue hue with a gradient finish across the back of the panel blending into a seemingly lighter blue colour on the curved edges gives it a dual tone effect, making it look strikingly smart and sleek. The deadly combination of stunning looks with it's innovative and latest advancements and novelty features make the M40 quite a pleasure to own and use and in my opinion makes it one of the best budget smartphones under 20k.

This is waste of money.  I got a  defective product with camera lens broken.  Still didn't got replacement. Please don't buy this. Battery life is very short. Discharge in just 2 hrs.

Requested for inspection.

Technician was rude. Instead of resolving the problem he began to convince me that I damaged my phone.  Why would I do that?.

He updated that there is no issue with my phone and that everything is okay.

When I contacted him and asked the same,  he began to use abusive language.  I told him that I requested for another inspection.  Then he threatened me that he would make sure that I will never get a replacement .

His name is  Madhu Cholleti
Phone number is  9494604371

Phone looks good.  That's all.
Its screen does not get brighten when call is received.
Callers number and name do not appear on the screen but they appear at 'Notification Bar'.
On screen speaker vibrate a lot.
The caller's voice quality is very poor and at times one cannot understand what the caller is saying.
Before I could not down the PROS in the phone, its CONS disappointed me a lot and I decided to return the phone.
Such poor quality product is not expected from the house of Samsung.

The Worst Phone ever....it has a big big big Heat issue......very low low battery life.......i played pubj for just 15 minute and i have to leave the game in mid way...because the screen is likely to burn my thumb....please guys dont buy this.....and yes the screen sound cast technology is just f***

The Worst phone I have ever purchased. The on-screen ear piece technology vibrates my ears and make the ear painful along with Heating issue. IMAGINE: Its like keeping your ears on the Hot Iron box. Can't able to hear the voice and the Selfie camera is very poor. I would not recommend this phone even to my Enemy.

The design is good and sleek and the phone feels light too but I really miss the 3.5 mm audio Jack. The in box earphones sound good but feel quite cheap.
The fingerprint sensor being a conventional one is fast and can also be used to swipe down/up the notification panel.

The UI is quite good and smooth and also includes the dark/night mode which I really love. I increased the animation speed to 0.5x from developer settings which I usually use.

The rear triple camera setup is just okay. You can get 32mp only in one mode and in that too pictures are not very clear. Although the front camera is quite good and can take pictures in portrait mode too. Before this, I was using MIA1 and I feel the rear camera of my 2 year old phone was better than this one. I just hope that the camera improved with future updates as the hardware is very capable and just needs a bit of software tweaks. I've seen in YouTube videos that you can install gcam directly which gives better photos .

The battery is just okay and would harely last a day with moderate usage. It give a screen on time of around 4 hrs.

For gamers, don't expect very high performance. For smooth running of PUBG, You will have to reduce the graphic settings. I didn't play any other game.

The phone does not have an earpiece and instead uses some kind of screen vibration technology to produce sound.

The display is just okay and you will face difficulty reading in open. The punch hole camera looks great and gives a premium look to the phone.

You can get it for 19k using the bank offers.
If you want a very premium looking smartphone with very good UI and a trustworthy brand but can compromise on battery and display(M30 gets a sAMOLED display at a lower price) go for it.

Overall 7/10

Not worth the hard earned money
Software,  camera and performance do not add up to the specs.

Update after I got the replacement - Teplacement has the same issue that I had before.  Time to sue samsung

Update after 5 days of usage - In display speaker is a big issue. Phone vibrates while speaking; voice from the other side not clear at all.
Biggest issue - The phone screen will not turn on to notify when some one calls. I will have to manually unlock the device, swipe down from notifications in order to see who is calling me. This is a big pain given that I travel a lot and cannot afford to unlock my phone just to see who is calling me. Batter life continues to be below par.

Having switched from Iphone 6 to Samasung M40 was a pleasure and smooth experience. I don't feel I am missing my Iphone any more.

PROS:
1. Screen is really huge and very bright.
2. Viewing angles are good.
3. The feel of the polycarbonate body is really great. Feels like a premium phone.
4. Having NFC is a gread deal.
5. Samasung has done a great job with OneUI. Its fluid smooth.
6. Performace wise this phone is one of tge top having Snapdragon 675. Doesn't heat up at all with average usage.
7. The phone is light weight and form factor is also good.
8. Both front and rear camera take good shots, offers a bunch of features like wide angle shot, slowmo, hyperlapse etc.
9. Pubg, NFS, Asphalt games running like butter. Didn' observe any lag till now.

CONS:
1. Till  now I have felt only the battery backup is the concern. Feel like if battery was of 4000mah this would have been great. Though I guess this phone can last 1.5 days with average usage after full charge.

CONCLUSION:
I bet anyone will be amazed by the design and feel of the phone at this price. Really a great deal. Cameras do a great job. Dolby atmos really packs power to your entertainment. ONEUI experience is fluid and one can fall in love with way its designed.

I got the Seawater Blue variant of this phone &amp; after using it, here's what I found:

The Basics

The Aesthetics:
I got the seawater blue &amp; it's the most gorgeous blue phone I've ever seen. It has an iridescent hue, a glossy, opalescent finish &amp; an overall ombre effect. It is prone to scratches &amp; fingerprints so best used with a case. It looks stylish &amp; catchy even with a clear phone case.

The Screen:
It's a 6.3in crisp &amp; vibrant display with saturated colors. There's a hole notch for the 32MP camera, but it doesn't get in the way. It's big enough but still easy to navigate. It's easy on the eyes &amp; doesn't cause eye strain like LED displays. It's comfortable to view indoors as well as outdoors as it gradually adapts to the ambient light levels.

The Weight:
It's quite light for a phone of this size, weighing 168 grams, doesn't feel bulky in the hand.

The Camera:
Though there's no image stabilization &amp; pictures taken in darkness don't turn out very well, it does very well in natural light, 4K recording and Super Slow-mo video recording. Pet pictures turn out especially good.

The Software:
Intuitive &amp; minimalistic user interface with less bloatware that's more manageable by zipping unused apps.

The Audio:
The screen sound tech feels quite different as it subtly vibrates when the person's talking at the other end. The voices sound a bit different too, slightly hollow; which you get used to after a while. The max call volume is lower than usual.

It doesn't have a regular earphone jack which leaves you with 3 options - to use type C earphones, wireless ones or use with an adapter.

The Battery Life:

A charge in the morning lasts a whole day on average usage. Also owing to the fast charging feature, it takes about an hour and a half to charge completely.

So what's it like to be a daily user of this phone?

It always looks refreshingly sleek &amp; appealing. As you pick it up to use, it unlocks in a jiffy via face recognition or as you instinctively place your finger over the back sensor (as in subconsciously). Then you check your notifications or your usual routine, switching between apps seamlessly without any stutter. Apps launch quickly, the interface is smooth, and the phone doesn't get too hot when running simple chat and social apps. You'll be good for media consumption on it's huge display. All in all it's up for the task.

IMHO
 If you are looking to buy a solid, mid-range smartphone that offers a large display for watching videos, has a decent camera and looks stylish, the M40 is worth considering. It's also great for people who's primary use is checking emails, social media &amp; browsing youtube. Good looks &amp; performance makes it an attractive option at this price point.

I'm a Samsung loyalist, have used almost all premium phones from Samsung, and out of that trust, i bought as well, but was shocked to know, its just a MESSED out of what could have been a very good phone, and the blunder in this one is On-Screen sound technology.. Everything is damn good, but a phone is not a phone if it don't let u speak over voice calls, and on that aspect this phone simple defeat the very purpose of a mobile is made for.

I tried getting it replaced/return withing 10 days return period, but amazon also took their hands off, their executive told me clearly, that if i cant speak on phone then i should accept that this was was not made for this purpose, which was really hilarious and disappointing on part of amazon, and finally after using it for 7 days i was forced to sell this off in local market for 4k less and saved my remaining 16k, as i bought it for 20k sometime back..

so anyone willing to buy this, its a BIG BIG NOOOOOOOOO from a samsung loyalist as well

Smartphone feels smooth in touch and in operating,  battery life needs to charge if used for prolong time and take about 15-20 minutes for charging it in normal state , by the way who wants to spend whole day and night with phone lol M40 is light weight ,it does help in gaming for entertainment purposes then throw it aside not to get addicted to games. Camera is good , finger print touch unlock is very quick I didn't find any lag if I find any problem with this I'll update , there is Dolby Atmos use wireless bluetooth earbuds move around keeping phone at one place good range of bluetooth,  when phone is locked there is screensaver of glance showing different information good for learning new things without searching, overall above average below premium level.

Built quality, Camera result and performance is good as expected, it offers an Infinity-O display that is unique to this segment, a Snapdragon 675 chipset and a 32MP triple camera setup. But it also lacks an AMOLED display and a headphone jack. Overall worth for Money...

It is a very good looking phone.  But the only problem is the battery and we have to purchase the type c to 3.5 MM jack adapter  .the camera is good with super slow and slow motion mode and in front camera there is a wide mode too . And I think it is a very good phone . I think it is better than a50 because it gets in display finger print which is extremely slow and irritating.

This is in reference to Samsung M40 i have received on 22nd june
Firstly There is white spot on the camera Front camera .
Secondly if we are paying such a high amount of almost 20k should we expect a quality that is Good or superior than the predecessor M30
But its not .

This is really very disappointing that a premium brand like samsung is sending a New defective products .
This is really very annoying , and certainly i have changed my decision and i dont  want this product anymore and please hardly request change my model also M40
Say M30
Other wise I’m go to consumer count

Please Assist accordingly

Thanks and Regards

Overall it's a good phone in this budget but major issues are, it has LCD Display so the sharpness of images is poor as compared to the 32MP camera, secondly- removing ear piece and using Screen Sound Technology is the worst thing...Volume during calls is too low and you can't hear properly, so it's the worst thing you can have in this phone. Also battery drains little faster as compared to other phones. It's good to buy but could be much more better !

Included with features like Qualcomm processor, a triple-rear camera setup, and Infinity-O display, Samsung Galaxy M40 is just at Rs. 19,990. Yet, is it any great? Go through to ready my complete review.
A little while back, on June 11, Samsung launched its fourth cellphone in the current Galaxy M series, named the Samsung Galaxy M40.
Performance and One UI of Samsung Galaxy M40
In the Galaxy M40, Samsung has given Qualcomm's prevalent Snapdragon 675 SoC. The equivalent was additionally included in Galaxy A70, and M40 is the 2nd cell phone for Samsung to utilize the chipset. It comes with 128GB of internal storage and 6GB of RAM. The smartphone has hybrid SIM slot, which states you can either utilize one SIM card with a microSD card or two SIM cards (Nano-SIM+Nano-SIM).
With regards to operation, the Galaxy M40 functions admirably in dealing with everyday works or even perform heavy various tasks. During my review, I didn't discover any stutter or lag. The Samsung Galaxy M40 is first M series smartphone come running Android 9 Pie-based OneUI. M series smartphones had Experience UI 9.5 and Android 8.1 Oreo in the past. So, it's a much-needed development. Most recent OneUI of Samsung is one the great Android overlay currently, and it functioned smooth as well. I discovered couple of missing features in the UI, which are available on Samsung's marginally premium cellphones. In the Galaxy M40, you can neither alter the presentation tone and nor do you have two taps to wake gesture. I am not certain, if Samsung, purposefully, left out those features.
Going to the gaming on the Samsung Galaxy M40, the prominent high-graphic PUBG functioned good. By default, it happens on high-graphic settings. I didn't discover edge drops, the smartphone didn't warm much while long sessions and there was next to no load time. You can be rest guaranteed of different gaming performance also. Generally speaking, the processor and software mix functions extraordinary on the Samsung Galaxy M40.
Design and Punch-hole display of Samsung Galaxy M40
The Galaxy M40 is first reasonable smartphone by Samsung to offer punch-hole display. As I would like to say, it's the best style I've ever seen from Samsung in quite a while. The mobile fits and feels extremely brilliant in hands. This smartphone is very lightweight and I wouldn't fret the polycarbonate body over the metal or glass, if that holds the weight within proper limits.

Upfront, you get a 6.3-inch full-HD+ TFT LCD Infinity-O or punch-hole display, which is bright and pleasant. The viewing angles, color reproduction, and touch response are satisfactory on this presentation. The bottom chin and bezels are genuinely negligible, and doesn't look bad. Additionally, the front camera punch-hole is exceptionally minor, and the general style and design resembles an excellent flagship mobile.
Curiously, the Samsung Galaxy M40 is first ever cell phone to utilize "On Screen Sound" innovation. It means that there is no earpiece grill; and rather the whole display twice up as the speaker for voice calls. Sadly, it is not good innovation to be completely frank, in light of the fact that makes mild vibration and it doesn't feel great when you keep the ear close. Likewise, the result doesn't come comparable to the conventional speaker result. Having said that, it is as yet operational however you'll experience difficulties hearing in to the individual available on a call-in noisy environment.
Battery performance, Fingerprint sensor and Face Unlock of Samsung Galaxy M40
The Samsung Galaxy M40 packs a 3,500mAh battery with USB Type-C and 15W quick charging help. While I was writing my review, the battery backup of M40 was generally useful for the whole day. My utilization example can be contemplated as better than expected, however not incredibly high. It incorporated maps navigation, web surfing, social media apps, bit of video surfing, and web surfing. The mobile doesn't warm much and the battery doesn't get depleted too rapidly while navigating. I additionally observed the battery charging to be sensibly great, however not so quick. It for the most part took around 1 hour 45 minutes to completely charge the mobile from 0 to 100.
Samsung gives a face unlock and physical unique finger impression scanner feature on the Galaxy M40. I observed the unique finger impression scanner to be somewhat irritable. The face acknowledgment is additionally very quick, yet at the same time opens with eyes-shut, which should be fixed for all Samsung cell phones.
Camera Performance of Samsung Galaxy M40
Like Galaxy A70, the Galaxy M40 packs a 3-camera lens setup at the back. It comprises of a 32-megapixel primary sensor with a f/1.7 aperture, a secondary 8-megapixel ultra-wide (123 degree) angle lens with f/2.2, and a 5-megapixel f/2.2 sensor for depth. Unfortunately, there is no Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), yet you can make video up to 4K at 30fps and 720p slow motion video-recordings at 240fps.
I observed the camera of Samsung Galaxy M40 to be not too bad generally during my review. It would work well for you in many situations, particularly in sunlight. The camera adjusts saturation, high dynamic range (HDR), and colors great. The sunshine shots had great focus sharpness, however sadly passed up on finer details.
This setup in any case works admirably and scene optimizer mode improves the result somewhat more for your preferring. On Galaxy M40, the 123-degrees ultra-wide-angle lens functions admirably, and the company has resolved the fish-eye impact problem. You can take enormous gathering shots or greater scene than any cell phone camera available in this cost.
The Galaxy M40 utilizes a 16-megapixel f/2.0 lens for the front selfie camera, which is being placed on left corner of the display. It is very small and doesn't appear diverting on the display. Discussing its function, it captures great selfies and keeps the natural skin-tone. The 'Live Focus' bokeh mode gives you a chance to set the blur intensity, however the edge recognition isn't good.
Should you purchase Samsung Galaxy M40?
As I would like to say, the Samsung Galaxy M40 is one of the best mobiles in this cost. The mobile provides most recent punch-hole display, a modern style and an adequately ground-breaking processor for Rs 19,990. The camera experience is not the most powerful in its cost, however genuinely great in general. The smartphone is an enjoyment for gaming users. What it doesn’t have is a 3.5mm audio port; however, Samsung gives USB Type-C earphones in the box. Be that as it may, I would even now call the Galaxy M40 a decent blend of software and hardware from Samsung, which didn't give me a chance to miss having a flagship mobile.

Camera quality is not up to mark, looking the pics on a big screen will help you realise the pixalation.
The USB-C to Aux converter should have been provided or at least the one that can be used for this mobile, as the headphones came along with the package sucks and when I tried multiple other USBC to Aux converters none of them got detected. These are the basic requirements.
The in screen speaker is also not good, loudness, as if u hear a sound bar very close to your ear, low frequency distortion, poor sound quality when talking on phones are issues.

I had purchased the device on first day flash sale from Amazon. Thanks Amazon for the speed delivery. Phone looks good in the starting and after five days got the hanging issue once. So, I tried to reboot the device, but I got the error screen and and device not re-booted. After couple of minutes, I selected some option from the error screen and then only app got rebooted successfully. I am very much disappointed after seeing the error screen n 5 days of usage.

Samsung finally has hit the sweet spot. This device has everything you need. It has the punchole display, a wide angle camera, Snapdragon 675 processor and so on. What more do you want in a mid-range smartphone.

I would trust Samsung any given day than Mi and those other companies who are currently making mid-range smartphones.

The battery backup is good and it lasts throughout the day. Plus fast changing saves a lot of time. This display is by far the best display I've come across on a phone. The Colors are great and it's nice to watch content on it.

Overall a very good mid-range smartphone. Recommended.

One of the worst mobile one can purchase in this price Range. Some of the worst things about this mobile are:
1. Extremely poor rear camer ,something that u can't expect from samsung. May be to reduce d cost they used inferior quality camera this time.
2. Headphone Jack is C type, hence u won't be able to play ur favourite music with ur regular headphone.
3. Display is not S Amoled. Hence, it looks very baad and hurts ur eyes after long uses.
4. Full screen is not supported for most of the apps hence the inbuilt camera looks like an ordinary camera while using.
5. Plastic body of inferior quality
6. Gets heated up after prolonged uses.
7. It hangs after normal use.
8. Battery drains fast and is only 3500Mah

After using 4 days i am writing this review..

Pros..
1. Phone is light weight and looks pretty ( girlish)
2. Display is unlike 20k range phones, its superb immersive , You can't compare even with 30k range smartphones
3. Camera's ultra wide angle mode is very impressive covers almost our entire view angle.

Cons..
1. Charging cable is too short , hardly it will reach upto your bed and table from socket.
2 Back camera quality is average and selfie camera needs lots of improvements. Image quality is too poor.
3. Battery is average 1 day on normal use.
4. Biggest issue with phone is notification and charging led indicator absence. You can only get to know you notification by turning diaplay on &amp; no sign while phone is charging.
5.Ear piece volume while call is not like open speakers, low sound.
6.Screen bleeding issue around hole punch and side edges of diaplay.
7. Charging is not so quick it takes almost average time to charge.

Pros:
1. Design.
2. Speed and Processor.
3. Brand.

Cons:
1. Poor Camera quality.
2. Fast charging doesn’t help. Takes almost 1hr 50mins to full charge.
3. On screen sound technology is poor. Feels hollow sound while on call.
4. Automatic brightness doesn’t work well.

I retuned it after using nearly 1week. Thanks to amazon they took it back though I had to struggle a lot in complaining, conducting amazon technician visit at home and lot of follow ups.

Reviewing after using it for 5 months.

Hardware
Option of  4/6 GB RAM with 128GB storage sufficeint for normal usage.
Comes with Snapdragon 675, certainly gives edge over the other M-series sets which use Exynos.

Camera
Rear - Comes with tripple camera setup, 32MP main camera, 8MP wide angle plus 5MP depth sensor.
Front - 16MP Punch hole camera.

Software
Comes with android 9 out of the box.
Samsung one UI is really good.

Battery
3500mAh

Pros.
1. Design is really sleek and good. Using sea water blue colored handset and it really looks premium.
2. Has around 85% screen to body ratio with 409ppi screen which make its looks stunning.
3. Punch hole camera (one of the main feature USP) which is still not offered by most of the brands at this price point. I personally prefer punch hole over notch which occupies more screen.
4. No ear piece (another innovation). The call sound comes from screen and it didn't  trouble me as some other users have reviewed it.
5. Snapdragon 675 chipset.
6. Has a good wide angle camera that takes decent photos.
7. Comes with a 15Watt fast charging type C and completely charges your phone in just over an hour.
8. Bundled with type C earphones.
9. Games like PUBG and Asphalt runs just fine without any lag.
10. No heating issues. Normal heating while charging.
11. Speaker is quite clear and adequately loud.

Cons.
1. Camera setup is bulging out of the body(which is with most of the phones nowadays), it is susceptible to scratches. Mine got cracked within a month. Will advice you to use a good back cover.
2. Back is just glossy plastic which not only makes it slippery but is a scratch magnet. Glass is expected at this price point.
3. TFT screen, while the lower priced M 30 offers the sAMOLED. So it misses out the "Always on" display. Maybe samsung was not willing to give the premium S series feature punch hole + sAMOLED display in this though they could have reduced the PPI. There are no options to change the color saturation also.
4. Camera is not that great but not bad also. Just stands average. Fine with normal day to day photography.
5. Battery backup is below average. Barely lasts for an entire day. One of the main reasons is TFT screen.
6. Misses out the 3.5mm earphone jack and not all type C to 3.5mm connector works for the phone due to some codec compatibility.
7. Hybrid sim2/microSD slot but extended storage won't be required for most of the users.
8. Fingerprint unlock could have been a little faster.
9. Face unlock works even with the closed eyes.
10. The is some color tinge on the screen around the punch hole camera and the bottom.
11. Punch hole camera occupies more space on screen as compared to latest S and note series but there's a lot of price difference also.

Disclaimer: This is a layman review after 2 day use.

Rating: 4.5 stars (rounded off to 5)

Right of the bat let me just say that this is a marvellous phone! I have just ONE complaint and barring that, I would say this is the best in the market currently for this price.

Let me start with what I consider the only con with this device - the call quality. How can Samsung get this wrong, I wonder. I had read this in a couple of reviews but glossed over it assuming it can’t be true. Turns out, there IS some issue with the call quality- there is always some vibration sound which although not very discernible, exists. But here is why this particular problem doesn’t affect me- I am always on handsfree either with Bluetooth or an earphone and so all my calls are routed via one of them and I get crystal clear clarity in both minus the vibration sound. It is only when I talk with the handset which is very very rare does the Zzzzzzzz set in. Not to say it affects the call clarity per se – you can hear the other side crystal clear- but it is annoying as hell. I had my mother use it and she did not find the vibration thingy irritating so I guess it may not be a universal thing. Either case if you use the earphone/headphone/Bluetooth/speaker then you won’t face the problem but if you are entirely reliant on the handset then this can be a deal breaker.

Now coming to the things I loved: Too many to list so I will keep it short.

Firstly the look and feel is very premium. It feels more like a luxury segment phone than a budget phone. The seawater blue cover is breathtaking and unique.

Amazing display. Everything looks sharp and clear.

The camera is a joy to take pics with! Not sure why some reviews diss the camera quality- I found it pretty awesome.

The battery seems decent. Could have been better but I have charged it only once these last 2 days and it is still going strong with average use.

Last word: Samsung doesn’t disappoint. Just wish the call quality was minus the vibration effect. Rest all perfect.

It's been 3-4 days since I'm using this phone and my overall experience is pathetic... first of all the voice quality during the call is very bad you barely listen when you are on call, secondly the battery life of this phone is worse, though it has 3500 mAh battery it's drains out so fastly and sometimes phone overheat...
Don't recommend anyone to buy this phone and waste your money...

So I purchased this product when a friend talked highly about this new phone in the market. Well, I must say I had my differences when it came down to mobile phone brands but I must say after this all-new M40 from Samsung I am reconsidering my choice in brands.

The notable features that this phone has besides the very basic features are:
1. It has a beautiful Infinity O display with a near bezel-free experience with a water drop notch.
2. It has a mind-blowing speed because of its Snapdragon 675 processor.
3. 32 MP+ 8 MP+ 5 MP TRIPLE CAMERA! And that too with 4k recording. Like wow!
4. This phone has brought the notch up by introducing On Screen Sound technology where the sound is emitted from within phone and below the screen. This definitely upgrades the bezel-free experience.
5. Also, it’s Android Pie! And guess what's more impressive? It has NIGHT MODE!
6. The best thing about this phone is it has got a Widevine L1 certification which lets you stream FULL HD content on any streaming networks. Oh and the Midnight Blue looks just so good.
7. It has whooping internal storage of 128gb which again is expandable.
8. And if you love to spend a really lot of time on your phone but at the same time keep worrying about a charging port nearby, this might be your ultimate phone of long battery life.
9. It also has features like Device care, Data saving, Digital wellbeing, Panic mode, Dual Messenger and many more options to explore.
10. It has got a very fast fingerprint sensor on the rear and a Face unlock system as well.

The best sleek, good performance and brilliant display you can get at this budget. Like what else could I have asked for at this price?

Samsung M40 is a premium phone with stylish looks, manufactured under ‘Make in India’ initiative which is sure to turn many heads. However, this phone is typically meant to use in India and can be activated only via Indian SIM cards. The highlights of the product are detailed as follows:

1) Quite Lightweight with Premium Looks – M40 is very light to hold onto and got a premium feel to it due to the sleek design. It is perfect for any occasion and would merge with any fashion statement. The seawater colour looks awesome and it got a unique double tone effect which will charm you up every now and then.

2) Excellent Display with Thin Bezels – The display of the phone is excellent and outperforms any smartphone device I have held onto, till date. The ultra-thin bezels and high screen-to-body ratio make justice to the same. FHD videos on the phone look very detailed that other FHD screens and with time the punch hole camera will not bother you much; rather you will think it as a ‘bindi’ which beautifies your phone.

3) Lightning Fast Fingerprint Sensor – The fingerprint sensor to unlock the device or apps works almost instantly as it is ultra-fast. The face unlock, on the other hand, is not that fast and will not work quite well if the hand-face coordination is not there.

4) Fast Charging with Good Battery Backup – The charging of the M40 is quite fast and it typically charges 1% of the battery in less than a minute, thanks to the USB-C port. I have charged the phone from around 20% to 80% in roughly about 50 minutes. The battery backup on the phone is quite good, too.

5) Average Camera Performance with Front Screen Flash – The camera of the phone works quite well but I have termed it average solely due to the hype it creates on the triple camera setup. I have, however, on particular occasions felt that the picture output is not entirely crispy as it should be with the smartphone these days. Although there is no physical front flash, the screen flash works well in low light conditions for a selfie. The selfie camera works well in normal lighting conditions.

6) Below Average Ear Speaker – The phone’s most hyped screen speaker (meant for talking over the phone) is sadly below average. I have had not got used to it yet and use headphones for phone calls. Other speakers, for loudspeakers or music playback, works like charm.

7) Butter flow Performance with Apps, Minor lags with PUBG – Any apps I have used on this phone works like a charm without any issues, whatsoever. PUBG starts almost instantly and continues flawlessly for about half an hour while it starts to lag a bit. A quick restart will easily fix it, so, there should have been an option in the Game Launcher which would clear cache and optimize the phone for the game without the need to close the particular game.

8) Unitive UI but Yearns for more Feature – The UI of the phone is very crystal clear and all the similar used settings are packed in unison. However, very basic features, like, displaying connection speed, LED notifications, or even IR blaster are something we expect in our smartphone these days.

9) No Headphone Jack but USB-C Headphones Included – The 3.5mm headphone jack is missing to make in line with the classy design of the phone. Samsung thus provides with USB-C headphone which is quite good for music playback as well as phone calls. However, it would have been a bright idea on the part of the brand to provide with USB-C to 3.5mm connector, instead of a headphone which would ensure that all our previous headphones can be used with this phone.

10) Indian Warranty Only – In this era of globalization, it is very hard to think that a multinational brand like Samsung offers an only local country warranty. I am honestly very disappointed at this approach from once a market leader.

M40 has its own charm and definitely, a phone one would like to own. I have been quite satisfied with the buy due to its overall performances, so far.

Samsung has launched its M series phones 6 months ago and we have seen some of the best in class budget phones in the m series. Now with this M40, Samsung has leveled up their game in competition with the Chinese legends. The M40 has certain exclusive features to outrun its competitors. The Infinity O display, under display speaker and the triple camera setup are some of its highlighted features. I have been using this device rigorously for a few days, so do read my review till the end before you buy this phone.

Before jumping into the review, let's see some of the technical specs.

=============
 Specifications
=============

Display:  6.3 inches, 1080 x 2340 px, Infinity-O Display.

Processor  : 2.0 GHz, Octa Core, Snapdragon 675 chipset.

Fingerprint sensor:  Yes, rear-mounted.

Battery  : 3500mAh with 15W fast charging.

 Box Contents
============
📦 Samsung M40.
📦 15W Fast Charger.
📦 Type - C Basic Earphones.
📦 Sim Ejector Pin.
📦 User Manual.

=======
 Design
=======
The M40 looks stunning in terms of design, Samsung has provided 2 colour variants on the M40, Sea Water Blue and Mid Night Blue. I'm a classic person, so I chose the Mid Night Blue instead of the Sea Water Blue. Both colours are great in its own style.

The phone's body is made of plastic, but Samsung has managed to give a glass finish to the plastic body.

The absence of 3.5mm headphone jack might be an issue for some users, Samsung has provided a basic type c earphone in the box for the wired earphones users. I mostly use wireless earphones, so with Dolby atoms, it's not a big issue for me.

The fingerprint sensor is on the backside as usual. (We'll talk about the performance later in the review).

The triple camera setup looks good and takes some impressive shots, Samsung has managed to keep the camera inside the body, though it does pop out a bit, but it's not an issue while keeping the phone on a flat surface. The ring around the wide-angle sensor does deserve a mention here, it looks good when looking at the camera.

The Infinity O display looks amazing, it's a great improvement over the dewdrop notch and a regular notch. The punch hole is at a corner of the display, so it doesn't disturb the viewing while playing games or watching videos. I kind prefer this one over the other 2.

Samsung M40 is a great phone in terms of design. I really like the Infinity O display.

=======
 Display
=======
The Samsung M40 features a 6.3-inch FHD+ Infinity O Display with a 91.5% Screen to body ratio. I really hoped for a Super AMOLED Display on this, considering the lower priced M30 which comes with one. Even without a Super AMOLED Display, the display looks sharp with vibrant colours and has good viewing angles.

The Widevine L1 Certification allows us to watch Full HD contents on Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.

The display is clear and great on normal conditions, but we have to turn the brightness to full in order to get better visibility on direct sunlight.

=======
 Camera
=======
Now let's talk about the camera. We have a triple camera setup on the rear. The first sensor is a 32 Megapixel with F1.7 Aperture and the second one is an ultra-wide sensor of 8 Megapixel with F2.2 Aperture, the third one is a 5 Megapixel depth sensor. I tried taking some indoor and outdoor shots with the M40, the camera performs quite good in outdoor conditions, but we can notice a slight lag in performance at indoor conditions.

Now, let's talk about the front camera, on the front we have a 16 Megapixel camera with F2.0 Aperture. The front camera performs great both indoors and outdoors.

The camera is good on overall basis, but Samsung does have to work on the image processing. It can be improved by updates.

============
 Performance
============
Now, down to the most important part. The M40 runs on a Snapdragon 675 processor, which is seen on most of the phones in this price range. The Snapdragon 675 is a powerful and efficient chipset. I've used the phone for a few days, I didn't feel any issues on day to day usage. I tried playing some Pubg with this and it's really great, the punch hole display is very efficient for games as the notch is at a corner, we get better visibility. The Snapdragon 675 is great for a day to day performance and can easily carry out any hard tasks.

The One UI on top android pie is fresh and gives a good experience. Though regular Samsung users might miss some features from their old UI.

Now, let's talk about the overall performance. The M40 has an under-screen speaker which works great for calls, the call quality is amazing. It also supports dual VOLTE. The fingerprint sensor works perfectly every time, but there's a slight delay which was improved after an OTA Update.

On Overall basis, the M40 performs great for a mid-range phone. Though there is some small issues here and there, which can be improved over updates.

=======
 Battery
=======
The M40 has a 3500mAh battery which sounds small when compared with the competitors who offer 4000 and some even 5000mAh. As I said earlier, the Snapdragon 675 is a powerful and Efficient processor which is efficiently pushing the battery upto its limit. The battery can easily last for a day or two on regular usage and can last for at least a day on heavy usage. The fast charger is pretty much quick to charge, I'm not sure about the exact time of full charge, but roughly it takes a little over an hour to fully charge the device.

=======
 Verdict
=======
Finally, we are here at the end of the review. The Samsung Galaxy M40 is a decent phone in the mid-range segment and it is packed with some exclusive features to take out it's competitors. Though it does have some minor cons, but the pros far outweigh the cons. In my opinion, The M40 is a best option under 20k.

Build quality is great and OneUI is clean; and that's where the liking for this phone will end.

What you will not like:
_ Poor camera.
_ No 3.5mm headphone jack.
_ No AMOLED display. But the picture quality is good.
_ No warm colour setting in the phone! There's a night mode. But it just makes the system UI dark instead of light. Like the "Light" or "Dark" mode in Windows 10. Cheaper phones have warm colour mode for blue light filter. OneUI on flagship models have a Screen Mode option, where you can set the White Balance slider to cool or warm. Although M40 has OneUI, there's no such option. I don't understand why. May be cost cutting. But how?
_ On call voice clarity is bad. Especially, if you're outside in traffic, you will not be able to hear most of the conversation.

Honest opinion - M40 is not really worth 20k. Chinese brands offer more value for money and that too below 15k.

I was hesitating to purchase a Samsung phone but after a lot of review, I've decided to go for M40. I must tell you that this phone looks so cool in your hands with that premium look and punch hole display. Display is the biggest plus for this phone.

Tou can feel the difference between exynos and Snapdragon processor clearly. My friend has got Samsung A50 on which I see a slight noticable lag when opening the apps..but M40 is much smoother and faster.

Battery is not draining fast...but 4000 mah would have been better.

Poor camera quality, both front and back. Shoots blurred photos. Speaker quality and volume is below average. Can't be used with single hand, size wise it feels very tall phone and slightly wide too. This phone is primarily for those looking for good looks and smooth performance.

Received in 24hrs of order, product is beautiful and easy to setup, I am a core iphone user, so will take so.e time to get used to.

No hang, no minus attentions at this time, detail review will do after some significant use of the product.

Overall nice product in this price

The product from the home of Samsung is excellent, but there are two shortcomings I have found that fingerprint unlock is in back side while everyone is coming with onscreen unlock.

Secondly the camera is not as per my expectation.

Rest is an excellent phone, nice look and so handy.

I had bought this piece for the purpose of gifting it to my better half who was madly in love with her existing mi phone of lower make. I thought it would be a nice  surprise given the much created hype around it. However, that was not to be! In a couple of days of use came about glaring lag in terms of innovation. This phone does not have an inbuilt app lock system which in turn meant one has to download a third party app to secure ones app. In other words one had to handover one's house keys to one's dubious neighbour and wish everything remained safe thats because one never knows what kind of data an application might gather once installed. Any which ways I did download an app locker app which- to my horror- when found inadequate refused to get uninstalled easily!!
I had to read the uninstallation process thoroughly to get it removed from my device. An epiphany occured- getting a monkey off my back made no better sense than this time. Further, it had no ir port which is so very common in mi sets. this meant letting go a free universal remote. Camera- i see a lot of discussion happen around this thing in recent timws was average. battery was average. But the most annoying thing was the technology  which professes that the sound comes from the surface of the screen. Its a dumb idea. the sound came as if some one had put on a plastic cover over a capable woofer in a common sound system. I can go on and on against this technology but in a single word for me this phone is a bad idea if  you are an mi buff.
Am ruing why i chose to experiment!!😢😢
i recommend an mi upgrade.

Camera satisfactory. Battery could have been of bigger capacity. Just at unpack of box, the SIM Tray didn't came out with the provided pin. I had to take brand-new device to Service Center. Initially they said that the tray is stuck inside, but somehow they pulled it out. Now, I'm using the phone. Only worry is that it shouldn't be another struggle when taking out the the SIM.
Other wise no other issues. Screen Sound is average and needs improvement.
Worth at the price range.

It is a great phone if we compare it with old Samsung phones these are much better both quality, specs and price.
Pros
1. Good build quality
2. Infinity O display is just amazing.
3. Great design
4. Triple camera setup with main 32 mp camera.
5. front camera is good.
6. One ui with android pie.
7. Fast charging support 15w
8. Type-c earphones are included.
9. Snapdragon 675 soc
10. 6gb ram &amp; 128gb internal storage.
11. Has NFC support as well.

Cons
1. No 3.5 mm audio jack
2. Tft display which is not that good at outdoor
3. No case or protective film pre applied
4. Rear camera is clear but when we zoom pic little bit there is no detailing. Samsung should work on its camera and puch ota soon.
5. Battery is small only 3500 mah which is very less from its predecessors which have 5000mah battery.

Here are pros and cons from my perspective and If you like my review made it helpful so it helps other people as well.
And if you want to see its true video I have uploaded on YouTube by "Gadget Pages" you can watch there as well.
I have uploaded some pictures which can give you idea of its camera.

I PURCHASE SAMSUNG M40 FROM AMAZON ON 27.10.2018. ITS SCREEN IS NOT TOUGH GLASS COVER AND VERY MUCH FRAGILE. JUST I HAVE KEPT PHONE IN TROUSER POCKET AND BEND FOR TIGHTENING SHOE LACES ITS TOP SCREEN GLASS GOT PRESSED AND DEVELOPED CRACK AS SHOWN IN SNAP. IT DOESN'T HAVE GORILLA GLASS IT BREAK DOWN IS ALSO COSTLY. AS PER SERVICE CENTER IT IS CONSIDER AS PHYSICAL DAMAGE AND NOT REPAIR UNDER WARRANTLY FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE TOP GLASS WITH SCREEN THEY ARE CHARGING SOMEWHERE ABOUT 5500 RS. SO THING BEFORE PURCHASE OF THE SAME. ITS A DELICATE DARLING PHONE.

Well I love the infinity o display.  One of my primary reasons of buying the phone.

The performance is amazing with no lags or freezes what so ever.

Memory is standard with 128gb storage and 6gb ram is enough to play the demanding of games or multitask.

Fingerprint reader is really responsive and has never failed me apart from a few rare times where it showed you that your hands are dirty.

Camera is pretty standard.  Do not expect iphone quality images,  but on the better side given the price range,  with sharp and natural coloured images.

The down side is the battery.  On regular use (though my uses are a bit on the heavy side with high amount of media consumption) it gives me like 12-14 hour's of battery to last me through the day.

Combining everything, a very nice product, just that the cost is a bit high. If this was around 16k would have been one of the best phones to buy in the range.

I bought the phone last week, below are the Pros and Cons:
-Features like APPLOCK, Call Recorder, Scanner are not available. These features are available in Samsung's other more costly phones but NOT in this phone.
-Gesture features like Palm swipe or finger scroll to take screenshot is not available.
-Camera quality - Good.
-Battery Life - Not good. Drains very fast. I have to charge the phone two times in a day.
-Value for money - Yes. But battery drain will annoy you.

It looks absolutely stunning when it comes to design and performance. However I am a bit disappointed with its battery backup. I bought it couple of days back and will be evaluating it further.

The phone is nice, as shown in d pictures. I bought the seawater blue, looks great.
Only disappointment was the CAMERA.the images are so soft n blur , especially the front camera. I don't think anyone from Samsung  tested this camera before selling. Hope Samsung sends an UPDATE soon. Camera needs to be repaired.

Writing review after 3 weeks of usage. First of all I'm not a Samsung fan or neither Xiaomi fan. This is my honest review...

DESIGN : Design in pretty good and phone look premium in hands. And the gradient effect on the backside is really beautiful.

SCREEN : It doesn't have super amoled screen. It is its biggest drawback. But TFT is fine...Just fine

BATTERY : 3500 mah is not so low...Average user gets 8hr screen-on-time...

PERFORMANCE &amp; GAMING : This is the best part of this phone...I didn't felt any lag switching between apps or opening them...6GB ram is more than enough for multitasking and heavy gaming. I also played PUBG, ASPHALT 9, FORTNITE and ran without any noticeable framedrops.

SOFTWARE &amp; UI : Phone comes out of the box with Android 9.0.0 and One UI 1.1. I of the best thing happened to Samsung devices is the new OneUI. It is very simple, neat &amp; Ad free. One UI also has some unique features compared to other UI.

CAMERA : Even Samsung clam it has 32MP sensor image, quality is not so good...Images are not sharp enough...Front camera is ok...And video recording is just fine in 1080p at 60fps...It can also rec upto 2160p

Headphone jack is missing. But I don't care cuz today we mostly have Bluetooth speakers and headphones.

Value for Money : Unlike other cheep chinese smartphones, It have good built quality and Ad free UI. One of the main reason why I didn't go with Redmi Phones is it have a lot of boltware and ads. Trust me that is ridiculous. And if the Camera problem solve with the future updates, you don't have to regret for paying 20k.

Please read the review if you are planning to purchase the same.

I bought this phone few days back from the sale in Midnight Blue Color which is Amazing

It comes in a nice packaging and in box it includes Charging adapter, cable, type-c earphones, user manual and sim ejector.

Phone quality is good as its very light weight and even compaq to use it and carry as it only weighs 170 grams something and display resolution is not that much big as of other phones in this price range even can be used by 1 hand only.

 Rear panel of the phone looks similar to all M series phone, and you will find fingerprint sensor at the back.

In the front you will get punch hole display that's the very new in market and only available with samsung M40 as of now.

It features triple camera at back which gives awesome picture quality.

New Feature is Screen Sound Technology which means the sound is delivered from under display which is basically done to reduce bezels.

In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.

As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.

PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 &amp; it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.

GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 &amp; 9 works great.

STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.

SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience.

In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.

BATTERY PERFORMANCE—It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.

It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.

Overall a worth buy purchase and my recommendation for this phone are highly valuable for the one who is planing to purchase.

I am not a professinal reviewer but will try to help you guys.

Consider other options rather than buying this phone as it is overpriced. It should have been priced below 16500.

This is why:

 I will start with the positives.

* The phone is good to hold as it is sleek
* It looks good because of the glossy finish and the punch hole camera.
* It has 6gb of RAM
* Samsung UI is good to use and gives some great customization options.
* Responsive fingerprint sensor.

This is why you should not buy this phone:

* I am not happy with the display of this phone and you can see the image for the reason. The screen around the punch hole camera and the edges is too dull and seems like is not properly lit which instantly made me realize that going for Moto one vision could have been a better option. I filed a return after 3-4 days od usage however the inspection agent didn't find any issur with it. I am still not satisfied with that.

* Poor camera performance. All the cameras are underperformers. Click pretty basic pictures and I was getting better or similar results from my previous phone- moto g5s plus. Doesn't suffice the reason of upgrading.

* Face recognition is not super-responsive but does the job. You will not be impressed.

* Battery drain is an issue. It will last a day with average usage. I avoid keeping the settings that drain more battery.

* It has not even been two months and sometimes I see some lag while scrolling (facebook and even contacts at time). Scrolling is a pretty basic things a smartphone must be able to deliver but this one fails. (May be this is an issue with my device specifically)

There is no point of asking for a return once you get the device as a service engineer will be sent at your place and they decide whether this will be eligible for a refund/return. So don't take a chance on that one.

Overall, I am just ok with this phone as it has not amazed me yet. That's why I think it should have been priced  below 16500.

I think this is a great phone that anyone would want to have. The phone is amazing. This is my second week using it.

1.Security
The phone comes loaded with several security features. Facelock works well, fingerprint is quite fast. There's a virus scanner too powered by McAfee. It's good to know that you're safe on that end too.

2. Design and display
I love the design of the phone. Feels premium and looks premium. Display is massive, infinity O. I tried streaming on Netflix, definitely looks great.

3. Camera
I am not a huge fan of pictures but I can tell when I see a good picture taken by a good camera. Three cameras that perform well in lit areas but the pictures don't look quite sharp. They look a bit washed out. But hey, the camera is good. The front camera does its job. Nice pictures, detailed and kinda looks sharp.

4. Performance and memory.
Blown my mind. I haven't noticed any stutters when switching tabs, or any lag. Really fast phone. I tried playing Darkness Rises. It's a demanding game when it comes to graphics and performance but the phone handles it like a boss. PUBG players will definitely love it.

5. Battery
This right here is an issue for me. Yes it has a fast charge but the battery doesn't really last that long. A day should be about how long you can go depending on how you are using it.

6. No 3.5 mm headset  Jack. Yupp. It doesn't have it. I love my music, and I don't mind that it's missing this. I use bluetooth headphones most of the time. When I am not, I don't mind using the type c headsets that come with the phone. Which are quite good. I love the fact that I am different. 😅. And oh the earpiece speaker is within the display, that sure does look cool.

Verdict Time👨🏾‍⚖
Do I think you should buy it? Obviously you should🙄😁, it's a great phone by a great brand. It looks stylish and looks premium. Performs really well and definitely a worthy investment considering the price. I would buy me another if I had to.😌

i am using smart phones from time Nokia dominated the market. i bought M40 after reading its reviews. What reviewer says and what i found after comparing to my  old different phone is that this is a paid reviewers WOW phone . Or I got a fake Galaxy M40
sound quality is wow bed ,finger touch is erratic but some time it  say to clean touch sensor, too much adds after opening any  apps, installed apps never heard off, you cannot uninstall them.my favorite apps not working. etc, etc
over all not good experience and wanted to change to my old mobile .
horrible , horrible battery life . need multiple charges per day and you don't find type c fast charger every where
those who gave 5 stars must have got good  M40 or i got a  fake phone from my favorite AMAZON

Stay away from this phone if you want to save your money.
I am not sure how this one is garnering positive responses, I believe they are falling for the live focus and other preprocessing filters.
Anyways to start with, Sound screen technology is one innovation that hampers the basic usage of phone, You have to develop sharp ears to understand or hear the other person, while you do that you have to ignore the vibrations of the phone while taking a call, This is one big compromise, ofcourse you can train yourself as i did to live with it after 10-15 days.
Camera: 2015 released redmi note 3 has better selfies than this one, it has unnecessary filters, even if you install an app which takes RAW images, the quality is super bad. What would i do with a wide angle when the quality of the camera itself is bad.
Battery: Serious gaming will drain it out in 4-5 hours, if it is the situation now, imagine how it will be in a year.

My suggestion would be filter our 1-star ratings and seriously read through, don't ignore them, find out if you see a pattern, if you still are lured with 5-Stars please go ahead and don't tell me that I have not warned you!!

You can find better phones than this one within 20000. Don’t purchase it just because it has in screen camera like S10, rest it’s a average phone. Battery backup hardly last for 15-16 hours within regular use(internet surfing, Whatsapp, fb etc). There are variety of camera modes in it but camera is all about the real colour tone and quality photos which you’ll not able to get using this device as selfie and back camera is just average. I wasn’t expected much in 20k but my iPhone SE of 15000 Rs is way better in terms of camera and quite equal in battery backup as well

2. Sluggish when I am using higer quality to play PUBG.

3. The phone speakers are not that good.

4. At high Zoom stability is v poor.

2. Look wise classy.

3. Neat UI

4. Battery is avg

5. Greater details and better display but indoors.

6. Face recognition is very fast, although my last ph did not had FR but I have seen ppl using IPhone have to literally look at the camera and struggle especially if you were specs..

I used this mobile for 5 days. The battery is the worst part, it hardly lasts 6-7 hours without even using heavy apps. 16mp selfie camera is like 3mp camera, rear camera is okay but not worth for a 32mp camera.  onscreen call sound is not clear.
Total waste of money. I thought samsung has improved but i was wrong.

I liked the phone, it has all the features I wished right from RAM, storage, camera and battery but handset I received was defective, the sound icon would pop up on screen at irregular intervals from nowhere like ghost and pause whatever you r doing.
Ordered for replacement and the replaced product had the same issue. Thus, had to return it and thanks to Amazon it was facilitated easily.

Appears Samsung has launched this product in a hurry. Too many software issues within 1 month of usage. After using for 1 month, all excitement of using a latest product has gone. Sometimes even the basic functions malfunction which are restored (sometimes not) only after a restart. Within days, it again needs a restart. Not exactly the one to be recommended as you shell out 20k for it and do not have a smooth experience even for a month. Nothing special about the much hyped camera and fingerprint sensor too. The 10 day replacement window is too small for such products. Amazon please take note. Was carrying too many expectations, simply disappointed.

Hi in this phone the major drawback is the speaker quality.. the opposite party voice is not  clear, it will be broad and seems like they are speaking from inside the well. I opted for return  but Amazon declined as it is the feature of the phone and Amazon could not bear that.  HD voice call is good. But there other calls really so bad. Whatever may be the other features our prime job with phone is to talk right?.. For a normal usage battery is serving a day with the data alone in ON condition. Camera clarity is very average.  You can better go for A50 fort better performance at low cost.

The camera is fine,  but will work only if you have a good battery life! If you want to totally disconnect from using internet,  opt for this phone! M40 has such a hopeless battery life,  that you won't dare to keep the functions  of sync on/ your phone brightness will be less than 40%  , your mobile data will be off for most of the hours,  you will stop listening music But Still....U Have to charge the phone twice in a day!!!! Better take any other phone or stick to your old one.. don't get carried away by the features,  they all need a good battery life . Amazon doesn't allow you to exchange your piece with any other,  they have their own conditions.  Samsung will call for feedback,  but will not give any solution since they belong to feedback department, and not the technical one!!

Initially, I was quite happy with the looks and performance. The camera was not that great, but it just did my job.
The back of the phone is extremely susceptive to scratches. So its never been out of the cover.

11/09/2019. (Just after 2 months from buying):
This annoying notification started appearing (see attached images), the earphone stopped working and the screen wouldn't lock. The display was on full time draining the battery. It seemed like some issue with the Type C port. So I gave it to the service center.

14/09/2019
The day I received it back from the service center, the same issue started occurring again.
Going to try my luck again with the service center. Will update it soon.

15/09/2019
Okay so resetting the phone solved the issue.

17/09/2019
The phone stopped charging. Gave it to the service center again.

25/09/2019
So these guys wrote someone else number on my service documents, and I didn't even get the call that my phone is repaired. As soon as I reached home and connected my phone to my pc, the same issue started again. Earphones not working. Thank you samsung

What was my fault in all of this? Nothing.
Also, the guys at the service center said that there were similar issues with other devices as well. So be careful if you are thinking of making the purchase. I would suggest better go with Redmi K20. Or just something else but not Samsung.

Display stopped working after 14days, visited service center &amp; after keeping phone for one day they replaced display, on testing found mic &amp; phone vibration are not working. They replaced mic too. It didn't help, phone was still not responding as normal. Now they are suspecting issues with motherboard. I asked what is left their to replace, &amp; requested for replacement which they denied saying as per policy they can't replace phone age 14days above.
I'm fighting with their service executives on call &amp; on social platforms like Twitter.
This is turning into a nightmare. Worst decision by investing on Samsung phone, worst quality, pathetic service.

The battery drains faster. You cant even imagine how rapidly it drains your phone's battery. There is a heating problem as well. Camera flicker in slow motion mode under yhe light. Camera quality is not that good. Screen is awesome no doubt. Touch is superb as well. The on screen voice feature is not good at all. It sounds like buzzing a fly on your ear. There is an echo of the sound over the call. Even M30 is far better than M40 in terms of battery and other performance metrics. Requested for return on the very first day.

Bought this phone for mom and she would visit for few months to the UK. But figured out phone would work only on Indian sim. Samsung India has provided lies and misinformation that cumulative calls for 5 mins would unlock but it hasn't and when visited Samsung showroom in Chennai was told have to use for few more hours or only UK Samsung can unlock. Without a proper way to unlock and absolutely zero support from Samsung this phone is a disaster for people who would travel abroad or go on vacations. DON'T BUY IS THE VERDICT.

Its only second day after my purchase, my reviews are as follows for now.
LOOK _good as i like the "O" display but in back case gap between joints are little big,so dust could be accumulated fast.
Performance _Ok till now, Themes in display are irritating but could download different. I am editing after two days use. Face unlock not working properly
Battery_ average as drains in a day on normal use. but in stand by last bit more. charging cable is too short.
earphone provided is good
overall_ good at this price range

Dear Friends,
Please don't not buy any phones from Amazon, until you know the product very well. After you purchase you can't Return/no refund. Only they will replace if any issues with product.
Recently I bought a Samsung M40, and it as only bottom loud speaker. Voice clarity is very worst since no speaker on the top of the phone. I got to know this after Receiving the phone, Amazon Refuse to Refund. So friends pls Don't waste your time and Money with these online website. Please visit your Nearest store touch and feel the products  and buy, if you are Good Negotiators even you get it lesser than these websites price.
Thank you

the phone is good overall minus the camera
PROS
1. Fingerprint is spot on. Good Read with cover or without cover. you can set your fingerprints in like 5 seconds. its that fast
2. Phone's Speed is good for apps and games.
3. Charges fast and runs whole day with regular social media and work
4. Interesting Earpiece for calls which is hidden behind the screen. Not Great but good.

CONS (This Matters)
1. Camera is the worst. Focus Lags big Time. Moving objects are always blurred. Selfie Camera is still fine but that is mostly because you are in control and you tend to pause during your own click.
2. Focus in Low Light will make you Cry every time.
3. All the Flagship stickers and effects from Samsung are missing.

If you can ignore the camera then the phone is good looking and decent phone from samsung. But sad to say there are many better options in the market.

Hello Friends this is a real review about the phone if you want you can call me and verify at 09811023300 Its only 4 days i have been using this phone and have the following issue as i am surprised to see Samsung launched phone with so many flaws..As these are the manufacturing defect of the phone and today my 10 years loyalty have gone 0 for samsung..

Please find the issues below..
1. Phone earpiece  - you cannot listen to the caller clearly as the speaker is inbuilt so the voice is getting echo as well if you are standing outside roadside then for sure you cannot listen to the caller if its a traffic on road.
2. No separate light sensor seems it is in inbuilt camera so it senses very late. If you pickup the phone in the night to see time your eyes will burn as the display is at highest brightness then suddenly sensor senses and lowers the brightness.
3. the finger print sensor is useless. It only senses when the display is on. If you put your finger on sensor then it wont wake up phone.
4. Sometimes you click on any voice note it will play in earpiece rater then speaker and till the time voice note finishes you wont be able to click anywhere else.
5. Again the sensor now if you call someone and put the phone on ear the screen light closes and if the call gets connected its well and good and if it wont then you cannot call again bcoz the light sensor wont switch on the display so you need to press the power button to get the display and then disconnect and redial.

Guys the above reviews are verified on one more unit of Samsung M40 only and i am really sorry for Samsung bcoz this Defective product launch shows Samsung is over confident about their products and their customers. Not a big deal soon some brand will capture their market like they captured Nokia before if they will do few more launches like this.

My 20k went on a toss. I have offered my phone for reselling but i cant hide the issues if i m selling my phone to any phone thats why no buyer in my known.

I bought this phone from Amazon I Bought Samsung Galaxy M10 for my wife and Samsung Galaxy M30 for my brother and experience of both phones was very good.
I bought  Samsung Galaxy M40  for myself on 16th of July but thinking that this phone is premium phone but when I used this phone I experienced that it heats up after 5 minutes of use. I reported the issue to Amazon they advised me to do factory reset and update software but no use after repeated problem I again contacted amazon and agent asked me to run Blancco application phone is actually getting heat up but application shows temperature is  35°C which is in acceptable range. He also accepted that phone is heating but he said i can only write/report only result shown by application CPU_Z which he installed on my phone to check the temperature. Also amzon sent their executive to check the phone physically he also observed that phone heats up but application shows temperature. There is no use of sending any one if he can't report actual facts which can be felt not measured.

I felt cheated after buying this phone which is having manufacturing defect and Amazon's return policy don't help in solving customer pain.

Very bad experience with this phone......

Totally waste of money I feel cheated with a defected phone.

Amazon/Samsung should understand that not all products manufactured are defected only few products get out of factory with manufacturing defect . For defect of manufacturing customer shouldn't suffer pain or economic loss .

Is it fault of customer if product is defective?

Thanks &amp; Regards to Amazon and Samsung for selling me defective product and making me feel cheated.

Cons:
1. Battery life is too short
2. Voice quality is not good since there is no earpiece, you can feel the vibrations in screen during calls. Too bad
3. Poor camera especially front, can't believe it's Samsung (fixed after OTA update)
4. Fast charging is a joke compared to competition.
5. Older processor (675)
6. Slower fingerprint unlock
6. Adaptive display does not work efficiently, there is much of a delay.

Overall all cost cutting by Samsung except the display. Even charger cable is shorter.
I had Oppo F9 pro (2018) and M40 is clearly a downgrade from Oppo's older and cheaper model. Shame on Samsung.
Not satisfied. And the best part is, you cannot return!

Good phone with nice features. Camera quality is fantastic. Fingerprint sensor is working very fast. The battery took about 1 hrs time to get fully charged and has good battery life of more than 1 day.
Con: the hybrid sim slot. Either you can keep the second sim or you can keep the sd card. You cannot have both together like A50. But as this phone comes with 128 GB internal memory so perhaps you might not need the external memory.
But if you need both the sim and the external memory card, then this phone is not for you.

Worst product from Samsung. Basic use of phone is call, in this phone incoming call is not clear, you can not able hear other person voice because of this on screen sound technology. Also phone vibrates during the call ????

I tried all options, increased call volume,  did tried in safe mode, did the setting reset, did changed the sim, finally did the factory reset. But issue still remains.

It is not practical to always use headset or use speaker mode for calls.

On top of these, Amazon is not supporting for the exchange of different model as this has this performance/ feature issue. Amazon can only replace which won't help in this case.

Likes -
1. Less Weight
2. Fast charging
3. Dolby Audio in headphones
4. Good clarity in camera
Dislikes -
1. Receiver is not visible like other devices. So need to change the positions of keeping the phone in your ears then and there.
2. Heats very much. If you play games mobile gets heated very much. Its too too much heat. Even if you open camera it is getting heated.
3. When u open camera and u receive a call, after u cut the call the screen gets flickered multiple times.

Im writing this review after using it for more than a week. Let's start from the display. Display Quality is cool and bright however missing AMOLED. Back Camera quality is superior even works better in low light. Front camera is poor. Battery backups is sufficient, for normal user it lasts upto 12 hour. I was expecting atleast 4000 MAh but its ok. Phone is handy. Very soft and smooth touch. On screen sound technology  did not impress so much. Voice comes robotic and some time have to put effort while listening  to caller. For Ganers: I tried PUBG,  No Lag, supports high quality graphics hy default. So for Gamers Samsung M40 with 6 GB RAM and Snapdragon 675 processor,  phone will not disappoint you. Overall the phone is worth buying it will not disappoint you.

Everything is good except light poor Battery performance. Charger not performing as a fast charger.

Camera quality very good,

Speaker Sound mode quality is better than on screen technology sound mode,

 in rush area the on screen sound not performing in a quality full manner.

However, Rest performance is very good in such rate and incomparison with some famous China set's.

Overall the performance is very cool. Like a branded set.

This is my tenth smart phone and believe me nothing tops this one.
I see a smart phone as an investment to my work and private life balance. A smart phone should be fast enough to gather all the information one could grab in seconds.
With 6GB RAM this phone runs on ice. Like I said balance is important. The screen size it offers provides the ease and quick juncture for your thirst for work done.
Lets pin down goddies-
1. Camera- stunning
2. Touch - even gloves on you can slide with left hand
3. Resolution- only iPhone matches it
4. Apps compatibility- all apps like every app
5. Screen size- covers every corner
6. Face lock- even slight gesture is enough. You can unlock with your specs on.
7. Sound - Cristal clear

I think it's a GO GO Product.

Only flaw I found is absence of 3.1 audio jack but who cares as this is "THE" Bluetooth age.

Well got this phone on 5th September found out that the back panel was not perfectly glued and claimed replacement.And from here the hell started ,trouble shooting is not a hassle free service.Got the first appointment on 8th and they didn't call me or tried to contact me in any means so I tried to contact them with the nber given by them and they won't lift it.At end end of the day they sent me an email that we couldn't contact you so you have to reschedule the appointment and next appointment was available on 12th September .Thank god ,this time the technician has come and he checked the phone and labelled it as damaged piece and our replacement request has gone through .After a day still there was no update on our replacement so we called the customer care and they said the seller doesn't have any new piece to replace it so we gonna refund the money .That's ok considering that I get my money back. But I really liked the phone and I wished that they provide me a replacement ,which didn't happen so had to return. That technician told me that 60% of Samsung phones are coming out with manufacturing defects and that made to skip buying any Samsung phone. Phone perse is very dashing and cool looking .Perfomance and camera are decent too . Sufficient for the price range.But check thoroughly for for any manufacturing defects soon after you buy.

Useless phone useless camera
Samsung has deteriorated its quality over the years.
I was using Vivo V9 and had high hopes with this phone but feel disappointed.
-----
1.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon is not even ready to take return and replace with any other phone.

Cons:
Main Drawback of M40 is its camera quality. Photos look like blurred.
I had used J7 and on8 in past this phone has not pictures quality like them.
Photos look like they are clicked from a low range mobile.
On screen speaker is causing problem in audio quality.
Memory is 128 GB but I can see 26 GB is already reserved.
Earphone is C-type so it can not be used with other 3.5 MM jacks.

Pros:
Speed and battery life is good and satisfactory.
6 GB Ram and 128 GB space is in this range is satisfactory.
Phone does not heat up like other Samsung phone does while charging and using mobile data.

Honestly phone is very cute. With o infinity display Galaxy M40 is a master piece at that price also with snap dragon 675 soc. However a small pinch of pain pervades me due to hybrid slot which is not a Samsung design. I am missing SD card. Also I am missing s Amoled display. Small problem is with call receiving where voice is low and echoing. I hope samsung will fix those minor issues. Other wise phone touch is fantastic. Speed is good. No heating issues. Battery life is good for complete day usage. Overall I give 4 stars. Finger print is fast enough. Camera quality is good.

This phone stopped working just within a month (in fact 14 days ) of buying, it went dead wouldn't re-charge or start.  I'm still running around to get it fixed. Not sure if I'm the unlucky one but do ensure you get the insurance when buying online otherwise no one cares post-purchase, you are just on your own. Realized its better to buy locally, at least you know who to go back in case of issues.

Camera front &amp; back is worst, its both cameras are like old samsung s dous series phones.
If u go to service center they will tell just do software update &amp; will return you your phone &amp; will say your camera is perfect &amp; having no problem.

So guys pls don’t buy this phone for god shakes &amp; i have wasted by money buy this faltu phone.

Pros:

Only good thing about phone is its premium  look and display
Cons:

1) Worst in call sound quality, very irritating  to have conversation on call which should be the basic most important  thing  for any phone

2) Battery draining too fast on idle phone

3) selfie camera picture quality is not good and  having artificial effects

The first look of this phone is awsome. A well balanced phone by samsung at this price range. But its not competitive. The only reason I bought it that I didn't want to go for Chinese brands.
Display is awesome but not as clear as amoled. The snapdragon provides the swiftness like butter. No overheating issue infact no heating at all. Battery is average. 100% battery with 20 hrs of general use had 30% remaining at the end. No fast draining. Type C earphones sounds awsome. The Dolby Atmos adjusts sound very well. Camera is average but that's not the problem for me cuz I haven't bought it for camera.
Overall if you want to have something with a good brand name. This is the device for you.

After using 3 days I am writing this review..
Fingerprint sensor is little bit high..it suppose to be little bit down, so can reach easily.
Camera quality is not what I expected, I saw photos taken by redmi not 7 pro, far better this.
Battery life is also not what I expected, can not run full day, even without browsing whole day..need charge again.
After 1 month, its screen starting giving problem..while working, its touch stop working, to work it again, need to switch screen off than start again.. I recommend not to buy this phone..

Awesome product.
The Smartphone is very smooth and fast.
Display is super.
Performance of this M40 with snapdragon 675 processor is very smooth in comparison to exynos processor used by samsung phone.
Camera quality is amazing.
Phone speaker is loud and sufficient for watching videos.
My criteria to buy this phone was performance and I'll give 5 out of 5.

Don't bother about 3.5 mm jack and amoled screen, they are nothing in comparison of features of this phone.

Go for this manufactured in India smartphone, you wont feel disappointed.

I have got defective piece that headset speaker is very bad sound and light sensor not working properly very sad with this product and I have raise for return for genuine product but not getting solution quickly.......really very bad service given by amazon very disappointing that when i complain within a week that mobile is defective  auto brightness and headset speaker not working then they have taken a inspection service and inspection executive also accepted that mobile really defective should be replaced and i am waiting from last 3 days for change but not able to talk customer care neither replacement status getting very disappointing......😭😭😭😭

It's been just 4 months I bought this phone.. now phone got hanged and not getting switched on... just showing Samsung logo.. when I asked these people they said me to contact samsung people and when I go to service center they are denying it to claim the warranty because there is a dent on the edge of the phone.. but the issue is related to motherboard and it is a technical issue.. Please don't buy any Samsung phone..  They are making people fools..( due to one single scratch in the edge of the phone they are not claiming warranty )

Continuation
After all the above story I gave my mobile in the samsung service center on paid service..
These Samsung service people said me as expected the motherboard is corrupted due to intact damage so it needs to be changed(they said it costs around 10,500Rs).. I thought I can buy new one with some more extra money.. so I said them to not repair and I got it back... recently I watched YouTube and learned how to reset with keys.. my mobile got switched on.. and now I m writing the review with same phone..

CONCLUSION:
1.If you buy mobile buy hard case.
2. Make sure you won't put any scratch on mobile to avail warranty.
3. If ur mobile is not under warranty don't go to Samsung service center because they are literally looting people.. According to my experience I am saying  this.
4. As I saw many people were crying in the service center to pay the service fees which will be higher than your mobiles present cost.
5. And few of them were fighting with them who have good backgrounds.
6. A people like Us(middle class) will come home without complaining anyone.

The mobile looks quite good externally with the glossy look on it, however there were few things that disappointed me a little.

*The Battery Life: the power drains like anything, and the longest it lasts is-
1. 6-8 hours (If you're watching videos)
2. 4-5 hours(if you play continuous game)
3. 18-20 hours (if you just browse the phone, No Data but just Calls and Texts

*Camera quality
1. Looks more like a 16mp camera that says 32mp, not really great at all.
2. The newly added features are quite attracting but not so great.

Hardware:

So guys: If you have 2 sim cards and 1 SD card, then let me break the ice for you right away-
You can never use all the three together. The SD Card slot allows only either of them so either its the SD card or the Sim card.

Rest other things are quite fine according to me.

Thank

One of the worst product of this century. Don't buy it. Samsung is outwitting Indian consumer. If you are using two micro SIM, you can't insert micro SD card. Only Indian sim card can be used. Sim slot is made of plastic. You have to use only Samsung chargers or you have to carry the charger in your tours. Camera is worst . Old fashioned screenshot capturing system, i.e push sound and on-off button to capture screen shot .
Samsung's mentality is primitive style. They still thinks that they are pioneer, lol.
Don't buy it even if they offer at 50% discount.

Very low and unclear voice comes when you receive a call. Screen vibrates a lot during calls which feels very uncomfortable on your ears. In a crowded place or in traffic, you cannot received calls without headphones. Even if your phone is connected on charging you have to receive call on speaker mode because there is no separate jack for charging.
Battery backup is very very very POOR. Keep your charger all the time with you. In performance, very little difference is there in comparison of  M20. Samsung M20 is far better than this. And M20 is Rs. 9000 cheaper also.  First time I faced this problem in a Samsung Phone.

Pathetic camera!
The phone has a stunning display, excellent performance and an average batter but camera is the worst. Its not worth the money. I saw all reviews and expected camera to be average but reality is it is worse.

After usage of 40 days, below are my major finding:

Cons:
1. Very Very Wooooooooorst selfie cam
 (attached the selfie cam pic &amp; rear cam pic)
2. rear cam is ok, but NOT looks like 32 MP ouput
3. very sad &amp; dissapointed that is not allowing any Samsung Fonts &amp; NO Free fonts, all are paid fonts unlike regular samsung mobile series supports
4. average sound quality (on screen)

Pros:
1.  Very good Battery
2.  decent UI
3.  no issues with performance

If you want to waste your 20k then go for this worst phone.

Very disappointed with the this phone, samsung must grow up and stop fooling customers with such third class phones,
They says camera is 32MP + 8MP + 5MP triple rear camera but its not ever close to 2MP, even phone worth 5k has good camera than this stupid samsung M40.

The support team is also seems cheating, one person is arranging return and other is saying we don't have return policy.

Feeling cheated by amazon.
Don't buy this phone even for 5k also don't buy products from amazon.

Display quality, Camera quality, Internal Memory, Processor quality, RAM, Face unlock facility (which works great). You name and it is there in best possible specification in this phone. I cannot expect more in Rs. 20,000.

Better than any other phone of any company in this price range.

Battery could have been better but human wishes never end. Still I think power consumption of this phone is low. I spend only 60% from morning to evening with brightest display settings. No need to think twice if you plan to buy this phone. I am happy that I decided to buy it.

should not buy

1. the device hearing quality is too poor. the voice is cracking always and it is not audible. everytime I have to ask to repeat whatever is said.
2 ) the quality of  body and color on it are not good as it started having scratches since inception inspite of handling it sophisticatedly
3)  The amazon executive has visited and found the above problems to be correct and amazon offered me replacement but I would prefer a refund as i find from review section that most of the buyers have complain of about the similar hearing problem as described by me above. this model of phone suffers from inherent defect
 this model should be withdrawn by samsung immediately.

after complaint being made the phone was replaced but to my utter shock the replaced handset is having the same hearing problem. I am sure that this model suffers from inherent/manufacturing defect.

Need replacement.

2) Camera quality is bad I didn't like it personally.
3) Display  Super amoled would be good .
4) Plastic body looks cheap and glossy finish  leaves lots of fingerprints.
5) the volume button and power key looks cheap and don't know how long it will hold .

This phone is not upto to fulfill your requirements. Like phone camera is not good as told 32mega pixel doesn't give good photos and its front camera 16 mega pixel is also not it doesn't give clear photos....
But about speed ram 6gb with 128gb RoM give best speed to phone ...it feel u good ..and its design and screen will take ur attention....and others Al's 2. Camera doesn't have AI features And Phone doesn't have eye comfort or blue light cutt type features.....but may be it will added
And one new thing I will  going to experience like
Its receiver speaker is in build in screen only and .....may more features
Fingers print sensor is not good
Battery life average

fingerprint reader working good can be use for single handed operation.
Face unlocks also working fine.
Camera quality is fair, but we can find good cameras in phone in this prize range.
Phone hearing speaker is not good, screen vibrates and get heated on call.
Battery life is average
Major drawback is of headphones with no 3.5mm jack. you just cant use headphones while charging.
for better use we can use BT headphones.
For gaming phone is good, works good with 6gb/ 128gb.
Best thing i liked about this phone is LOOKS, really nice looking.

I bought a Samsung Galaxy M40 on June 20, 2019. I have received the product within a week, i.e on June 26, 2019. Thanks to amazing delivery from Amazon. I love the phone's minimalistic interface. The processor is smooth like butter. It is damn fast. Unlike some negative reviews as I found here, I never faced any heating issues. Further, I never faced any issues while talking to others over the phone. The on-screen sound technology works perfectly. The camera quality is decent. The sound quality is tremendous. Connect your earphone or get it to connect with any Bluetooth headphone and switch on the Dolby Atmos and see the magic. But......the only problem which I have faced in this phone is the BATTERY. Gosh.....it drains like anything.....besides this, this phone is good in this price range.

Guys who are looking forward to buy a phone at 20000k range, trust me you wouldn't get a better phone than this one. I LOVED it. It takes a sound test when you wear the earphones  and designs an adaptive sound for you.....its cool right isn't it!? It has dolby atmos sound. The wide angle photography is marvelous.. The interface  is great as well. It really feels good in our hands and fits perfectly fine. The position  of the selfie camera gives the phone  a beautiful look. Closing out I must say it's a great phone and it is a notch above its competitors in this price segment.  After all everyone knows about a samsung. GO FOR IT😀😀

Battery life is the biggest concern of this smartphone. Battery gets drained even when not in use. My brother-in-law got so fed up with it, that he took it to a local mobile shop and got it exchanged for Oppo F11. I don't blame him, I completely get it. But what I don't get is, instead of investing in good next generation battery technologies like, Tesla for example, why does these smartphone companies are going the Fast charging ways. Makes no sense to me. What is these use of all these Fast charging if battery keeps on draining so quickly? Anyway, all who intend to buy this smartphone, beware of this issue.

Very bad phone from Samsung , when i connect to charging or when i connect the earphone the phone screen starts lagging 3 times i.have visited service centre but there is no solution , really upset with the phone and front camera is very very bad , every 5000 rs phone has the better camera than M40.

Honest Review,The phone has very good battery life.If you go for camera it is slightly average in home or in night but in day for outdoor it is very good.The processor is very good which helps a smooth gaming experience.For PUBG by default graphics is High.Overall its a very good phone but the price range is slightly high.And considering the specifications There is no Amoled display but if you applying a screen guard can resolve the issue.Camera Quality is Good.And one more thing which disappoints me and all of you is there is no 3.5mm jack and cant get an adapter for it with packing but you get a type c earphone with the product in box.And after all the trust issue is we can trist on Samsung than any other company.But if you want a popup camera rather than punch hole and a more good camera quality you can go with realms x also.

2) Camera - the camera takes good pics in the day light in outdoor conditions

3) Battery Backup - The phone runs for an entire day with Mobile data on and normal usage.

Cons
1) Slippery - The phone tends to slip a bit from my hand.

2) Low light Camera - The camera doesnt give good pics in the low light or night light.

Worst phone by Samsung by far..and so is the endorsement by Amazon.. there is no earphone/speaker... so screen is the earphone..it vibrates everytime the other guy speaks..build quality is worse than the worst Chinese phone. No proper response from Amazon on return. Please don't buy the phone and trust "Amazon Exclusive" again

Gorgeous looking Infinity-O display😍.

Sleek design and easy to hold in hand (recommend buying a case though cuz phone is a little bit slippery).

Would have preferred a speaker grille on top but under display speaker works just fine 👍.

Phone doesn't come with pre-installed screen protector so I recommend buying one.

Sad to see Samsung has removed 3.5mm headphone jack but they resolve the problem by providing Type-C earphones which sound really good.

Battery life has been good on this device although it's not the best out there. Fast charging is a great addition though.

The camera's on this device are great and the fact that we get a triple camera setup at this price is awesome.

The software experience has been great. It's safe to say that Samsung has really leveled up their game from TouchWiz which was a disaster.

The Snapdragon 675 coupled with 6GB of RAM has given silky smooth performance.

Even though people are saying that AMOLED is missing, it's not that big of an issue. The display looks really good with great colours. I assume Samsung dropped the AMOLED in order to reduce the overall price of the device.

Overall for ₹20k this is a phone that is unrivalled at its price range(except if u really care about the 3.5mm headphone jack).

Very very poor camera
Touch response rate is very poor
Display clarity is very good even thought its not Amoled
OS NICE
very worst processor for 20k
Phone is considerably average speed only
Size and form factor good
Finger print reader very slow
Not worth for money
But I bought this phone because it has got very less SAR ratings @ 0.2 and I feel that's more than good reason for me to buy this phone .
But if you are ok with 1.5 SAR ratings plus then prefer Redmi K20 or POCO or Redmi note 7 pro @ this budget

I'm satisfied with the performance of mobile and feels more premium finish.  Battery capacity should be increased. Picture quality is above average. Slight temperature increase is observed which is normal in all mobiles while gaming or running huge number of apps.

For starters, this phone is absolutely beautiful. Sometimes I unlock the screen just to get a look at how astonishingly sharp and beautiful it is, yes, even without an AMOLED display. It feels like a premium device when you hold it and the back glossy finish does not look like plastic at all.

The camera is really subpar. If your priority is camera, go for a different phone. Both selfie camera and back camera could have been much better. They have the numbers, just not the performance.

In terms of speed, I have experienced no lag after a week of usage. Some heavy games like Asphalt 9 might feel glitchy but that goes away quickly.

The fingerprint sensor is a breeze. Although the placing felt uncomfortable in the beginning, I have got used to it now.

I personally prefer the punch hole camera over the centre placed water drop camera. There is some black bleeding around the camera but the fact that it's in the corner makes the phone stand out when compared to other bezel less displays. It's a matter of preference in the end.

The battery life is average. It lasts for a day with regular usage but drains a lot quicker if you're glued to your phone all day like me.

The 3.5mm jack is a non-issue because the phone comes with fast charging.

In essence, I am happy with this phone for now. The camera and battery are just average but the beauty of the phone compensates for it. And the UI is a smooth experience. My opinion: if your budget is 20k, go for it.

Punch Hole Display + SD 675 + 6 GB RAM and 128 GB Storage and many more latest technology in single mobile=M40

I am a blind follower of Samsung Mobile, purchased M40 on it first sale. After 9 days of uses, I am sharing my review so that other can make their decision. Guys it’s my personal experience only.
A very big O M G to Samsung Galaxy M40
• Its Punch Hole display and slim (7.9 MM) design gives it premium look.
• It’s true it does not have Super Amoled Display but definitely you will not miss it because it has awesome PLS TFT display with Corning Gorilla Glass protection.
• SD 675 makes it fast, can play GAME without any lag.
• Everyone love selfie and clicking moment, I am fully satisfied with Main Camera (32, 8 and 5) MP and Selfie Camera 16 MP.
• It has dual band WiFi, latest Bluetooth V 5.0 and NFC (NFC found in flagship mobile only).
• It has all necessary sensors with optimized, quick responsive fingerprint sensor
The very latest technology used by Samsung in M40 is Screen to Sound Technology, yes guys M40 does not have earpiece speaker, it uses Screen to Sound technology. You can hear caller’s voice from its SCREEN only. Voice can be heard from any part of M40 display.
It has only 3500 mAh Battery, it’s good for normal uses.
Overall I’ll give 9 .5 out of 10
I am not professional reviewer, ignore mistakes.
Thanks

Excellent phone for an excellent price. Infinity O display is phenomenal - wide and good looking screen, not really missing out on the AMOLED. Encorporates the Samsung "glance" feature on the lock screen, which is pretty cool. Super fast processor, battery life is good. Camera is really decent, - pretty good quality photos in terms of clarity and depth. Can't complain. Can't get a better phone of this quality, for this price bracket in my opinion. Type c earphones and charger provided in box. Only negative would the the plasticy back, but the color and overall feel compensate for that.

I have never owned a phone which costed more than 12k. So this phone with 6gb ram is like a beast to me.
Best part of the phone are:
1. It was very easy to incorporate all my files and app which I had in my previous phone. Took me around 5-10min.
2. The Design is lovely. Got the Midnight Blue, I had my doubts by looking at the picture in product page, but the looks and design are very elegant.
3. Rear Camera is awesome, Slow-mo was something that got me interested into this phone. This one has a super slow mo capture as well. The pricture quality is crisp and clear. Kudos to the front camera selfies as well. But I have experienced low light pixelated issue. Not sure if this is something setting related.
4. UI is Simple and Neat,....a lot to explore still.
5. I dont game on phone, with calls and youtube, the battery is up for a day and half easily.

So the only thing I found a bit lacky on this phone is the front camera selfie in low light. I took some selfies inside cinema theatre before movie. It was very pixelated.

Overall this a great phone to have for the configuration it has...…... at this price range.

Highly disappointed after the charging socket in the phone malfunctioned within a month of useage. It was repaired under warranty by Samsung Service centre.
Such issues are not expected from a brand like Samsung which is known for its robust hardware.
Barring this malfunction, the phone is very good. Especially the display and camera. Phone has a premium look. Would have given 5 stars if I had not faced hardware issue.

Samsung M40 is supposed to be the unique product considering samsung for first time offering Sanpdragon processor. However it's a complete let down.

Battery backup is extremely bad , a fully charged phone even only gives more battery backup of 7 hrs ( calls and browsing only no games). The phone processing speed is quite slow and lags continuously. Camera also not good enough to take sharp contrasting  pics.

Call volume at max and speaker is very low even at full volume.

Phone looks good and very nice.

Battery not okay they should give 4000 or some good battery optimisation.

Display not bad while campring between amold and other LCD, this is not okay. Because we came across brand trust but now that is not there.

Performance it's okay mid range only.

Why Snapdragon processors while others (moto)are using Samsung processors?

And in my display bottom of navigation bar some light dark shadow is there inside display And inifnity O circle also having se dark shadow.
This is defect or design I'm not sure..

Phone is good but okay to this price. 20k they can give good quality phone

The screen is absolute beauty. Giving the infinity O display for a phone in this price point with snapdragon processor and a whooping 6gb ram the phone is simply amazing. Camera quality is good but with continuous shooting the device heats up. The fast charging also works well and with a full charge the phone survives until the evening with extensive use. The finish on the back is also a beauty, providing plastic back with glossy finish is the way to go for a modern phone. With all other features such as AR emojis, live focus and One UI makes the phone feel premium. The screen sound technology also works well and i have faced no difficulties in hearing. Though there is no headphone jack the earphones in the box are good, so no issues with that.

First of all, I have to mention about the look of the set and it's beautiful. It's stunningly beautiful. The full display even though a bit long does not seem difficult to use and is very much handy. The fingerprint sensor in the back is super fast and responds an instant. I've been using it for a week and the battery life is pretty amazing too. It easily gives 24 hours of usage before the next charge. The camera quality is pretty amazing too. With a triple camera setup I was able to click many good pics and the front camera is very good as well. It has some minor drawbacks such as it has no gesture for taking a screenshot which is common in other phones now. But it can be overlooked. Great phone. Loving it.

The most pertinent issue I'm facing is with the quality of Phone calls. It strains my ear to actually listen to what the other person is trying to communicate. Moreover, its impossible to have a conversation when outdoors.

The other issue is with the quality of camera, both front and rear. The front camera clicks worse pictures than a sub standard 10k phone. The rear camera clicks the dullest possible pictures in every lighting condition. Moreover, the rear camera does neither captures details nor does it focus.

Pros:
1.camera, especially back camera.
2. Screen quality is good

5. Screen touch is flawless.

Cons:
1.phone is locked and not compatible with other countries SIM card.
2.Battery life of worst.. 3500mAH is useless
Many apps keeps on crashing..
3. Fingerprint reader many times doesn't read the fingerprint.
4. SAMSUNG UX is bad. To delete one SmS user has to click at least 3 buttons.. many options are difficult to locate, especially in settings.

The sim slot is always getting break out in to pieces  when I eject it.
So it always wasting my money for replacing.
It's the second time I have changed the sim slot after buying this phone.
The sim slot is made of plastic it is better for the manufacturer to change it in to metal .
So, due to this issue I am not satisfied with this product even though the performance is good.
I recommend not to buy it based on my personal experience.
The quality of camera is very poor.
Battery don't last for 6 hours.

I am writing this review after using 5days:
Pros:
1. Punch hole at this price segment
2. 6Gb ram and 128gb storage
3. Getting premium quality feeling some times because of display..
4. Back camera - Not bad
5. Wide angle shots - good

Cons:
1. In display speaker - it acceptable only if u use inside home or office... but if u r using outside(noisy environment)even in the full volume u will not get what they are saying.... whole phone getting vibration if u use full volume bcas of in display speaker...
2. Battery life - YouTube,  Twitter,  Instagram.. and voice call each 30mins.. this is my basic usage for this at evening I m endup with 40%(10am to 8pm)...
3. Fast changing????? - from 20% to 100% it is taking more than 100mins(around 2hrs)...
4. Polycarbonate back panel
5. Front camera - after taking the image I felt like some one painted in my face(Not natural)...

Its a great budget phone.
1. Biggest plus, it stores your data in india and s korea. Not the other country where your personal data is venerable.
2. Its gives you google cloud storage and not like Chinese phones which pushes you to use their servers.
3. Changing phone you dont lose your data. This was difficult with Chinese phones.
4. Camera, battery, screen quality, voice clearity etc are all good.

Con
1. Fingerprint sensor is slow.
2. Processor is not latest but ok. No other complaints.

This phone is having lots of problems,
1. Speaker is very noisy.
2. Software is getting hang again and again.
3. Phone state rebooting very frequently.
4. Device is getting heating within few minutes only while on call.
5. Amazon is not helping after selling product.
6. Technical team visit 3 times with in 1 week after buying this phone and confirm problem with phone, but still Amazon is helpless to arrange refund.

7. Amazon is only supporting seller Instead of customer to help out feom situation, because they only have policy for seller benefits not for customer benefits.

depressing non sense ear phones... doesnot goes good with high end games, poor battery backup,only one port for charging and earphones, hanged one time  till now ... excellent camera , quite weighted, asthetically good. Value for money for 6gb ram and 128 gb space.
If you are not a high end gamer , this phone is worth buying for this price

Phone stopped charging port after purchase of just15 days... Went to samsung service centre but no help.
They said they dont have spare parts for it.
It has been almost 3 weeks now but still no spare parts no service. Frustrated and helpless I waited for a month or it to get repairs. After working for two days the charging port stopped working again. I am left helpless for a week again as the people they employ in service centres of Samsung are such professionals. To all the people looking for buying it please don’t, it’s a bad investment to get a Samsung phone and a headache of a lifetime. I am finally back to using my old phone and the new Samsung phone I bought is sitting like a duck in a box in my drawer like the professionals they employ in there service centre. Save your money and time. Find some other phone but never Samsung M40 again . Frustrated!!!!

Camera is 32MP,but its working like 8MP of my redmi 2 prime...it is 11nm base but after that the battery draining so fast.
Phone has heating issue.Phone heats a lot while using.
On screen speaker technology is not working properly.The sound of on screen speaker is really bad....in crowded place you can't hear a single word from other side,this is the new technology?
If you want to buy a great phone in this price the please check vivo Z1 pro at least ones,it saves you aprox 2000/-.

Just talked to Prashant (Customer support ) for replcement at 10 :59 PM (08/07/19) and he wass treating me like an ediot. I said clearly that voice quality is very poor and the screen vibrates during call. However, this guy keeps insisting that it's not a faulty product. Don't buy anything from amazon. Speciall electronics Items.

Sopecial request, go with another phones instead of Galaxy M40 and never ever try to buy anything from amazon. They will send you faulty products and insist you to keep the same one.

Never buy online mobile phone from amazon.I buy this product and the piece was faulty.After 12 days its started hang,headset is not detected,screen lock problems occur,when i asked to replace amazon did not replace my product.They told that its not in our policy to replace phone after 10 day but it was inbuilt default from the manufacture side as i asked from samsung care they told it is manufacturing problem in mother borad .So never trust on amazon to buy mobile product because they are not supporting there Customer.

The voice clarity is not being reproduced well and even in slightly noisy environment its difficult to converse without asking the person on other side to repeat a few times. Company should resolve the in call voice problem immediately otherwise, mobile business of Samsung company will be down.

The main problem is in talking. The speaker and mouth piece both appears to be faulty. Since i am not able to listen other voice clearly. Similarly other is not getting voice clearly.
This is the worst product ever Samsung made. Also,the Samsung is not accepting the problems raised and does not provide any solution.

You would be amazed with the quick response that this phone gives while unlocking with finger print or face detection; however this also creates problem when you pick your phone to keep in your bag or pocket and it unlocks everytime. It doesn't have a notification flash light which annoys me a lot of time since I have started missing my pop ups as the phone lies dead whenever I see it. It has in screen sound feature which means that the sound you hear during a call comes from the screen and no dedicated listening space has been allocated. On the contrary, the phone is quite light weight unlike other monstrous and heavy ones in market these days. Moreover the processing speed is quite impressive.

A phone with awesome features.  If someone wish to buy this phone then don't  think twice, this is a real good product.

Drawbacks like No AMOLED SCREEN, NO 3.5MM JACK, 3500 MAH bty

Guys think that TFT screen is alsk good with HD images and also showing live colours..  a cheaper  one than Amoled incase of bkn.

Type C -  headphones , think about the features  almost in all the foriegn  countries  mobile models they were using this so,  Type C headphone will be the  future.

Bty - don't  see the size. Ig is 3500MAH still good. Enoub time to hold the power.

So these 3 drawbacks also not exactly drawbacks...

The experience  i  using this phone is awesome...

The screen sound technology sounds like there is speaker behind the screen and calls are not that clear compared to normal phones with speaker on top.
I didn't find touch to be that grade. Sometime had to tap twice. Adaptive brightness is not smooth, it takes a while to adjust.
Highest volume is not that loud compared to other phones.

So I've been using this for just over a week now.

Pro:

Cost: best cost effective option in this range and features provided, unreal.

Rather going to Vivo or Redmi, I suggest to go for M40.

2. Performance: 6GB RAM and inbuilt memory shows the difference in performance. Even 675 Sanpdragon is fast, not fast like S series or OnePlus but c'mon in this price range this is the best you could expect.

3. Super Slow Mo: I'm just fan of this super slow mo

4. Face recognition and Fingure sensor: like its mention in any promo,  it is next level and it works like charm even in low light (face recognition)

5. Fast charge: it is actually super fast charge, with highest setting and constant use of phone I need to charge it at least 2 times but it's ready to use in no time

6. Also, I love the fact that handsfree are provided with this phone.

Cons

1. Phone heating: if you play game, phone would heat up

2. Camera isn't THAT great in low light

3. Phone is slippery so need to be very careful as cases and screen protection isn't available (quality).

Overall, it's good phone with super results and for budget smartphone if you're confused, go for this phone without second thought much better compared to your Vivos and Oppps or Redmi.

About Battery life I given 4 rating because of 3500 mah. According to me it should be 4000 mah atleast. Apart from that all features is nice. Phone is really impressive with the all new features like punch hole camera in display, triple camera with 32-8-5 is awesome and screen sound technology. Fingerprint is so fast, display is really vivid, look is really premium which makes me feel happy while looking into it. About processor is also so fast with 675 snap dragon. I think this phone provided all features which u need. Please guys buy this phone it will really make u happy after buying.

Seriously first time I'm really devastated with the services of amazon, I've been trying to return this product but they are not taking my matter serious. This phone has lots of Bad battery. Lacks performance, heating issues, no headphone jack, earpiece is under display so the volume is really low n vibrates all the screen when u r on call &amp; camera quality is just poor it's not a 20k phone from any sense. I'm really feeling bad after buying this thing. Amazon please n return it to the seller

Purchased this phone from Amazon using ICICI card and it was showing 950 discount to be provided by vendor , however nothing has been credited till now. Lookwise phone is slim and holding it feels good.Battery has not drained within 24 hours of normal activity till now. The camera quality is just Ok not so great pictures,however the option of 3 lens give better width in photo. The audio quality is good and the processing is above normal but not great as expected. The face sensor is working fine almost 99% times.
While I was traveling the phone got deregistered each time the network changed and this is the biggest problem with all Samsung devices. You need to manually select the operator for re-registration.
Now today it has gone to voice command mode on its own and not coming out of it. Tried restarting but it is still in that condition. Want to return but the validity is over.
Samsung publicity is more and quality less. Do not go for it.

Poor battery doesn't even last for 14 to 16 hours.. mobile heats up for 2 hours on hotspot...even charge is not super fast takes more than 100 mins for full charge...I wanted to return  but stuck with that as the charm of infinity display wore off after a couple weeks ..finger print is okay  but only has 3...I think lots of basic features are missing in launcher..also I haven't got the screen protector which should be coming by default...

I am really very disappointed with this device.
I was using redmi since 2014 and thought of changing the brand in a hope that Samsung might have made some improvements in their devices.  As i switched from Samsung in 2014 to redmi/mi just because of these horrible devices that they make.
But, seriously and honestly saying Samsung has not improved but has downgraded thier quality. Its just the spec's on paper, and that to just for the sake of virtual paper to paper comparison.
I don't know why the hell people on YouTube shows fake photographs that aren't captured from this device.
Do you expect these poor shots from this so called 20k phone with so called 32MP camera sensor. Even the photos from the Samsung galaxy S duos (which i had in 2013) has better picture quality with 5MP camera.
Seriously they are just faking with the written specs but the reality is something which u will get to know after wasting 20K over this.
I am only commenting regarding the picture quality.
I think the screen quality is again not so good...the pictures which were great on my old device (redmi note 5 pro) seems to be low quality on this device.
I am feeling like i have degraded my device....seriously really disappointing.
I don't knw what to say... just don't buy this device.... that too only by looking at the specs.
Live focus is just for the sake of name..i don't even find any difference in that mode and normal vedio shooting mode.
I never reviewed any device on any of the shopping website. But this device has forced me to do so...

its all about NO cost EMI on banks offer
be sure while you buy product from amzon in no cost EMI offer.
bank will charge interest in this offer its a hidden information from amazon.
amazon customer care simply say for EMI details contact Bank. they dont have any information after the product is bought for them.

Performance is nice.
Camera quality  is also good.
Except battery life is for one day.(last 24hrs)
Overall  its good

This budget smartphone is faster at performance. I have ordered sea water blue color and its beautiful- looks 10 on 10. The only unexpected thing is its front camera- its average. So, if you are not a 'selfie person', get this phone.
I have shared 3 images. Image of leaves are taken by rear camera. The teddy holding m4o box is taken by rear camera. Another pic of teddy without box is taken with selfie camera.
Its finger print reader is swift- you just have to swipe your index finger on the reader and you are done.
Sensors are awesome.
Screen view lock system feature is the best, especially when you have a toddler on your side to poke on screen.

It is still good and you can buy it without doubt to capture most beautiful moments of life.
few things the team can fix-
1.There is noway going back when you use few apps. Make going back easy.
2. Navigation issue- please fix this issue. I cannot navigate to my app notifications when i click on them.

It gets heated easily. You can not talk for a long time. You can not hear other persons voice clearly. Hearing other persons voice is a challenge and when we are out then you can bearly hear voice. Battery drains in 5 to 6 hours. Please dont buy this phone. Buy any other phone but not this for sure.

After two days,
Phone looks fabulous.
Build quality very very good.
Speed superb.
Camera very good but front camera has on screen flash which is bad.

Samsung has done so far but did compromise with battery. Battery drains fast though it stays a day long on very normal usage. Though it got fast charging , very very fast charging.

the phone did not provide the least expected job of a phone i.e the calls.
the call quality is very bad, as it has the new technology with screen sound output or some worst technology, the calls frequently gets disconnected , and sounds like as if the other person is on speaker, and our voice is also not properly audible for them
Battery life is not that good, even though i am not a gamer, still not happy with the batter life.
rest finger print sensor as it is at the back not much of use, and hence always using the front screen lock to use it,so its waste
touch sensitivity is good, and is fast
camera is ok, not that great
am a brand lover of Samsung, as all the electronics and all my previous phones are samsung, but this one disappointed a lot, i even requested for returning the product, but they did not turn up and now the status says that the return date is closed.
the delivery was quick and prompt which is the best part.

The worst quality phone I have ever purchased! I bought this as a gift and the screen was broken inside the package - amazon’s good service had it replaced. Lest I knew I am to prepare for the wrath of Samsung Stupidity.

1. The battery performance is on foot! Sometimes the battery gets drained from 100% to 40% only by a 5 minutes phone call. There is not third party app installed, if that’s ever been the case.

2. Listening to music using headset? Prepare to reconnect the headset during every song change. I know not of this kind of sorcery!

3. Call quality. I speak, they speak, but none hears half of the things. It is not the network issue, I tested with my previous phone.

4. Phone heats up while charging. I can understand if normal heating up, if at all that’s normal. But it is not a holdable heat, and with Samsung’s infamous battery blasts!

It’s not been even a month, and the month has become odd for my, all thanks to Samsung and the decision I made to buy this phone!

@Amazon/@Samsung : Any solutions are welcome.

1. Screen sound technology is not appreciable.  Gives worst call quality, less sound &amp; vibrates more. Technology shall be verified before releasing into the market.
2. Black shades found in bottom of display in all M40 phones.
Above problems are not expected from a company like Samsung.

First of all have a doubt if this product is genuine and definitely not worth 20k. The problems are multiple, triple camera of 32mp is a joke. U simply cannot take a clear picture once the sun goes down all pictures after sunset especially in dim light are blurred. My previous J7 could shoot way more superior quality pics. So the camera is basically useless. The speakers can't play full volume coz then it starts cracking and popping (which btw Samsung acknowledges as a feature: shockingly true words of  online service personnel). So the dolby atmos feature is something one can't really enjoy. The ring tones are a pain to the ears and breaks my heart. The auto rotate feature unlike the sound works at its own whim. The battery charge indicator does not show percentage next to it so basically u have to guess or lock the screen. No display on locked mode and hence no clock or notification displayed. I started using my phone 1 week after delivery and hence was late in finding out the problems and thereby missed the return window by 12hrs. Do jot go by the positive reviews given the product is no better than a imitation chinese version which probably comes for 1/3rd the price. The product came 2days later than the delivery estimate shown during purchase which ofcoz after payment was shown a date 2days later which by now has become an amazon thing. After experiencing similar with a lego purchase i havd decided not to buy expensive items on amazon as the customer care washes tgeir hands off by saying its seller's problem. Strongly recommended to stay clear of this product n stpl.

Quality of display is superb,  picture quality is good...camera is excellent..overall the phone is very good and am happy to after buying this phone..features and look of phone is stylish. It is very light weight and handy...also it gives you the  proud feel..while using the m40 phone..I suggest samsung to give battery life of 5000 mah instead of 3000mah

Decent phone with decent specs and performance.
THE GOOD: Display, compact overall size and weight, Snapdragon processors aided gaming performance and HD videos on Netflix by Widevine and Dolby sound tech are good points of this phone.
Battery will last you 8 hours on average use(4g net on all the time)
Cameras are average and deliver good quality videos rather than photos.
On-screen sound tech is not good and have poor sound quality with lot of vibrations on screen.

1. The Phone is heating up very badly
2. The Voice of the person speaking from other side is barely audible.
3. These are very basic and important  issues which we do not expect from a Brand like Samsung
4. As Amazon has 10 days replacement, they are not replacing this product with any other phone. As these basic issues will be throughout in this phone. Really disappointed with Amazon.

After using the phone for 3 months thoroughly, following are my observations.
-Cameras- Average, unable to produce good quality photos. Same applies for the front camera. If you like to take photos anywhere anytime and concerned about quality, a big NO.
-Battery- Poor, a good use would surely takes the juice out of the phone.
If you are a frequent app switcher keeping the display on and/or a gamer, again a NO.
-Display- Sharp, but not crisp. An OK for viewing videos or movies.
-Fingerprint reader- Just fine, not flash quick but not slow either. Once the phone is loaded you'll see fingerprint reader showing slower response.
-Performance- Average. After thorough usage, I find it's way behind the other phones coming at this price. Lags once loaded.
Verdict- For young guys out there, who loves to take the max out of their devices this one ain't for you.
A good gift for elderlies, with a brand tag of SAMSUNG.

Well there is very little to like about this phone so I'll come directly to the worse features.
Lots of phone heating.
Bad UI, unnecessary complex options where u hate it the most.
Don't buy this phone if you talk for more than one hour a day as the voice reception is of poor quality ( in call voice)
Pathetic speakers, battery life is also weak.
There is nothing that I would recommend for this phone even network is an issue on this one.

I bought this phone on june 24. And now its speaker has stopped working, it is not supporting the earphones which were inside the box, battery life sucks. You cannot play pubg in it. It works very slow even if you change the game settings to medium. And all this happened within 2 months. This is not a product in which anyone should invest his 20,000. I am writing this when i got literally irritated from this device.

Being samsung fan

On 19 June I purchased m-40 from Amazon but the phone is not as per my expectations the  voice quality is very poor. There is no voice clarity though which is the main feature the phone was talked

not expected from Samsung 20K product

I am completely disappointed from samsung

Most dissatisfied feature is voice clarity.

I feels this is one of the best handset one could get that is under 20k rupees. A lot of available storage and ram and also a very good camera. The infinity display looks really good and the midnight blue colour goes really well on the phone. Only If you are into playing high graphics games like PUBG it's not the best becoz the processor could have been better than the snapdragon 600 series ....otherwise this phone is just perfect.

I have to charge the battery 2 times a day for normal ( no gaming or movies,  just surfing,  browsing internet as i frequently checks the stock market ) use that also in optimised mode. I have decreased the brightness,  and put in night time mode.
All photos taken is blurry because there is no image stabilizer. Even though good camera hardware image quality is poor...
The screen sound technology is a disaster. Its similar to using speaker mode in normal phones. You wont get any privacy. If u are in a silent room like in conferences everyone could hear what the other person is speaking.

Although the processor is awsome samsung should have provided with a suitable platform to support it....
Not worth at this price..

It is good phone at this price. Overall look is very good. Snapdragon 675 performance is very good. Display quality is very good.  Headphone is superb. Only the problem is the battery backup but it can manage with fast charging system. Display sound technology is also good. After I ordered I watched many online negative reviews but after I got phone found it is good at this price.

Let me start with probs that this phone but will like to share after 72 hours of phone used
Pros
Design is good.
It is not heavy nor to light.
Samsung one GUI is good.Since I don't like Chinese phone gui.
No lag in phone.
No heating problem with normal daily uses.
Camera is decent.
Con
Battery life is not that good.If your phone is more on mobile 4g network then battery will drain very fast.
Face recognition still take time even after Samsung has released a update for the same.
Fingerpint also take noticeable time as compared to its competitors in same price range.
I switched on Airplane mode.After switching back off my phone network didn't came.
Need to restart it.
Apps are not using full screen even I have enabled the settings to use the full screen.

It's a very bad product it doesn't deserve any star. First when it was new only issue was of the UNINSTALLING of the apps as you have to go to play store then search for the app n from there you could do. Later in next 15 days the phone use to get on sleep mode once u dial a number n the volume becomes too low and because of the sleep mode the whatsup audio go deaf one cant hear. Then it started to get hang now.
Once I visited the authorized service center at Irla but no changes just for a day it was fine and later the next day it got to it's original version.

I watched countless reviews before purchasing, and every one said that the battery backup is decent. It was decent too when I was using it out of the box, but after installing the day one update, the battery performance has become horrible. The rest is fine and dandy, but the battery performance disappoints.

Edit: So after some days of use, it feels like the device is a scam. The 170k+ antutu scores that YouTubers were recieving were a sham, or maybe these "reviewers" were given some special units which were beating Redmi Note 7 Pro in antutu. This phone is supposed to have Snapdragon 675, and this is the performance I get? My Moto G5S plus performs better than this phone. Look at the attached camera sample, feels like taken from a cheap Chinese phone. Just too many cons in this device to list, only one pro is the Hole punch. Don't even think of gaming on this phone, PUBG and even light games like Asphalt Nitro are unplayable due to horrible lag. Better go with Note 7 Pro or Realme 3 pro. Thinking of getting a refund.

I ordered the midnight blue variant and it was delivered within two days.

Build quality: looks premium and eye catchy. With punch hole camera, it has futuristic design and definitely looks a flagship phone.

Display: I don't know why people are so high on amoled display but this one's display is quite good.

Performace: With sd675 and 6gb RAM never felt any lag with day to day tasks and light gaming. Also experience with 1UI is awesome.

Camera: Camera does it's job pretty well. Above average for the specs.

Audio: Sound is loud enough and crisp. USB Type C earphones are provided in the box and they are actually good. Also there is dolby atmos support which can be used to enhance the listening experience.

Screen Sound Technology: As there is no earpiece on this phone, the sound is produced by screen vibration during calls. Place your ear anywhere on the phone and you will be able to hear clearly. Indoors there was no problem, but in a little crowded areas the volume is little low.

Fingerprint sensor: It is snappy and accurate. It is very easy to add the fingerprint.

Battery life: Battery life is okayish, but would have been better if there was 4000 mah or more. With youtube videos, some music and some other usage, it drains quickly. But standby time is great. There also are two power saving modes which can extend battery life by limiting backgroud apps which I think is a good feature. And also with 15W quick charger, it is up and ready again in no time. Quick charging can be enabled or disabled from the settings.

Conclusion: At 20,000 rs. this is definitely a steal according to me. I wish samsung comes with more phones in M series like this with improved battery life. Go ahead and get a m40 for yourself and you won't regret.

Amazing product from Samsung in this mid budget range, camera and its features are outstanding. Display is fabulous. Processor and its performance are outstanding, you have n no of apps in background and playing games or watching videos, you won't feel any lag at all. Only thing that could have made better is the battery which could been a 4000mah one like other models, but still one week from buy, being a continuous user of net, social media apps, games, videos, etc.. nearly 24hr battery life is given and no issue of heating up. Also about fast charging, it hardly take 1.5-2hr for full charge.  All together it's an awesome phone to buy.

I have purchased this phone expecting a decent all-round performance because of SAMSUNG and QUALCOMM presence in this phone. But totally worthless product. Very poor camera quality, very poor in call sound and over heating problem is observed withing few days of purchase. And the catch here is can't even return the product as the window for return is closed within few days of purchase. If you call Samsung Customer service they will just tell you to change some settings which doesn't help at all. Overall horrible experience from Samsung. Probably will never go for mid-range Samsung Smartphone. Also this is evident why Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi is doing better business in India, as they take care of their product quality.

I liked this device most because it is a value for money.
It is packed with all latest features, like Punched hole display for Front camera, has wide angle camera on rear which very useful while taking the photos with less distance, USB type-C, 4G sim with VoLTE support, and most delight full is that it is powered with 3500mAh all day long battery (such a powerhouse),

OMG, it has Snapdragon 675, and 6 GB RAM &amp; 128 GB ROM sooooo much space and performs well.

As i said everything is good. But i don't find any difference on Camera side. It is good not bad but i have taken photos with a 16 MP camera and by this 32 MP Camera... It's all same. I used other brand phone's camera's also and finally got the decision that everyone is making fool by the increases MP number . Because camera picture quality most depends upon APERTURE... doesn't matter how many megapixel you increase. That's why DSLR is used otherwise there is no need of BIG lenses.  Look is perfect, Slim, Punch Hole front Camera looks very good. Apps are fast, 128 GB in built memory a plus. 3500 mah Battery should be upgraded to 5000 or 6000 mah.

A NICE SLEEK FONE, DISPLAY, TOUCH SCREEN, OVERALL STORAGE ARE ALL GOOD. AFTER USING FOR 3-4 DAYS I FOUND ITS BIGGEST DRAWBACK TO BE ITS BATTERY WHICH IS ONLY 3500 MAH. IF YOU STAY ONLINE FOR ENTIRE DAY , YOU WILL BE LEFT WITH 10-15% BATTERY OR EVEN LESS. MYSELF, BEING A MI FONE USER WANTED TO SHIFT TO ANOTHER BRAND ,THIS TIME SAMSUNG AS I WAS IMPRESSED WITH M40 FEATURES. LOT OF FEATURES WHICH ONE WILL NOT FIND HERE IS IR BLASTER , NO SCREENSHOT TAKING FEATURE , NO BOKEH MODE FEATURE IN CAMERA. OUT OF 6GB RAM THAT IT OFFERS , USABLE RAM IS 3 GB ,WHICH IS SORT OF OK. WITH 128GB ROM &amp; HYBRID SIM SLOT, ONE SHOULDNT THINK OF EXTERNAL MEMORY SLOT BUT IF THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN OPTION OF , IT WOULD HAVE HELPED SOMETIME LATER. FULL SCREEN OF 6.3 INCH IS FINE , WEIGHT OF THE FONE IS OK. INCOMING RINGTONE SOUND IS QUITE LESS AS THERE IS ONLY 1 SPEAKER, THUS IF THAT SPEAKER HAPPENS TO BE BLOCKED, EVERY CHANCE OF YOU MISSING A CALL. THERE IS NO 3.5MM JACK, IT HAS A C-TYPE SLOT FOR BOTH CHARGER &amp; HANDSFREE MICROFONE. I WONT SAY ITS A BAD FONE, BUT WITH CERTAIN LIMITATIONS , IT COULD HAVE BEEN FAIRLY PRICED BETWEEN 15K-17 K AS WELL.

Please don't but this product if you use basic calling functionality, whatsapp and listen to music.
1.  The voice through the speaker is very unclear. It very distorted and robotic.
2. Whatsapp gets stuck when we video call using ear phones. I can't change the camera to front an back view while on call, cannot mute, cannot pause camera and cannot use text while on call.
3. The ear phones facility in general is horrible. When you listen to music through youtube and them swap to a local music player, then the song playes but you cannot hear anything.
4. The touch is not always sensitive. You may need to click on the icon 4-5 times sometimes.
5. I have once muted the phone because I was in a hospital but when I unmuted and increased all volues to 100%, the phone was still vibrating during calls while showing the volume as 100%!
6. Front camera captures different shared and back camera captures different shades.

It's a near perfect combination of what I wanted in my new phone. I must mention the display and camera are awesome. It captures the real colours and not some fake effects. A larger battery could have been even better. Separate finger print scanner is always more responsive than on display one, the later one is of course more fancy. The only missing thing is a 3.5mm jack.

Best phone under 20k
Pros :
Infinity "O" display gives a premium feel
Slim &amp; light weight
"Camera quality" : Rear camera ia simply superb espevially the ultra wide lens
Buttersmooth UI
Fast charging is superb
Rear |fingerprint reader" works well
Perfomance of Snapdragon 675 processor is really good as expected
No heating issues
Very less SAR value

Cons :
"Battery life" : Battery should have been improved a bit but its ok for a 1 day moderate user(fast charging can compensate)
"Audio jack" : 3.5 audio jack is missing and can't use old earphones(type-C earphone inside the box is of good quality)
Low light image of front cam is a little bit noisy

In total this is a superb gadget under 20k and much better than its competator redmi note 7 pro.It will beat the note 7 pro in all aspects except battery backup.
So if u are a moderate user who give importance to the perfomance of the phone and a super cool UI just go for this one.

Please dont buy this phone. The main purpose of any phone is to talk, and this very purpose is defeated in this phone. Voice clarity is the worst..You hear echo and disturbance when you talk and we have to immediately switch to speaker to hear well. Then what is the purpose of a good phone?? Worst decision to buy this phone for such a high price. Useless is the only word!

You won't be getting any special software which comes in J7 or such, like secure folder, etc, and also you won't be able to install them as Samsung has not provided the required hardware for it. So you will have to depend on third party apps for it. Samsung used its WORST hardware in this phone. Camera is below the quality of Redmi 4 which comes in 8K. So paying 20K for just 6 &amp; 128 GB combo. Rest everything is below average.

Dear Buyers,

In one line i want to say that its a waste of money to buy this mobile handset.

I am using this handset since 12 days, and i am writing this review after full inspection of this handset.

This handset doesn't have the quality equivalent to its value.

Camera- Camera is a worsest part, they are using quad pixel technology with the main camera setup (which is 32 mp in paper) actually this camera is just 8 MP in real but due to quad pixel technology they are claiming that the camera is 32 MP, Its camera quality is worst ever i am not seeing any mobile even under 14k budget of this kind of camera.
no detailing in pictures lots of noise in pics if you want to zoom the photo, please dont try it will gives you a blurry pic like a vga camera.
I think this camera sensor is not even of 8MP.

Battery -  Battery backup is very low, mobile starts heating after some time of use in outdoor. Battery is not going more than 8 hrs.

Mobile Body -  Only after 10 days of use the color of mobile body starts fading (could you believe something like this from a brand like samsung).

Software - Some times it starts lagging if you are opening many apps at once.

The conclusion of this review is please dont buy this phone, you can buy motorola one vision in same range but better in quality.

Built of M40 is good with slim and lite weight.The innovation of punch hole cam and screen sound technology  in this budget phone were awesome,but the front camera quality is average and rear cameras are good with wideangle,livefocus,promode,slomo and superslomo videos.The headphone adapter and backcase might present within the box.M40 will not apt for heavy users due to 3500 mah battery.Both cameras are struggling in lowlight shots without dedicated night mode.The oneUI does good job with more options like onehanded mode,themes,etc.It has retained the memory quickly while using more apps usage due to 6GB RAM.presence of Dual messenger is good.
Actual charging time-150 mins ,which might be less. Fingerprint reader is quick but not the quiker one. we can't feel the place of fingerprint reader without case.widevine L1 certification and Less SAR value are the additional advantages.Audio output is good with both headphone provided within box and bottom speaker.It doesn't has that bad quality of TFT LCD panel which we found on old Samsung devices,this display has good viewing angles,vibrant,brightest among other displays.
It provides some important messages like 1.dust on your cam.lens -before taking the shot
2.your phone had more heated
Devicecare feauture helps to clean junk and cache files.And it acts like a doctor of device.

Never though the decision to chose Samsung over OnePlus/Xiaomi would have such alarming consequences for me in the first month itself.

1. Sound quality while receiving calls is a disaster.
  The vibrating-screen sound technology has neither been tested nor been tuned to actual user-scenario.
2. Stock ear-phone provided with the phone is another disaster.
  While watching video streaming/playback, if there is any notification, the earphone stops working.
  The only way to make it work is unplug &amp; plug again.
3. The incoming call-details doesnt get displayed on the screen if the phone is locked.

Seems like this model was released with "0 quality checks".
Samsung needs to learn a lot and that too at a fast pace from OnePlus/Xiaomi as to how to make phones that dont give nightmares to the end-users.
More importantly, Samsung needs to unlearn its screwed-up QA process.

Yes, I might sound like a Samsung-hater here,but, my previous phone was a Redmi1S that I literally abused for 5 yrs without a single issue.

p.s:
I used Samsung CRT TV for 10 yrs and my Samsung refigerator is 8 yrs old, and have never had a single issue with either of these.
I have realized that I was an ass to expect the same quality from Samsung phones.

I used to Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) for the past 3 years. The experience was very good except the average camera. It was a very good in terms of durability and productivity for intensive use for office work, social media and videos etc. Considering my previous experience with Lenovo decided not to buy China products. Hence, opted for the Samsung Galaxy M40. I am using the phone since 31st August 2019.

Smooth UI, response and excellent display are the plus points.

I use the phone for the emails, news on Daily Hunt, Social Media, and an occasional video. I must say the battery is pathetic. I have to charge the phone twice a day. Battery drains faster than my old phone despite optimization of screen brightness and put the applications into sleep. Also, the phone heats up while charging and also while using continuously

Second major drawback is the camera. Both front and back cameras produce suboptimal pictures not ever average photos. Optiming M40 is my biggest mistake based on the past performance.

Lesson learned
PAST PEFRFORMANCE DO NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE

If anybody already used Samsung higher end phones then I would recommend don't buy it. Processor is big but phone is too slow and lacks many times.
Second of all camera is 32 mp but quality of photos is like ordinary. Some can definitely tell that photo is not from high quality camera. Also camera is very slow to process.
The build quality is moderate. Face detection is slow.takes around 3-4 sec.to open.
The only thing I like is the screen size. Huge and impressive.

Touch sensitivity should be improved as its not responding properly sometimes or not at all and we had to turn off the display and turn on to make it work.
Contacts information should be improved. Currently it doesn't show complete contact profile from the recent calls info bar. Rather we had to go to contacts and open the info to get complete information about the contact profile.
Sometimes I face problems with SiM card manager. It shows as if sim card is not inserted or slot empty but when I turn off and on the sim from settings it will be detected and runs normal. Please fix it.
Sometimes the screen doesn't get locked. I even turned off smart lock. But still the screen doesn't get locked and when I swipe the home screen will be displayed without pin or finger print. Security is compromised.

Everything else is great to experience.

I won't say the product is bad. But there are some software compatibility issues main thing for me is it doesn't support Bixby, the display has a blur edge at the bottom and at the camera circle. Want to return it but unfortunately 1st time amazon refused to return the product. Didn't expected this after having such old buying relation. They should have specified in the specs that it doesn't support Bixby which is a normal app which comes in every samsung mobile. Anyway I m disappointed.

Received a defective item. Speaker produing an unpleasant noise. Front camera is a complete disappointment. one can get a much better camera  quality from honor or other brands in the same price range. Rest everything looks good.  As there is no return option available for mobile phones one has to request for a replacement.  For this also Amazon takes so much of your time. Waiting for my replacement, hopefully it comes soon.

Guys do not purchase the phone for the following reasons

1) Amazon is not providing replacement/return with this phone in short return or replacement policy has been removed by amazon.
2) It has dual SIM dedicated slot but samsung has not provide memory card slot means we cannot use two SIM and one memory card together we can use either one SIM or memory card or two SIM together.
3) Also battery life is weak.

Excellent mobile. Great slick design with highly optimized SD 675 offers great performance and about 24-30 hrs of battery life if you tweak the power management, display and notification settings right. Camera is great with screen optimizer turned off. The punch hole display is crisp and clear unlike A50 / A70 which have grainy AMOLED. The mobile is thinner than iPhone and very slippery without a cover. Just get the higar nillkin cover for this and you'll be good.

The technical team of Samsung says it doesn't support fast charging and its average battery life is 6hr only.Once if you buy this item you can't return it.Fast charging is not much effective, it takes almost 2hr to fill the battery. Camera quality is not good. Some apps like jio cinema doesnt support full screen mode.Overal Look is nice , performance is also good. In the case of network signal ,it is not upto the standard for providing. Touch screen is verry sensitive and good.

I bought this phone in January 2020. Within 4 months, it started giving problems. Battery life is worst and phone is heating when we charge the phone and while using the phone. I don't have any games. While playing YouTube videos also, phone is heating and then started not functioning. Phone gets switched off automatically in 3 hours after charging. Not getting proper response or support from Samsung customer service also.

Audio quality: Audio quality of this device is very bad. The reason maybe there is no visible ear piece. It seems like the person is talking to you from very far away even in the highest settings.

Build quality: Cheat plastic build, it will be evident when you pull out the sim cardholder. Its cheap plastic!

Screen quality: At first it seems fine but when I see against a white background then one can see a black shadow coming out from the bottom of the screen. That is also around the front camera.

Camera quality: Normal camera seems ok but the wide lens is not good.

Battery quality: It takes more time to charge and the battery drains rapidly while watching video

In all the cons, the audio quality is the main problem with this phone.

I called Amazon for the return but the agent said they need to verify that with a technician before a return. That's very discouraging. Nobody buys a product just to return it without a reason.

Major concerns the most of the buyers are talking about:

a. Camera hardware is much more capable but the real problem is with the camera app image processing.

b. It is not the battery hardware that is causing low battery life.
In One UI you have a lot of battery life extending options but on this device just to make the performance much more smooth none of them enabled by default.
So make a few adjustments and you'll easily get more than a day battery life.

Make these few adjustments and you'll get to know what a beast this device really is:

1. For Camera:
If you are not happy with the camera, install GCam and enjoy the real camera capability of the device.

2. For battery:
Enable dark mode.
Use 'adaptive power saving' in power mode.
Use 'sleeping apps' option in battery settings in device care.
Set the network to '2G only' for the second sim.
Use a black wallpaper for both lock and home screen.

The phone is good. Battery is fine. Processing is lag free. The only shortcoming is the software used in the front camera, the colour gets all flushed, but again it's a software issue, so it will be fixed in one or two software updates. Except for that the phone is worth purchasing if you want to show off the Puch hole design, and slow motion. It offers a very immersive viewing experience. Again, you can't play pubg in the full screen, and many apps are not optimized for the display, but with time and software updates, it should get better. Front camera is below decent thou. The makeup that is not necessary is added, buy why??

This is the most painful smart phone I have ever had.  After 4 months of use by take is: sub standard product for brand name of Samsung.
Pros: weight, looks, response time
Cons: Battery life,  Camera, slot for headphone

Need to charge phone twice a day. Camera is average and doesn't meet standards of specs - 32MP triple camera. No 3.5 mm jack. You cannot have phone charging as well as being on headset at same time. Forget about your office calls on this mobile. Not friendly when on bed. Slips from hand, doesn't rest on side table and because of non brainer placement of earphone slot, forget having a peaceful conversation or watching videos. Waste of money. Many other better options available.

Worst phone I have ever used. Waste of money. Don't buy.

I thought Samsung will have good performance.

But this phone not working properly. Every time asking to insert a sim even it has sim. Again and again have to restart the hand set.

After serving also same problem repeated. No use of giving service centre.

I lost my 20k with this phone. It Doesn't worth a single penny.

Brought 3 sets of M40 for my family members together. But just after 1week all the handsets started showing some weird issue. Like sometime ringing would come but call attending screen is not visible, battery drops from 100 to 20 as soon as charger is removed, while hearing some songs audio keep cutting in between.
Seriously better to stay away from Samsung now.

Not as good as expected. Display is average. The camera picture quality also not so good compared to other phones in this price range. Battery life is really bad. Hardly with stands for 12 hrs with power mode on. My 2 year old One plus 5 battery holds better than this brand new phone. The most annoying feature is the on screen ear phone for calls. The voice clarity is not at all good. Not worth the money in this range.

The phone does not have a 3.5mm slot for the headphone jack. If you are used to using wired earphones you will not be able to use earphones and charge the phone at the same time. The phone does ship with usb-c type earphones though, and you can always use bluetooth earphones if you are ok with using them.

The Fingerprint sensor often times doesn't work or requires me to wipe my finger as well as the sensor 1-2 times before working. As a person who prefers using a long password instead of a swipe-pattern, this can be annoying.

The battery life is only 3000 mAH , which is just enough to get you through the day provided you do not play games for extended periods of time.

Even though the screen is LCD, it is very crisp and bright. If you use your phone in the dark, the screen is relatively bright even after sliding the brightness slider all the way down to 0.

I Like Egronomic Design Of This Phone, which comes with bezel less and 0 notch display. The colour is the favourite part and also the serene colour options; mine is seawater one!
The camera is 32+16mp but it should be 48+16mp. The battery is where I disappointed; they must've given 4000mAh-4500mAh and then the camera quality of 32+16mp would be justified. Also it heats up after 30-45 mins of continued usage😵!!!

I would suggest all to buy A80, A70s or M30s 😊😊😊

Generally, I go easy on things and tend to ignore minor shortcomings. Though this phone seems to be a big mistake. The main feature of any phone is to talk. Audio quality of the phone is too bad. You could hardly hear what other person is saying and your voice is not audible to other side. This happens 5 out of 10 times. I highly suggest not to waste your money on this phone.

Its jarring to listen,while on the call. Display sensonr is not working, when you dial for a call. Need support quickly from samsung services pleaseeee. when approched Samsung service center, they are happily saying motherboard issue. will change the motherboard at the use less than two months, it shows the credibility of the product. i have asked for replacement, but they are saying, they will change the motherboard. upon calling Samsungs' service.center, no proper response. They making me wait for a long to speak to the seniors, not a single time i could get them. Boldly, they say, we will arrange a call back. will certainly go to consumer court on this issue, if not replaced. Amazon, is also take.responsibilities, as they do take revenue from the sales. Any one else, on this issue, pls post it...

The Samsung M40 is an amazing phone. Infact  I was a bit surprised that Samsung could offer such a brilliant device at such a low price. The 6 GB Ram and the Snapdragon Processor is perfect for all my games which includes PUBG. Plus the Graphic Card provides you with mindblowing picture quality. The camera is super awesome and clear. I absolutely fell in love with the Infinity O display. It does not hinder your gaming at all. Infact it looks pretty cool. The speakers of the phone are also pretty loud and clear. The fast charging is definitely a boon as it allows you to always be on the go. 3500 mah is not less as many people think. I think this is the perfect budget phone for a teenager like me.

Voice quality very poor, hear double sound , plus phone does look like Samsung product , worst product in the name of Samsung, Amazon doesn't have a exchange policy,  even after inspecting the phone and accepting the bad voice quality, Amazon is not ready to exchange it saying it's a manufacturer defect and cant be returned,  They say it's a new technology, phone doesn't have  a receiver and sound generates and vibrates from display, Absolutely dissatisfied with the product and in unprofessional approach of Amazon, Finally I had to sell it in the market value for lesser price, Buying phones from Amazon strictly not suggested. They seems to have different policy for phones and finally sufferers r the consumers purchasing it. Sad and shame Amazon.

To be told in one word... Beast 🔥🔥
Everything is awesome with the phone. Earlier , I have read few of reviews and worried about the lack of 3.5mm jack. But , nothing to worry guys... The earphones provided are best . Of course , everyone switched to Bluetooth now a days...
Camera.. is good in day light.. you can capture the best if you are taking pics in the right way. Front camera also runs well..
Believe me , played pubg and asphalt 9... Not even a single lag guys .. not even a single one.. phone's temperature was also normal..
Then.. The Snapdragon processor is running in  the smoothest way.. multitasking is excellent.
The back side, sea water blue is COOL. Simply COOL. Gives an awesome and descent look.
Since it comes with a Gorilla glass,nothing to worry. But better put a tempered glass. Phone's a bit slippery, I suggest a solid silicon case to protect it...
Honestly I really loved the product and thanks to Samsung and Amazon.

First, let's talk about good things
I play heavy games with minimal disturbance, design looks elegant as far as other phones in this price range are concerned, I like camera of this phone also and fast charge
Now talk flaws
Sound quality is pathetic bcoz of on-screen speaker worst experiment by samsung, battery drains as fast as it gets charged, there is no 3.5 mm Jack in this phone which had to be present as this has so called on screen speaker.
Personally I would not recommend anyone to buy this phone and I bought it bcoz I only use samsung and I ordered it the day it was on amazon.

This device has some heating issues, fingerprint sensor is not very responsive battery drains fast &amp; face detection is not that great either.
I don't know what material is used in back side but scratches can be seen even after carefully using it for two days.
However, it looks very nice, very slim and lightweight. Camera is very good, touch and display feels premium.
In display speaker thing doesn't feel very useful, as you have to keep volume on higher side to hear the other person on call, which make the conversation audible to other people seating near you.

I purchased  Samsung  M40 as low budget phone  will have all features  like Oneplus7  but after ordered  Samsung  I realized it was a huge mistake as all pros and cons I'm writing.
Cons.
1.On call phones creates background or vibration  sound  which you will hate soon.
2.NFC feature is main issue which I'm facing as its malfunctioning  with NfC sensor  used for TYPE-1 Diabetic.
3.Heating issue.
4.Battery is very  poor you need to Charge every day.

Overall I tried to return the product  or exchange  with Oneplus7  but Amazon  is helpless to help his customers, as I'm 7 yrs of good experience  with Amazon  but all waste by buy Samsung  M40.

Never ever buy from Samsung!!!

Pros:
Speed
Touch response
Wide angle lens (rear) is superb if you really looking for landscape shots.
Sound from the screen is good (though you feel it vibrates)
Lowest SAR value (.2)
Feels good in the hand (less weight) and premium looks.
Patches and updates
Samsung's support.

Cons:
Face recognition is just ok.
Camera quality is also ok.
Battery lasts barely for a day. (Mixed usage)

Flop, waste, cheating , not worth, bad mobile.

Sound is not good while receiving calls. You will not hear anything properly , getting some vibrations,  voice can hear from the well kind of echo. I have replaced the one which I bought then they gave another mobile which also having the same problems. I tried to replace this time  but Amazon is not ready to do that , what a good deal? You can replace only one time if you have the same problems you have to live with that. Good policy! I hope Samsung top management should read and provide solution,  I really don't know why Amazon is giving this product on online,  my fate to buy this product . I enabled face recognition and tried for 5 times , battery dried immediately from 90% to 15%

Phone looks slim and elegant very hand to operate too...camera is good not like the best but ok types,4k video recording,slow motion video recording and hyperlapse vedio recording are the best part of camera features,face recognition is not up to the mark, battery backup is not so great ofcourse it comes with 15w fast charger Samsung definitely can improve better here by giving 4000 Mah atleast and by spending 20k Customers deserve for 20w and above fast charger,typeC ear phones are good produces good quality sound output...Samoled display might be the other important feature that Samsung is not offering for this phone ,so M40 display screen is not upto the mark in this price range...the main reason I bought this phone is security purpose we can rely on Samsung better than Chinese phones and the next thing is SAR value is just 0.200kw/g which is  very good thing, since I do get more calls every day so this phone helps me with better radiation than other h
20k budget phones..am not fond of video games so am not going to comment on it... speaker phone I good but it can be better...
Overall it's good but slightly over priced or else Samsung have to improve those cos like battery size,charger, display,face recognition

This is a pathetically designed phone from Samsung. I have used so many other models from Samsung, but this is just so bad. Techncially, battery drains out like hell. There is no punched holes on phone to hear while taking calls. Voice is generated inside handset and makes hearing very difficult. I wanted refund or replacement for phone, but Amazon denied it. It's a brand new phone and i am facing so many issues. I am not buying any further handsets from Amazon. Better ti buy from Samsung directly.

Hi I bought this Samsung Galaxy M40 overall this phone is good but there are few things I would like the Samsung to improve it and those are,

1- "Face unlock"
While unlocking the phone through face recognition after you show your face it should open and the home screen should appear but in this case it's getting unlocked but again you have to swipe the lock screen then only the home screen appears.

2- "Phone startup speed"
 Once you restart your phone when the phone is switched ON it take few seconds to start mentioning that your phone is starting. When as it should be little more fast ..

3- "Camera quality"
The front camera of the phone is not as clear as it should be compared to 16MP because it looks like there is a inbuilt filter added to the camera and mostly the pictures clicked are coming whitish.

4- "Battery Life"
As u see the battery is 3500 mAH it's draining out a bit fast n doesn't even last up to 24hrs when ur mobile data is on and I am a very moderate user hardly 10 calls a days and a bit of social media exploring.

Got a defective product. Front camera wasn't working properly. It was capturing shakey any blurly images. After long struggle and talking n no. of calls with customer care, I had return initiated for this product. I wsnt expecting such a poor product and irresponsible, uncustomer friendly approach from amazon

The phone is fast, the face unlock and the touch have decent feedback, probably could tweek the touch response time but nothing to worry much about, the display is amazing and colorful and the phone though has a big screen is kind of sleek to hold on too, also supports one handed user interface, so thats a plus
Battery is fine for me, it lasts a day and a half, I'm not into hardcore gaming, even if i do play, probably and hour or so of pubg mobile or fortnite mobile, although I'm connected youtube and social media all the time  the battery has been really decent, the camera quality is supreme, natural light photographs are the best, i really like the wide angle camera, also i don't really need to click low light photographs so low light photography performance dosen't matter.
The no headphone jack is fine for me too, since I'm mostly connected via bluetooth headsets, rarely used wired ones in my old handset too, so dont miss it as such, however samsung has done nice to provide Type C headphones in the box. I would have loved if they would have provided a transparent case with the handset too.

I own this and it's like a month old so here's my review.
camera: triple cam 32mp shots good and wide angle shots too good outside environment.
front shooter's bit less quality since I've used tamper glass on the screen hence the camera.
processor: Impressive 675 snapdragon for Samsung device. Samsung's known for bad and laggy processors in its midrange lineup but the ram managements pretty good with this one with 6gb of ram and about 110gb usable storage makes it worth considering.
battery: comes with small nimble 3500mAh but trust me it lasts long for day with small usage since sd675 is pretty power efficient.
Not that heavy even after slapping a case in it. Inside the User Interface is so good.  I personally prefer OneUI over colorUI, MiUI, EMUI or funtouchOS, since I've used others (many of them UI come with ads).
But you're paying bit extra for Samsung  "brand"

The battery performance is very poor and it is taking more than two hours to charge 60-80% and definitely this is not what a individual/Customer is looking from technology giant Samsung and also the sound output is very ordinary where other brands are providing exceptional sound quality. As I am a valuable and proud customer of Amazon I'm definitely looking for solution(exchange) for this problem.

Great smartphone. Packs a ton of features.

Complains? Yup. The camera is really bad. It's all because of Samsung's software that just softens everything and takes away details. Colours are oversaturated. Nothing that a software update won't fix.

It's a great looking device. I love the punch hole design. Everything is layed out pretty conveniently except the fingerprint sensor. It's a pain in the ass to locate without a cover on.

Performance wise, it's a Snapdragon 675. So no qualms there. Handles gaming like a champ.

All in all a good purchase if you're willing to trade in camera performance and screen quality for Samsung's after purchase services.

1. Camera is below average, when zoomed it just messed up...but after updates it becomes just awesome.
2. Batery life is just ok.
3. Gaming on this phone is very awesome with no lags at all.
4. No heating issue.
5. Speaker is also fine...crisp and clear sound.
6. Calling is also fine.
7. Built quality and feel is premium.
8. No earphone jack but you'll get earphones with it.
9. Earphone quality is just amazing.
10. UI is also great with no lags and frame drop.
11. Besides its TFT display the display is actually very great...vibrant colors and immersive.
12. Front camera is average.
13. Value for money rating is 8/10.
GO FOR IT

This is with regards to the product M 40 that I bought from Amazon.

I have been facing the issue of faulty earphone. I'm not able to hear anything clearly and it's more of echoing voice that comes out.

In noisy surrounding, I can't hear anything and it's difficult to use the phone that performs so bad in the basic necassity feature that the phone needs to have.

I tried contacting Amazon customer care and they are asking me to go to the service centre. The issue is that the product comes with a weeks replacement warrant and they are not Co sidering it.

I do not want to go to the service centre where I would loose the option for refund/replacement.

Please either refund my hard earned money or send over a replacement

The battery is very pathetic and just dies down intermittently. In past 40 days we are getting  battery dead auto switch-off for 3rd time in a row, its 10 days downtime and still in service center no use approaching COE deck, they see you as burden for 20,0000 invested, even 5,000 phones work more reliable.  The pathetic, insensitive and cold customer  service is making us lose trust in Samsung brand. Today 29 Aug its 16 days down with service center due to lack of parts and head office is still discussing on how to resolve , Its too much unorganised n unprofessional.

Firstly I would give 2 star for Amazon Services. I bought this phone on no cost emi along with an additional order of Bluetooth. Amazon was not abke to deliver the Bluetooth so it cancelled my order from their side. Along with this they also cancelled the no cost emi on my mobile phone which is really disappointing. I ordered this phone just because I was having an option of no cost emi. But sadly they cancelled from thier end. Have contacted Amazon support thrice but it was of no help. Worst service and support by Amazon.

Phone is really good. It's looks, dimensions, performance is much good. Battery life is awesome. It lasts for complete day, Sometimes two days. Apart from this, the cons are very less. To be specific, I would rate earpiece 2 out of 5. As sometime it becomes really difficult to hear as voice is too low. Since the earpiece is in the display, the voice is scattered and not centered. Due to this, sound spreads around and people nearby are abke to hear.

This review is after using the mobile for about 3 months. At the price of below 15 thousand along with Samsung's backup it's an awesome phone. The performance is good and didn't find any lag in it. The battery holds good for a day with optimum to above average use without any high end gaming applications.
Cons.
The auto brightness adjuster is slow and doesn't adjust rapidly to the environment
During calls after dropping the call the screen doesn't light up automatically and always we need to use the power button.
The unlock feature must have auto open after phone unlock password is hit or face is recognized.  But always we need to swipe or press ok to unlock the phone. This was not a regular feature of samsung phone which I used earlier.

Im using samsung phones with different models  from past 9 years, nver had any issues in the initals but this phone today I have been recieved and started with some problem. First of all Finger print is not at all working properly and the sound clarity is very poor then Camera, though it contains 3 cam still stuggles to give clarity, battery average and 1 best thing is perfomance, very smooth and feels good to use the phone.

Finally never had this kind of worst experience from samsung phone. Very bad.

Which means the product has been sitting with its battery 50% charges for more than 8-9 months. That affects battery life. Whats the point of purchasing a phone in February 2020 then?

One of the worst camera in this price range. Any other budget phones less than 15000/- or 10000/- has better camera than this. I am still fighting with Samsung Service Center for the camera color reproduction issue, and Samsung is not very supportive in solving the problem. Just 15 days still not have any resolution.

I don't recommend any Samsung device from my personal experience.

I would like to start with the phones look,which is impeccable though its plastic body but it doesn't even look like one moreover everyone's phone wears a security phones cover so it hardly matters its plastic or metal secondly if I talk about the camera it's amazing,triple back camera with amazing front camera makes it more suitable for selfie lovers. 6GB ram with 128GB internal memory doesn't make ya phone lag anywhere. Only one drawback is u can either use second sim or the memory card, it doesn't support the on screen finger print sensor but it has a finger print sensor at the back but it has face recognition on the contrary but phones look nullify it all. It has everything what you can expect in 20k phonebattery life is like you need to charge once in morning the battery lasts for good 10- hours full use, In short I will give 9 out of 10 for every feature I would recommend a must buy if you want to buy a phone in this budget

This device is awesome on every prospects in this price range looks too good.

First I had reviewed this device on different tech expert site and thos device good to go

Having snapdragon processor in M series
Ram 6 GB device runs super cool
Rom 128 means you need not to add sd card
Samsung screen resolution excellent no doubt
No lack seems in this device
If you are planning good to go
New technology used for sound come behind the screen
Type c chaging and audio Jack same port
You can connect charger either way this means you don't need to see Jack position is correct or not
I believe this will help who are looking for this device

Camera:
1. Rear: Good quality rear camera, performs well in low light areas. The best thing is the wide angle camera which covers a good amount of the area but sometimes I see few objects get stretched in wide angle mode.
2. Front: Good front camera but auto smoothening of the skin can be seen in front camera, Good thing we have wide angle option for front camera which will give you good group selfies.

Performance: it comes with 6GB ram out of which 3GB ram can be used, performance has been really very smooth you won't see any lags or delays in opening apps.  You can use for high-end gaming without much hitting issue.

PubG: Good mobile for PubG lovers, no lags, no hitting issues. Samsung gives you inbuild game launcher app which allows you to record gaming video, take screenshots, manage notifications, etc. so now can manage your notifications and phone calling while playing PubG.

Design: This is one of the best things you will get with a mobile, excellent front camera in display gives it a different look. Mobile is very lightweight and slim in design. The back panel also well designed and give you good grip and excellent look.

Battery: This has been an area of problem for this mobile since it comes with 3500mAH lithium-ion battery it drains fast. 4000mAH should have done great justice to this mobile, but anyways this supports fast charging so does that solves a problem for me.

Screen: Great touch gives you a good experience when using it, On-screen sound is really cool but sometimes you might feel some problem in listing on phone calls, bit difficult to you in mobile in sunlight even in high brightness mode but overall I like the display and punch hole front camera is really well managed you will never fell it comes in between of your apps.

First of all thanks to SAMSUNG for making this wonderful device. The design at its best and better than other brands. I checked other device in this price segement at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for M40 and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.
Pros:
1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, Samsung has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.
2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. M40 with the punch hole display with the such small bezels screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. It gives premium feel just like Samsung S10 series.
3. Camera: Looks like the image is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. Its fast and works extremely well.
4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all. If you are a heavy user it will last a day for sure.
5.Charging: Type c charger provided in box is good and does charging rapidly.
6. Performance: We have seen this Snapdragon 675 chipset in redmi note 7 pro. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance.
7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear.
8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.
9. Face lock is fast and finger print is faster as well.
10. No heating issue even if you use it for 2-3 hours of gaming nd other usage.

Cons:
1. Hybrid sim slot

Just 1 cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.

I have been using this mobile for a week now. It has6GB RAM and 128GB internal memory. Storage and display is good.  It looks same as S10E, but Quality wise it’s very delicate. You will get the plastic on the backside which I personally didn’t like it. When it comes to performance, 70% of the time it hangs. Some times Sound goes on mute. You have to restart it rest the phone to get it fixed. Overall definitely not worth 20K. You have lot of options which might be better than this.

Display 5/5
Great infinity o display with vibrant quality colors
Speaker 4/5
Main speaker have very good sound
Plus the Dolby atoms make earphones experience amazing
But on screen speaker  doesn't  sound very clear
Spec 5/5
Smooth running from last5,6 few days
Used in a very  light manner
No hanging till now
Camera 4/5
Again not so great camera  by Samsung but quality  is good if it is not great
As by front camera it gives extra blurr and light in background
And the main pair of camera is little upward from the back of phone
The lens cover  may damage soon by scratch
But you can use a good cover to handle it
Design 5/5
You will love it handling in your hand
So slim and light weight
No bezel  and infinity display  makes the look amazing and stylish
personally  I don't like the midnight blue colour but still is shines and give premium look
Battery 4.5/5
The only thing has make me disappoint is the charging speed
The 15 watt charger is not so fast as it gives 70% in 1 hour
But the 3500mah battery runs all day long smoothly
And it only consumes 60 to 70 % in whole day
Sensor 4.5/5
Here I miss the touch on screen reply
You need to use fingerprint  which is very very fast
Or press the lock button to ai face recognition that is very smart and fast.
User interface 3.5/5
I thought  it would be good to use new ui but it is new or what
I am little uncomfortable  with this ui
Hope so I will be compatible  with it in near future
Overall I m falling in love with this smart device ...
It's a good choice in this range that I have made

Pros and cons for buying m40
Pros- comparing it with its other competitors in this range say real me 3 pro , redmi note 7 pro, or even samsung a50 this phone has go the best look , it is the lightest amongs the all, it is the slimmest amongst all, feel good in the hand and even give a premium feel compare to others...other phones literally feel like a  brick in your hand..
Compare to real me and red mi....
-it has one ui better then the operating systems use in above two
-It has gestures involved giving a premium feel when we use it
-color the seawater blue color is at par the best u vould see onany phone...
-the infinty o display again gives a mini s10 feel
-although being a lcd the colors of samsung are much more vibrant and real then the others.
- brightness if the phone is much more then the others
- includes Dolby atmos improving its sound

Compapring with a50
- storage is more 128gb a50 does not provide storage above 64gb
- processor is better being snapdragon675
- overall looks the points i included above are applicable here also...

Cons-
- Battery life is small but the 15w fast charged is amazing...charges the phone fron 0 to 100 in 1 hr 20 min..
- camera quality..u can look upon some YouTube videos ti compare every phone camera has its pros and cons...overall canera is average....but for a normal in routine photography its serves the purpose well and good...
-i read people writing voice geard is low its not like that...just clarifying the point the sound of the incoming call comes from the in display speaker but still u got to place your ear  on the top to get the best quality however its good where ever u put it..

Overall i would definetly recommend  this phone to or the following reasons-
-premium look
-premium feel when u use it
-best in class color
-infinity o display feels unique
-gaming experience was awesome no lag experienced while playing pubg or asphalt 9
- no heating issues
-fast charging

1. Camera: The phone's stock camera overexposes pictures. Using Google camera can resolve that issue. Front camera is not bad either.
2. Battery: Fast charging but not the best. Good enough. I couldn't get through a day with full battery while using 4G &amp; Bluetooth but it's still well optimised.
3. RAM &amp; processor management: Hasn't faced any lags till 1 week of usage.
4. Screen: It has TFT display which is also good.
5. Speaker: Slightly less when compared to others but it's loud and clear.
6. Fingerprint: Sometimes not fully responsive, maybe because of the silicon case.
7. Heating issue: While gaming the phone heats up seriously. Bad experience while playing Pubg performance wise too.

They haven't provided a case in the box. The earphones are in-ear types which have bad bass.

SAMSUNG the name that every phone company fears and yet it has prroved itself again by beautiful series of smartphones into thee budget criteria for every normal citizen who dreamt of a snapdragon processor but couldnt purchase one due to over the roof prices Samsung the ever trusted company which phones you can repl on as it has gained trust of people through the course of time
Samsung M40 is no exception!
The beautiful punch hole OMG display with a truly reliable processor with a truly good camera in the budget section with hyperlaspe and slowmotion capabilities doesn't leave us without a smile without an second thought of putting into our money for this
I wish samsung to maintain this quality forever

The design is good and sleek and the phone feels light too.
The OneUI is quite good and smooth and also includes the dark/night mode which I really love.
The rear triple camera setup is just okay. You can get 32mp only in one mode and in that too pictures are not very clear. Although the front camera is quite good and can take pictures in portrait mode too.
The battery is just okay and would harely last a day with moderate usage. It give a screen on time of around 4 hrs.
The punch hole camera looks great and gives a premium look to the phone.

My phone is getting heated during conversation.The app is running very slow.
When i contacted the amazon technical team ,they are just giving idiotic advise and did not provide me any solution at all. Every time they are just using the hit and trial method to provide solution.
They are doing false promise of 10 day replacement,this is the worst experience of amazon brand.

Me and my friend purchased this new Samsung  phone. and with minimal use the screen has got shattered. We've used Samsung phones previously and this is the first time we're saddled with such a fragile and flimsy model. It seems I have spent my hard-earned money on a substandard device. I'm so upset. After saving for 2 years I saved enough to buy this and along with the screen my dreams and hopes have been shattered to small small pieces. You people have no value for my sweat and tears. You're associating with such a poor and cheap model and losing the trust of loyal customers.... I'm definitely not going to buy any Samsung devices ever....

Not good.Cannot hear calls clearly. Lot of vibration heard when receiving or making calls. Amazon does not have refund facility and only talks of replacement. Tech support decision will be final and they expect to say device is fine only. The app installed to check diagnostics says 8 GB ram where as actually it is 6gb which proves their diagnostics app is also flawed

Camera is too smoothy . Afterctaking pic image is too shady .worst sharpness .this is not a premium one .juat having a camera .only one advantage is good looking in punch hole display .and samsung brand in low cost .while calling display vibrates and it emits heat .yhen after taking 30 photos continuously phone is getting too hot in back top corner.then finger print is okay when you use back case .face unlock is too slow and now i thinking they are working in update .in my point of view its okay to buy for 6gb ram 128gb rom . And for normal use its okay .gaming is good but heating issue is there .

I am giving this review after three months  of usage. This phone contains  a bug nd has charging  issues. I have taken the phone twice  to service center and paid 1500 charges for that. Samsung is a cheat on this model M 40. U can check it yourself. Worst phone of my life

So....I'm using this phone from past 10 days.So here is what I feel about it...I've seen many negative comments regarding phone's on display sound technology..well what I feel is..the voice of the other person is clear and audible even in traffic. Camera clarity is good but could have been better.....phone's charging is really quick...but if you are using your mobile with net throughout the day then battery will last long upto 9-10hrs...I haven't faced any hanging or heating issues yet....the biggest drawback is phone doesn't have 3mm jack which means you cannot charge and listen to music at the same time..but still 3mm to type c converts are available in market which you can use to make the earlier thing possible....hope this helps!! Thank you 😊

I'm facing below two issues since day 1 :
1. Clicking on facebook notification is not lending to the the facebook app, it doesn't opens Facebook App at all.
2. Clicking Inshorts notification is not lending to the news shown in notification, even it lends to the 1st news everytime.

I have tried writing many times to support, but not getting any resolution.
They are just asking me to update latest base band version, which is already updated.

Don't know what type of testing has been done on this phone, as this is not the device specific issue, this issue persists for all the devices of this model as one of my friend is facing the same issue as i'm.

SPEAKER / AUDIO is the biggest concern. Might, it be a new technology of audio behind the complete screen instead on the phone head, but its completely not audible if you stepping outside, mainly on roads where their is little noisy. Also its getting echo while on open speaker without headset. Phone is good when we use on headset, but its not possible to be on headset every-time &amp; wherever we GO. Except Audio, rest all features and Quality of this Phone is good, only disappointed on the Audio. However, THANKS to Amazon to return the money considering our request post delivering the replacement item which has the same issue.

In my opinion, the Samsung Galaxy M40 is one of the finest smartphone in its price range. The phone offers latest punch-hole display, a stylish design and a sufficiently powerful processor for Rs 19,990. The camera performance isn't the strongest in its price range, but fairly good overall. The phone is a delight for mobile gaming users and it offers latest software experience out-of-the-box. What it misses is a 3.5mm audio port, but Samsung ships a USB Type-C earphones in the box. But I would still call the Galaxy M40 a good mix of hardware and software from Samsung, which didn't let me miss having a flagship phone.

Pros-
1.Fast performance
2.Excellent Display
3.Good camera quality
4.Good battery backup
5.Lightweight
6.Excellent security by fingerprint and face unlock
7.Good design
8.No heating at all

Cons-
1.No 3.5 audio jack

Overall  best in price..

You can go for it blindly..

Reviews after 10 days.
Pros:
1. Fingerprint reader is very quick and fast responsive.
2. Camera quality of rear camera is excellent specially am loving wide angle camera performance you can take group selfies.
3.Display is also good with punch hole display you can take premium feel in this price segment like s10 plus.
4. Battery life is also good but it can be improved with 4000 mah as is it 3500 mah overall battery backup is good in normal uses it gives full day performance.
5. Audio/Video sound quality is loud as enough as it have only mono speaker at bottom.
6. Design built quality is awesome.

Cons.
1. We can get a better display in this range as Samsung A70 super amoled display.
2.Front camera can be improved with software updates as it produce more whitening skin tone but for selfie lovers it can be good no need of editing the pics after taking selfie they can directly upload on their social media.

Phone, Configurations were good, but they could have provided Amoled-display instead of IPS LCD, this feature is a major drawback, we can feel it when we use and Battery 3500mah is bit low , heavy usage or game play drains Battery fast.

Apart from that all were fine

Basic quality of any smartphone or basic model phone is Call quality. Now a days, telephone industries are advertising and marketing only for triple camera, Amoled scree, battery this much and that much and , RAm Capacity and memory capacity and worst part is selfie camera. Does any one focus on call quality which is primarily basic quality of phone. Being a samsung user for a very long time, with lot of hope, i got this phone. I can speak only by putting speaker.when you are alone in a room with pin drop silence also you cannot hear what others speak over the other end. Literally both oncoming and outgoing call quality is terrible. Please think before getting this phone.

Purchased the handset  during  prime day sale..The phone  build quality is awesome and really like the wide display. On screen  sound technology is super and honestly the voice clarity is great. I was reading  some user reviews  before  buying  the product  also confused  but now I am happy after  using M40..Samsung has lunched  a stylish  handset after  a decade....just go for it..

Pros:
1. Phone display,this looks pretty good within this budget. Definently punch hole looks better than notch display.
2.Fast charger.It can charge upto 70% in approx 20/25 mins.
3. camera is good with features live focus and slow motion video.
4. Performance is also pretty good with snapdragon processor.

Cons:
1. There is no speaker in the phone.They put some new technology in which sound comes from entire screen.Lot of improvements required here. Voice quality is not at all clear.Sometimes I have to put the call on speaker to listen properly.

2. Battery backup is not good keeping in mind that its not amoled screen and doesn'thave latest snapdragon processor.

3. Sound quality as I mentioned above is not good.Videos,songs or call whatever. Headphone quality is also average.But anyway who gives free headphones now a days :)

Tbe audio thru type c Jack is  minusfor this product.  No adopter works with this  audio port.  Where as the converter works with other models having audio type port.  This is the great disadvantage of this fone.

For this you can go for some other better model.

The design is good .. No AMOLED screen for this price tag while M30 are having AMOLED displays..Unnecessary Battery drain(Screen on tym is very less) ... I was impressed with Ultra wide camera Lens ... I want this phone to have glass sandwiched Aluminum frame like A50 does as it has the similar price tag ... Performance is ok .. but the materials used concerns durability .. time tells how this mobile stands when it comes to performance and any software issues as samsung are known to take more time to release software updates ...

My s8's screen broke and I needed a new phone asap as I had important calls to deal with. I found out about this phone and for some reason wanted this one only, waited for it to come on sale and purchased it then. The delivery was on time and the phone was as beautiful as I had imagined. The screen is big and the front camera doesn't take up part on the screen, it's close to not being there, so the screen just brightens up more! The fingerprint reader is slow detecting a finger while installing a fingerprint, but reading is quite fast. The facial recognition is on point, don't even need to type in my password! The camera is great, but not as great I had expected, but for 20,000 it is great! I charge my phone overnight for 100% in the morning and head over to college by and come back by 6pm with 40% remaining, so the battery life is amazing! Overall I loved the phone.

I found the device absolutley value for money. I am really impressed with the display quality as I was a bit sceptical about it as it is not a amoled but a TFT panel. Also the performance is great as I am not experiencing any lag. Also I liked the camera quality but sometimes low light photos are a bit disappointing. Also the fingerprint scanner works pretty good as it sometimes has problem in recognizing. It works really well but I would have liked if it gave a haptic feedback while unlocking. Also I didn't find any issues with the battery life of the device even though it has comparatively lower battery capacity as compared to other competitors. It still gives a day of moderate usage. Also I am really impressed with its rate of charging.
Overall, I thoroughly liked the device.

Its osome phone in this price band. Fingerprint reader, face unlock is pretty good and fast enough.
Screen sound technology is also wonderful. Especially when you are sweating there is no chance of moisture going inside. 5star for that.
Battery life could be little more, but it's good for whole day work and watching videos.

Camera quality also good.

Use this phone for about a month best thing about it is the display, phone look (built quality) rear camera is really good, fingerprint reader, face detection is good, internal storage and ram is good but the concerns are battery  life for me an average user it last for full day but charging is really  fast.
Before buying this phone I was bit concerned about the on screen speaker during calls but it is average and tends to vibrate but if you are using full volume if you down the volume problem will be resolved. Lovely headphone and Dolby atmos sound treat to listen.

All in all I have been and will be the Samsung user and will never prefer Mi and realme..

In this price range best to buy this phone and seawater blue is the best choice according to me because of innovative color combination.

Good sleek design, size just perfect for holding in one hand, neither too large nor to small, great screen to phone ratio, good UI easy to use &amp; access apps, however  icons could have been slightly  smaller, screen sound tech is average but u need to get used to it &amp; identify the right spot to place your eardrum but large uninterrupted  screen compensates  for the average screen sound tech.
Sound quality is awesome with Dolby atmos feature for earphones, with a c type earphone Jack the sound is awesome treat for ears, the camera are good but the deal breaker is wide screen camera of this phone, the videos &amp; pics taken in wide screen mode are like very very good. Other than that for tik tik lover some gr8 effects are provided also with slow mo &amp; super slomo effects.
Fingerprint  touch sensor works perfectly fine, while face lock feature work good,  only off is that after it reads your face and unlocks the phone still have to slide it to actually  arrive at your home page, maybe with further updates it will get sorted. Battery life is one&amp; a half day with average usage no gaming.

Worst Camera  it's just like 15 MPXL..
Captured picture is just like apply a filter..
And size or photos is below 4MB ..
No background information showing in any photo clearly after very less zoom..

The best ever phone that one with a medium level budget can buy.
Samsung has come up with its exquisite expertise to deliver the best ever experience to its middle class buyers. Though a medium level class in price the phone has an ultra luxurious impact on for the customers. The new Samsung PLS tft display will give you an experience far better as that of super amoled. The Snapdragon processor has made the performance on to an extra magnificent level. The new game play mode will give an optimised playing experience. The sound quality in the Samsung is far beyond that cab be expressed. The triple camera setups will deliver the utmost catchy apperances on the image output. All together the best mid-range Samsung Smartphone.

I gifted the phone to my sister and she is too much happy with it ...
Pros is its good battery life, and its superb display with rapid fast finger print sensor and fabulous camera picture quality.
Just little improvement need in image stabilization and face recognition is little slower than other competitors in the segment.
One must consider this phone with budget of 15 to 20k.

The phone is the best that I've used till date. The fingerprint sensor is really quick and so is the face unlock. Camera being a great thing about it,the 32MP camera gives a very good view of the things,the ultrawide lens gives a view that is almost what the human eye is able to see. The SSD technology is another great feature of it. Five stars seem to be less for this marvelous piece.

Well , this is the first time I am using Samsung phone and honestly I waited for this phone due to its look and features. Overall it's a nice phone with no hang problem with many apps opens at one time so no issue with the performance. Camera is great but could have been better, wide camera is good. Front camera is giving decent results. Phone is smooth and face unlock and fingerprint unlock is fast. Battery is good and can last upto 16 to 18 hours as per your usage. Over all I can say it's a great buy at 20k range giving other options.

Two things could have been better battery and front camera.

I really like this phone.  The look and feel is great . I dont mind having one point  with the charger and the earpiece in one place . The problem here I have lost my ear piece.  And I bought several ear pieces with USC c type aswell as some ejecter ..but none of them works . Charging is working but when I try the other ear pieces but it not work.. at all
I'm sure not every earpiecs that I bought it's not defected .. so I'm sure there must be something wrong with the phone.

I'm guessing only the original sa.sung earpieces works
And I dont mind buying them at all but the problem is I'm not even getting the original piece online aswell

Not I'm stuck with this phone with no earpiece

I need help with this

The build and performance are decent. Some echo observed during calls. The lack of a 3.5 mm stereo Jack is an irritant if you want to connect your phone to other audio devices or other headphones.  The type C to Stero jack connectors in the market are not quite compatible for this device. Samsung should introduce adapters quickly.

There is lack in this phone . The camera is not upto the mark . It is 32 mp camera but its seems like only 12 mp camera. The Phone is very fast n has very large storage thats n attractive point but we can buy other phones with almost better or same features at a better price than this. We should go for poco F1 or Galaxy A50 insted of Galaxy M40.

So..I've been using this phone for a week now....and lemme tell u the phone is pretty good by looks but is slippery ...as it doesn't comes with amoled screen but still works good..and camera it up to the mark only in daylight it somehow struggles in night ...but still by managing few settings u can take a awesome click...the speaker sound is load....and snap675 is not compatible with asphalt it hangs a lot on default settings.. The inscreen speaker is good but when the other person speaks the whole phone gives a bit of vibration ...I don't know only I'm feeling that maybe..the punch whole design ..damn it looks soo good that's the only point you will think its worth money...the battery works for a day I don't think it's that bad..and fast charging works well ..its a good package in 20k go for it..you won't regret

I have purchased this product 6 months back and after 3 months of use battery life got very bad. It won't stays more than 3-4 hours after getting full charged. Talking about camera it's a fake one like if you are clicking a picture from front camera it will beutify you to another level. Back camera is good though. So according to my experience I won't suggest anyone to buy this phone. One more disappointment from this product as battery life is very bad amd you can't even connect charger and earphones at the same time as it is only having one plug point. Very much disappointed from samsung.  Didn't expected that from Samsung.

Performance is good
Display quality good
Build quality just about average
On screen sound below average
Battery below average ,I dont have any game on my phone , but then too I have to charge twice with full 100% to get away with battery
Camera also  below average
One main problem is  I have tried many usb type c  to 3.5mm headphone connector but none of them worked I dont know what's the issue but seriously it sucks

Many other good phones are available other than this , I dont recommend this phone to anyone please buy some other phone

Previously I gave a very good feedback on this phone.  This is my first non-chinese phone and thought Samsung will be good.  I am not a gamer.  I only use it for communications.  I see that this phone data gets disabled during voice call.  This really is causing serious problems in attending online meetings etc, while keeping the WiFi hotspot on.  Need a proper response from Samsung or its nothing but cheating all the customers.  Any one could see this problem when they talk through earphones, else will assume data is enabled.  My old Lenovo phone is fat better than this crap.

Simply the best ever at this price 17k! Samsung OS is smooth and cool unlike oppo and stuff, no unnecessary system apps to waste your storage, awesome battery backup and incredibly fast charging. Camera is upto mark as well. Display is just love!

Its been few days for using M40, hence sharing my experience,
Pros:-
Great picture clarity.
Touch works very smooth.
Finger print sensor and face recognition works faster.
Camera quality is excellent except ultra wide mode.
Very sleek design and light weight.

Cons:-
On screen voice for incoming call is not clear, whereas it works fine on HD calling.
Can't use headphone while charging as1 c type input available
Pictures are not that much clear on Ultra wide mode.
Battery  cap shd be more than 4000 MAH.

So, overall phones delivers exceptionally well in this range.

I am writing this review after using more than 2 months One of the worst phone I have , battery life is very poor it will be discharged clvery fastly not even one day for one full charge only for browsing less than 2 hours and no gaming and video plays. Camera quality is average. Wifi is very poor it's not showing/connecting router less than 30 meters one room away. I have oppo phone there IAM seeing signal strength of wifi is excellent and with same router M40 phone connects very few times that too with poor signal strength,I totally disappointed with the phone mainly with wifi connection and battery life

The phone has Type C charger, so you can't use headphones while charging, camera quality is worst, you can click photo of other objects clearly but for people,  its worst. Battery drains quickly.

Most important problem is, the screen lost its sensitivity,  if you r scrolling then it automatically clicks the things.

Is you r calling someone, it has sound from entire mobile, that irritates.

RAM is good, storage is good.

Please dont buy this mobile. Honestly not worth 20K.
The basic function of call is not met. The screen speaker is not clear and vibrates. Leave in a crowded place, even in a calm clear room, you have to extra vigilant to hear the other speaker.Camera is pathetic no auto-focus and even subject with focus looks blurred.

I switched to Samsung from Chinese manufacturers recently and bought M40 and i had to say ...what an amazing device it is. Especially the performance.SD 675 and 6gb Ram is a god combination.The display is not comparable with an Amoled but it's the best non Amoled display in the market.The fingerprint sensor is accurate and fast (could be a little bit faster).
Now coming to the camera..I found the stock camera a little disappointing but when i downloaded the GCAM...the pictures were fricking beautiful...the Wide angle camera on the stock is the best tho.
Battery may disappoint some people but the SD675 is an efficient process and can give you a day long battery life easily.
Its a really amazing device.

I am using this phone from last 10 days there is no issue with performance and the camera quality is excellent. No issue with security, fingerprints scanner and face reading is so accurate in this device. Battery performance is also good eventhough the battery capacity is 3500mah, due to its processor which optimizes the battery consumption. The only thing I am missing in this phone is 3.5 mm headphone Jack, because I have JBL earphones of 3.5 mm jack which I am unable to use them now. And also Samsung have not provided back cover in box for safety and back covers are not available in local markets also still I am using phone without back cover. Overall the phone is good value for money Samsung did good job this time i really impressed with it.

This has a problem in internal working because in lock screen mode, it lags when we change the wallpapers and when we open the settings at that time on screen display automatic click inside screen happens and other thing is that when we want to edit pictures from albums, photos doesn't edit. It is a very big disadvantage in this phone and there is a one more problem that in the dark whenever I use the phone the two problems happen- the first one is the circle camera light appears on above camera and the second problem is the display brightness on the lock screen wallpaper is not working properly.

I purchased this phone as a gift for my dad trusting amazon and Samsung.
Overall the phone looks good but when a person calls you the output of voice is very disappointing and also the phone gets heated up very quickly.
Also the battery life of the phone is very bad I look for a quick solution to the problem
Hoping amazon and Samsung solve the problem at the earliest

Overall performance of the phone is impressive. It's quite fast and responsive. Sleek design and o infinity display add more desirability and excellence to the phone. Highlighting the positive points, Camera works amazing in both rear and primary, Fast Charging going fine, speaker and Type c earphones are premium in quality terms. But comparing the phone with other samaung mid range phones it lacks samsung knox secure features where no option is available to the users for masking apps and or secure their contents in secure folders. Samsung pay option is also missing in the phone. Rest, phone is attractive, feels premium, No heating issues while using or on charging.Except 2-3 down points mentioned above phone is stellar and worth buying.

worse phone,  don't waste money in this. camera quality is also bad and doesn't support any connector, so you can't use any connector to use both charger and headphone.
Accessories:-
Headphones stopped working it's just 5 month.

Overall not satisfied with the phone quality.

1. Excellent phone with great design and premium looks
2. seawater blue design is awesome and shines better than glass in sunlight
3. Camera is ok for a 20 k phone and 6 + 128 gb variant
4. Smooth and fluid using experience
5. Very light weight and lot less slippery than glass back mobiles
6. Battery is good as claimed 3500 MAH but lacks headphone jack port
7. Good gaming experience but due to absence of 3.5 mm jack charging+playing not available
8. Samsung one UI is great and clean
9. Camera does not have night mode but I think Samsung will update it later on
10. Little bit costlier but it is Samsung
WANT TO GIVE IT 4 AND 1/2 BUT AMAZON ONLY PROVIDES 4 OR 5
SO I GIVE 5🤗

Very Good phone in this price range.
Lot Happy with phones performance so far
Camera quality is highlight of this phone, it clicks great picture even in low light
Face unlock works faster than i could have imagined
Good display quality (As i watch lots of web series on my phone so liked it more)
On my personal view it would have been great if fingerprint reader were on front side (although on back side is not an issue)
Battery life is is just good as it is just 3500 mAh, could have been better phone with 4000-5000 mAh, as in this age were people spend most of their time on phone so this could have given us extra few hours before we plug in charger.
HAPPY WITH OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF SAMSUNG M40

Dear Amazon Team,

I bought this phone for one of my friend lives in UAE as a gift and i realize when he tried to use it in UAE that this is only work in INDIA.There was no information at the site when i was buying it. And it is a common understanding that a phone will work anywhere in the world and the Phone is now in UAE can't be used.

My Question Is why it was not mentioned at the product description at your website?
and What is the solution here now?

It was a gift and i have no words now to the person whom i gifted.

Regards
Sonam

The phone has an excellent design and build. It feels very good to hold and use. The seawater color was way beyond my expectations. It is simply beautiful.
The phone is snappy and smooth but I need time to get used to the One UI after using stock android.
The camera is just average. The back camera is slow and the front camera beautifies the photo automatically, which I did not like.
The most disappointing aspect of the phone is its battery. With 3500 mAh, the phone gets past for only 1 day, my usage being very light as its my secondary phone. Its battery maybe compared with my iPhone 7!!!

Pros:
1. Very good performance.
2. Excellent multi tasking.

Cons:
1. Very bad camera. Improved a bit with the latest update, but still not up to the mark as it was expected from Samsung.
2. Battery life is very poor. Struggles to survive a day. On video call battery drains very very fast.
3. While using the phone on charge touch becomes unresponsive sometimes. And same happens without charge also.
4. Finger print and rear camera region becomes super hot after continuous usage for 1 hour.

So I will consider this as waste of money.

My honest answer phone is actually good lots of people complaining and all but I'm compare this phone like redmi, realme. This phone display actually good as compared to other you never tell this is TFT display. To much closer to LED display.Overall phone is actually good like camera and all. In display sound is really doing job great but it's depend person by person. If you looking 20k phone this is good choice but it's also depend person by person  actual Samsung os is really good

The most horrible product from Samsung.
Worst camera
Poor battery life.
Poor build quality.
And TFT screen is also very bad.
The audio quality for handset and earpiece is  very poor.
And the Amazon support, you will never gonna get any soulation from them.

I got the phone with defective screen. But they not going to listen.

Samsung M40 is a very good phone to buy at Rs 20000 Price point. The Finger print Reader is located at the back and is very fast. I have used this securely with all banking applications to. The Camera is Good. Though I need to try it out extensively. I use this phone for all day to day transactions and along with mobile MS office is an extension to my PC. I use the free Sophos App for further securing the Phone. All in all Samsung M40 is a great phone

A good one... my last phone was a9 pro2016.. i liked it very much it ws sturdy and all, this is also good with new features, in display i wish there was warmer hue in this phone, like in a9pro which is very comfy fr eyes, even nw i feel a9 gives more premium feel compared to this, time will tell me more abt it.. i wish battery was 4000 mah but good enough fr this price(fast charger is a plus ) type c cable for earphones is okay with me, i hope its available in stores.(not that i knw) nevertheless storage is a plus and new phone is always new phone.

I have been using this phone for over 15 days and I'm absolutely satisfied with this product
Here are some pros and cons according to me
Pros:-
1. infinity O display at this price range
2. Snapdragon 675 processor is so fast and I'm not facing any lagging problem.
3. Triple camera picture quality is so good comes with 4k recording and front camera is superb
4. Latest screen sound technology and it is so clear
5. Comes with type-c fast charging port
6. It has FHD+ display which has excellent display quality can't find difference with super-amoled

Cons:-
1. It does not have headphone jack.
2. It comes with 3500mah which is average.

Camera- Both the cameras are very poor quality.
Call voice - Not really good. You can't really hear the voice clearly.
Design and Display- Its just fine. Not great though for a 20k phone.
In all, Its not worth half the price of it. I won't recommend it to anyone.

Very bad product.
Motherboard failed within 5 months of usage
Phone gets heated up quick and battery doesn't last half a day. Headphones and charging point in a single port is a huge drawback cuz headphones don't work all the time.
When I visited a Samsung service centre the place was filled with so many customers with similar issues in the M series range
Don't go for Samsung's middle range/budget phones.
Simply waste of money.

Bought this product with so much enthusiasm, but very disappointed with the performance.
1. The new technology of having the earpiece on the display of the phone does not work for me. I'm not able to hear anything during calls. This is very frustrating &amp; irritating. I have to say "pardon me" a 1000 times to every caller that call me or whom I call. Very bad!
2. The battery life is pathetic. It drains like a broken mud vessel. Just cannot accept a battery like this.

I bought Samsung M40 before a week and it has speaker problem. So I placed a order to replacement. The Amazon technician came to checked phone and he said Samsung M40 phone itself has a speaker problem so if you replace it the another phone will also have same problem. So this not a problem, all Samsung M40 have same issue and he sent feedback as phone don't have any problem. And denied my replacement order.

So people who want to buy this phone please change your mind.

Very disappointing from Samsung mobile.

Price wise what you are getting is good. If you are not a camera lover then you can buy galaxy m30 with a battery of 5000mah. There is software flaw in this phone. I replaced the first one and the problem is same in this one also. Some apps don't open from notification panel like daily hunt which is preinstalled,  Facebook,  maps. Either the app crashes or screen is just white. Not a major issue but I am not able to decide whether I keep the phone or return it again. Other wise the touch, finger sensor, camera, screen everything is great.

Overall great package,  except the speaker quality. Note the speaker for playing media has good quality sound problem is with the speaker to make calls. Since the call speaker is tucked under the display,  the voice quality is compromised.  I mean you can hear the sound but the volume is quite low, may be because of the screen guard that we stick onto the screen. But it's not comparable to even any basic feature phone.

For those who need to make lot of calls and that too from outdoor, it's a strict no no phone. Otherwise a great all rounder phone.

I think this is the best samsung smart phone in this price range. It has got some  new technologies like screen sound casting and hole punch camera.with the triple rear camera (32mp main) it shots good pictures, it also has many good camera features lije qide angle, bokeh, night mode, etc. Display was awesome as it has super Amoled display. Coming to the performance, the pwrformance of this phone is quite good, it has snapdragon 636 processor and andreo 6l2 Gpu. Battery is the main drawback of this mobile. With all the new high end specifications the battery which was given is not sufficient, atleast more than 4000 mah battery is suggested

Eye catching  design from display side, particularly  with camera embedded in screen itself, it looks good. Battery life is good and charging  speed is preety fast. I think it's good phone in less than 20k price.

Cons: while charging or while using earphone phone get bit slow.
Single Jack for both charging and earphone, and charging port type is not of common  design.

Had a lot of expectation after buying this phone. First off the audio of phone calls, it's just terrible! Really bad mic and even in a quiet room, it's a struggle to hear the other person's voice. The volume is insufficient and the sound that comes out has lots of issues.

Next up is the 32mp camera. Huge disappointment as images are not clear and image size does not match up the claim of 32mp. Battery life has been satisfactory. If you are OK with these issues and are ready to fork out more than 20K for this phone, I wish you good luck!

Finally I think Samsung got their mid segment phone combination right. Though you miss amoled display however punch hole display works just fine.  Working smooth with decent battery life. If it's within your budget go for it instead of cheap Chinese products.

Screen on this phone is huge. Great picture quality and great camera shutter speed for fast photography.  I love the front camera placement. It does not block view while watching in full screen. Fingerprint scanner is also great feature, but I have stopped using it because my finger naturally rest on the scanner and I open my phone unknowingly, which was a bit irritating, although my father loves this feature in his phone

I found good phone. Overall quality is great. Battery life with in 20 minutes enough to charge it full capacity. And RAM speed is quite very well.. I know Samsung brand is always unique. I know Samsung can manufactur more upgraded phones. I never miss out for new product of Samsung.. I love to have and even in full screen it is good to study in large wide screen and movie quality is also great seen in M40.I don't use finger print because I feel it can't safe.. But technology is moving so I feel good go and use of sensors is different level of opening. Thank you Samsung.

Although there is no 3.5mm headphone jack but the type c earphones provided in the box are just lit. Battery, though 3500 mah but if you limit the background process of google you will not need to recharge it untill 12 hours. Display is not super amoled but the color and contrast is very good. It's display is very crisp. And moreover it has nfc which is a life savior when it comes to transfer photos from camera to phone. If fingerprint reader is not coverd properly it doesn't say no match, it rather commands to cover it properly. It also works if your hands are sweaty. If you need this for gaming this thing is an absolute beast!!

Good one, good packaging, delivered in a day,... evrythings looks fine. But the smartphone do not have earpiece ..... the sound is not clear at all... you need to put on the headphone if the person on the other side is talking in low voice. This is not expected ... from a brand like Samsung.. to develop a phone whose main purpose is calling... and the phone fails in this.

Dislike : 1. Battery life - should be better considering the current uses of mobile (Audio, video, game, social media, learning apps). Even M30 has 5000 mah battery.
2. Incoming call quality - the unique feature of this model is very disappointing. Not able to hear the voice clearly.

Repenting that i have selected one of the worst product ever.Sound system is horrible and the audio jack which come with usb is very loose.Anytime we watch video the audio gets muted automatically and we need to pull out the cable and again keep it and it happens back and forth like that.Also the speaker quality is horrible such that if we receive any calls the audio was so vibrant near the users ear which they claim it as on screen speaker feature for this model.
Not at all happy....Neither able to enjoy with videos nor the audio...

Camera quality is ok. But display is LCD not AMOLED  Even the cheaper models of Samsung comes with AMOLED Display
Glossy look is not much impressive. Looks like Chinese phone. Available in two colors only. Not much color option.Speed is good

Just discussing some of the cons of the phone -
1. Very poor battery life. Runs for just 12 hours on full charge and moderate usage
2. No 3.5 mm jack, earphones are provided, but becomes a problem if you forget to carry them or if you have to use aux
3. LCD screen. Not best of the display
Rest all is superb

I am not suggesting to buy this product. The strong reason was the hearing speaker implementation. They say it is a innovation, but for me it was a pathetic experience. The Voice was coming with vibration because of this technology. It was really annoying to me whenever I received call. Most frequent usage was call only. If that itself irritating then no use of spending that much money to buy this kind of worst product. Another thing is no privacy while speaking with your recipient. Any one can hear the person Voice from any direction.

Performance is good .
Battery could be better because 4000 mah batteries are quite common.
Camera despite being 32 megapixels is very bpoor.(wanted to use a really bad word instsad of 'poor')
Slightly overpriced
The display-speakee feature could be sacrificed for aal the basic requirements above
Samsung should know that their customers have to give up many important features for very few edgy functions in this phone.
I WOULD SAY IMPROVE THE DESIGN

I have been using M40 for 2 weeks. The performance has been excellent. The Display is bright and Vivid giving good quality video. The Camera performance is also good but not the Best. The battery is OK for a Days to use. Do not expect anything more than that. Build quality is also good. The display is the main attraction of the phone with a small notch for a front camera at the up corner of the Display. The processor is quick and fast.. I have not experienced any heating issues with the phone. I  am using NOKIA 8.1 also. But I will give one star up for NOKIAs camera and HD Display. But at this price range Samsung does a good Job.

The 2Ghz octa-core Snapdragon 675 processor coupled with 6GB of RAM is enough to make sure the Galaxy M40 runs smoothly for most day-to-day tasks. It is a reliable processor as we have seen it work effortlessly with the Redmi Note 7 Pro as well. Out of the box, the Galaxy M40 feels quite snappy as one would expect

This mobile is one of the worst product I have ever purchased within a month it's speaker is not working properly. I went to the customer service center they told me take backup of data we have to format it. How could expect that just now you have purchased one mobile you have collected most important data now once again you to restore it one time. So inspite of repairing my mobile now I am looking for exchanging this one. What is the use of this mobile if it can not perform properly even for 2 month and you have to visit to the service center. Very worst product this is please don't buy...

Firstly, the design of the phone is great.I really like the punch hole design and the back panel looks good too. Secondly,the cameras are decent, captures good photos , have good dynamic range but software optimization is not that great. Coming to the performance of the phone, the phone can easily handle heavy games and applications, and does not have any heating issues. Lastly, the battery life ain't bad and easily last me a full day but it might be less for a Heavy user.

Overall, the phone is good for this price range.

Awesome phone, this is my first android phone. I have been avoiding android phones for these many years. But the pin hole camera, the seawater blue coloured with glossy finish triggered me too but this phone . But I will never regret buying it. The smart features provided by Samsung takes this phone one step higher. Cameras looks perfect and the processing speed is very good without and lag. On a whole this is definitely a Millenial package

I am not convinced with amazon replacement policy and their application to check camera quality
According to them customer wrong about camera and their application right...wooowwww

The phone looks good. Camera average. Yes at this price range Samsung should have provided AMOLED display.
The speaker under the display technology, I really don't know how much successful it is. Had hearing issues during call with the initial handset and also the replaced handset. The caller is also unable to hear my voice during call and this happened with the replaced handset as well. Somewhere in the reviews its written that the technician will come and check on the issue and yes i agree to it that this is really frustrating. A customer wont be returning a product for the 2nd time without it being a genuine problem. Was totally unexpected from Samsung. Amazon is co-operative and I hope i get replacement again for this defective handset.

It has Good display , sharp amd good color balance , has Fast charging and no overheating .Camera is good in bright light. Looks great. But has short battery life inspite of 3500mah. Onscreen
N speaker is not very clear. And has c- type earphone Jack which is a lil drawback.

1. Short battery life
2. No amoled
3. Carrier aggregation is limited to 2CA i.e. 2x2 MIMO(should have been 3CA at this price but its Samsung)
4. On screen speaker is not good. Voices are getting muffled
5. Glitches heard while listening to music using type c earphones as soon as i touch the onscreen home button

It is the worst phone i have even seen in my life..
1. the speaker dosen't  work always.. need t I'll restart the phone to make it work.
2. Not able to hear an ur sound after using the headphone.
3. Bettery life is not good.
4. Phone gets hanged  frequently showing the  message "UI not responding"

#amazonindia metioned there was a return policy but when i called them and informed them about the problem, they said they won't replace the phone.  I requested them few times but nothing happened.

Things I liked the most ÷
1.the punch hole display it's just innovative and sometimes people confuse it with samsung galaxy s10 E so you can show off
2. Performance is great Snapdragon chipset gave it invincible speed
3.Camera quality is also great and wide angle is really wide
4.when you turn on the flash the borders kind of emits light which is kind of innovative

Things I didn't like
1.it doesn't have secondary screen like samsung galaxy A50 which my friend have it gives the phone the premium look

This is my honest review from my point of view.. hope you like it

No good. Stick with Redmi for budget phones .. Samsung doesn't know the fine art of making a feature rich budget phone .. which is logical because that is going to eat into their prime market.. but for Redmi, budget phones are their bread and butter.. camera is bad, bad battery life .. OS is not user friendly.. very limited options ..

Using the mobile since last 4 months. Mobile speaker on phone quality is not good at all. Unable to hear caller voice clearly. Camera is not up to the mark. It's just average, I can not say good and was not expected this type of camera quality from Samsung. Slow motion and super slomotion mode is completely useless. you can record only 3-4 sec. only in this mode. Body is made of good quality plastic. Screen would be gorilla glass but it's not.

Ordered this phone as a gift, Video calls works fine and Audio Calls - was not able to listen to the other person. Tried trouble shooting many times and still was not able to get it done.
 Tried returning it and customer service representative says that he would send over a technician and get it resolved.. Now why would I want a gift to be repaired and .. Why don't I have an option to return this faulty device...  Very Upset with the service and product and never buying this one again or opting any service from .in.

So far, it's amazing experience, truly OMG..  only concern is in respect with battery life, it's barely making whole day with moderate use .  Hope amazon will give more options  when it come to accessories

Pros.
Amazing headphones  good sound
Good screen  infinity o display is amazing
Face recognition  and finger reader ia good a d responsive  .
Value for money
Good gaming performance.

A really good phone for the price it's available at.
Camera is pretty good and the clarity is much better than my previous phone's (Lenovo K5 Note).
The screen size is quiet big which is good for watching movies/shows etc.
Storage is also really good at 128gb. I've always had an issue with this and had to always extend using a micro SD card. Not anymore..
CPU speed is pretty good. So far I haven't encountered  any lags or hanging.
I got it for a great deal at 13.5k with exchange so very happy with my phone overall.

Totally unhappy with the battery life though it survives the entire day without much scare but heavy users need to stay away from this phone.
The sound during calls is not at all clear and quite uncomfortable probably due to on-screen sound feature
Doesn't have a notification led nor samsung pay.
Also the 3.5mm headphone jack is missing and so is the connector.
Many features missing for the price
M30 or a50 can be a better choice tahn this.

This is very good phone. I did not find any big difference in its display though it has TFT screen. Camera quality is good. Touch is smooth and crisp.
The only concern is for battery life. Samsung needs to  work on it a bit more. I will give 4 star 🌟 out of

After using it for around 3 weeks. The battery thing is irritating me more n more. Even if you don't use it much the battery drain like anything. I would have not buy this phone if I had any clue about its battery performance.

If u want a good camera, good network reception and a good battery life, pls don't waste ur money. The camera is pathetic when compares to galaxy a50,  nokia 8.1 and even 7+. the facial recognition fails on several occassions. The hard part is cudn't return it back to amazon as the app they ask to intall shows everything ok!!!

Pros :
Supports high end games.
Rear camera is good
Battery life is good when you don't use for gaming for much
Cons:-
Battery life was little less than expected , drains fast when you play  PUBG like games.
Front camera is  not good in low light
Screen touch sensitivity is little less when compare to high end mobile.
Mobile gets heat when you play high end games

Overall very good at this price range for whom want to experience the high end games now and then but not to often. Rest other futures are good for office going people.

Smooth and speed with some of the pre-installed Samsung apps. Disabled those after that mobile is very fast. Clarity and design are top notch. Speaker volume is a bit different as it uses the new screen vibrating tech. Takes a while to get used to it.

I was brought this phone in 15 July 2019.
After using 2 or 3 day's we realized that could purchase wrong phone.
M40 raking not so good compare with m30.
Voice call in open area can't listen clearly.
Camera megapixels are 32 but can not equal to 12 or 16 megapixel.
Night vision technology are also not for valuable.
Screen voice technology are also failed with voice call.
Front camera clicking  on bad pictures.

Built quality is good so is the camera and the fingerprint scanner but the thing that bothered me the most is the placement of the speaker grill for calls which instead of the top corner is located way far from the centre near the right top corner. Now I do not know that is it the placement of those or something else but WHENEVER YOU TALK TO SOMEONE THE SOUND ECHOS MAKING A COMPLETE MOCKERY OF THE PHONE. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE A HEAVY CALLING PERSON!!!!!!!!

Actually this phone is a complete package by Samsung except few things like battery, headphone Jack only.
Pros:
1) fingerprint reader is fast
2) camera quality is good
3) punch hole display is awesome in this price range by Samsung
4) 6 GB ram and 128 GB storage is so good
5) snapdragon 675 is more powerful
6) screen sound technology is awesome
Cons:
1) 3500mah battery is little less
2) no headphone Jack
3) TFT display but if we compare amoled and TFT display side by side then only we can see the difference between both display.

If you want to have a feel of a branded phone in budget then u can go for it since the punch hole camera leaves people guessing that it is high end flagship phone. The other qualities are so so. The screen is tft so dont expect a great viewing experience although u will not be able to say whether it is tft or not until u compare the viewing experience with other smartphones which have amoled screens. If u like the design then go for it ptherwise nothing very special about it

Camera quality is very good and slow motion, ultra slow motion  are top notch. Battery life is good as it is a 3500mAh, works fine for a complete day of usage of internet, videos. If games like PUBG are played it stays for 3-4 hours.
Perfect phone for 20000/- from Samsung with 6GB Ram and 128GB memory. I guess this is the first phone from Samsung with so many features in such affordable price and that is one of the reason we brought it immediately on the day of Amazon sale.

1. The screen is pretty good and you also get a punch hole camera in this budget which is unbelievable.
2. The 32mp rear camera is performing very good and also get that wide angle camera which is killer 🔥🔥🔥🔥
3. The battery life is good but it would be bettter if they have given the 5000 mAh as on other M series smartphone.
4. Over all the phone is very powerful
5. If you are looking for a stylist branded phone with all the lastest hardware then go for it

Great device. You get a premium looking handset which is very handy and light at the same time. 6GB Ram and 128 GB space is cool. You get only 3 color options. Blue is my personal favourite.
I have been using this device for more than a week now and quite happy with it.
It would be a five star for M40 if it had a better battery life. Overall good.

The phone runs flawlessly....some of the functions like screen sound, Dolby Atmos, night mode and picture in picture function stands out.
Face recognition runs perfectly.... picture and sound quality is awesome.
Battery is 3500mah, which I felt was a bit less...but fast charging makes it even .
Camera quality is above avg...auto focus takes a little time.
Fingerprint sensor is also good.
Infinity'O'display is just beautiful.
Total value for money.

This phone I have received with high expectations but it has disappointed me to the extreme . New phone Hangs frequently within 1 week of app installation and the return and exchange policy for amazon is very bad in this case . It would take some time to get the phone ready for use and understand all the features so 10 days is very less . I am not at all satisfied with this product . I need my money back if amazon values its prime customers .

Writing this review after using it for more than a week.
Pros
Display,

Fingerprint unlock is faster,
Punch Hole Camera,
Sleek design and Low weight

Cons
Battery could have been given more capacity like 4000mah or 4500mah.
Screen Sound Technology. If you keep full volume while calling, you can fell vibration in front and back side of mobile.
Type C port for both charging and earphones. Cannot use both at same time.

Phone stopped stopped charging after 7 months use. The message was temperature too low for charging.  I took it to the service center. He claimed that it has been tampered.  That too inside the mobile.  So wondering whether genuine new mobiles are sold or we are getting defective pieces at discount.

It has been a month that i purchase this phone and it hangs so so much that you cant even open it or do anything for a 4 to 5 mins. It has such a worst speaker. You can't hear anything properly. Speaker vibrates so much when the other person speaks. Screen gets automatically locked when a call is received i again have to enter the paswrds and open it. Worst performance. I regret buying it. Even after the complain the amazon was not hear for the exchange of product. Do not buy this please.

Infinity O display is amazing.
It is Widevine L1 certified, can watch Full HD Netflix and Prime.
Battery is decent, works for a full day with moderate use. Can extend it to day and a half with minimal usage.
Coming from a stock Android experience, One UI is decent and looks good.
Fast Charging with this phone is good. Other reviews seem to exaggerate the heat while charging, it does heat up like any other devices with fast charging.

Cons:
No AMOLED, M30 at a similar price point has one.
Battery could have been 4000 mAh

I bought this Samsung M40 last Friday (05.07.2019) and am extremely disappointed with the battery and performance.
The battery life is extremely worse and totally very disappointment.
The camera performance awesome.
Its does have screenshot menu and Samsung mobile Always on Display is missing
In market below 15k mobiles have good battery, camera and best performance too.
But this M40 totally disappointed/upset me as I am a phone addict
This mobile Rs.20000/- is not value for money its just waste of money

Screen touch and resolution very good. Camera quality and flash super, even in low light nice pics. Performance good.
Back body is made up of plastic look wise appear premium but after 5 days only scratches are appearing in margins of the phone. No blink light for notification  very disappointing.... Screen speaker concept is good but the received sound quality is not very fine and original. Battery life is so so just average. Face detection and finger print work nicely...

I purchased m40 one and half months ago. From beginning it is not working properly.Some issues are like heating, Battery back not good,  Screen is LCD, not good as compare to Amoled, and one feature screen sound is the worst feature as I feel. Right now my mobile is in service centre because earphones are not working. So I can say Samsung fully looted with this product. Please don't buy this product. Thank you.

Overall a nice phone. Except the camera is not that sharp interms of focus, picture sharpness, overall picture quality, etc. Samsung camera doesnot match to the clarity n sharpness of Carl Zeiss lens found on ANY Nokia devices. Pictures captured on Nokia devices r crisp, sharp even when zoomed to max.
Also there is no zoom option when photos or videos r captured in wide angle mode. If u cant zoom than what is the point of having a wide angle lens(in back or front camera).

Hi all,

Please don't buy...for 6 months it's worked fine later I face two issues.
1. Call not getting connect at first time. If I try second time then  call getting connected.
2. If I press the swipe button to pick the call, its getting disconnected..

I tried all options like reset the phone, software upgrade and changed the OLD SIM but no luck...

My friend bought the same model, he also face same issues..

Thanks,

Excellent gadget to own. Amazingly quick delivery next morning after placing the order. Great looks, clear sound quality.
One problem though, the charging chord fit into the instrument is loose. Unless you carefully check repeatedly the fast charging may not happen at all.

The battery doesn't charge fast if the mobile is connected to wifi or if the mobile data is turned on.
The mobile hangs if you play premium games, the camera is worst and doesn't capture a good picture,while clicking the picture it ll focus chages and the picture is blurry, even if you hold the mobile in the gimbal. Not worth for the money. Instead of purchasing this mobile,you can go for Nokia on the same segment as they have better processor.

Been using the phone for 3 days now and this is the basic idea I have about it.
1. Camera with Gcam does wonders.
2. Really smooth and the 6GB RAM with SD675 ensure a smooth experience.
3. It takes time getting used to sound on screen technology, though it could be better.
4. The speakers sound nice.
5. Battery life is as expected and with moderate use, it lasts a day.
OVERALL I'D SUGGEST THIS PHONE TO PEOPLE WHO WANT PERFORMANCE WITH A BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY

It's so fast Phone. I like fingerprint reader also when I tap on it it's gets opened in just a second I like it's camera quality also it's so awesome cam but I was in need of gorilla glass so this not in it so I can't let it drop from my hands  but I like battery life also it's so powerful when I were playing games on it, it's gaming time was awesome. It's provides so clear and smooth gaming.  I like it too much. So it's a awesome mid-range phone

Got this phone on first day sale out with lot of expectation..
Worst speaker technology voice was not clear, heating up so fast, for continously using battery will not support..
Poor camera quality..
Sometimes screen touch not functioning, finger print at back side is average..
Pros: slim look, core processor speed as a new phone..
Cons:
Many
Camera, speaker, head phone, compatibility.. Etc
Think twice before going to this phone..

Nice looking phone
Some problems are there
- flickering slow motion videos.
- camera can not handle movement (even slight movement give blurry photos)
- right/left sliding while charging is not smooth.
- only works with Indian SIM cards.
- short charging cable.
- dose not support Samsung Pay.
- fingerprint is ok but not as good as the galaxy S series.
- battery doesn't lasts one day with my regular use.

The Galaxy M40 feels like it's trying to cater to all audiences, and while it is definitely a segment disruptor, it falls a bit short of being the undisputed leader that it could have been. With that said, it's still a solid overall performer, and the most polished M-series offering by Samsung till date.
It has a hole-punch display and Screen Sound tech for voice calls
Apps runs smoothly, battery life is good, but the cameras are average. But you can’t expect everything in this price range. Keep it up, Samsung. Keep Going!

Right now I have some query about my recent order , as per  Samsung M 40 ,
the mobile come along with 15v fast charger but when I checked with charger
details it's shows only 5v.  Today I check with Samsung till free no
regarding this and my handset also get hot when this is only 2 days old.

I will give full review and update once corrdinate with Samsung till free
no or local authrise dealer.

This phone  does not have good speaker and sound is always blurred. You do not hear clearly what the other person is saying. I would not recommend to buy this model. Even the headphones were not working. I had to visit Samsung Service Centre to get the issue fixed. They had to fix some software issues also in the phone.
Overall, very bad experience and I am stuck with it since the return window is closed by the time I started using it.

Was expecting something as per said in advertisement.
Camera quality is worst in ever my life.
Seems it's not from Samsung... Samsung disappointed me... As I'm samsung phone user since I'm using mobiles.

Worst camera ever. If anyone going for camera... Just do not buy it.

Now even battery started draining.... 3 to 5 hrs r enough in ideal condition to discharge totally

Overall Phone is good but its battery and camera is not as good as other mobile brands in this range. Battery is drainig very fast, automatic brightness is working very slowly and front camera quality is also not good and there is also some bugs in proximity sensor. Its request to samsung that please fix all these issues as soon as possible. Mobile is all good, can be purchase by believing on samsung, that they will fix all these  issues in its further updates. These are all that i know about the phone after using it for 7 days.

This tool is going to work very fast and smoothly.
The quality of the screen is very beautifully and glow
But due to downloading a mobile Internet and 3 to 4 hours a problem, the phone continues to heat up
So just close this phone and 15 to 20 minutes
Now switch to the phone.

Fingerprint reader - needs improvement.
Camera - Biggest drawback is front camera not giving original pictures even in sunny day lights.
Battery life is good as per capacity of battery mentioned by Samsung.

Buttery MAH to be improved, front camera quality noy good as My last experiance Glaxy J5. Display should not be compromise as all series. If you have given 32 MP camera the you shoul provide Super amoled display.

If Battery and Display should be improved quality wise then this phone will be Good one. As my last experience  was really amazing and fully satisfied with galaxy J5 but i have purchased M40 but we have found some problems 1- Display quality, 2- Battery, Front flash with front camera quality.

So worth the price. The camera quality, finger print scanner are quite good for the price. The battery life idle pretty okay.
Love the display. The functions of the phone are pretty fast too. It is slim and quite easy to hold n use. Seems a little on the delicate side. One thing I like about samsung phones being they usually have no issues or glitches at least for 3 or 4 years. This is one main reason I prefer Samsung over any other brands.

phones are to communicate and this phone makes listening to voice difficult. I struggle every time I receive a call. Phone has speaker under the screen and not at the top. Everytime I need to adjust my ear up and down to find the right locatiion of speaker. I wanted to return it on the last day but I had only 30 mins to decide for replacement. There was no option to return it without exchange so unfortunately I am still using this phone.

Best phone , best in class , best for photography, the processor is  awesome  it can handle all heavy games , dolby atmos increases the quality of music or movie , moreover it also has widevine l1 certification for streaming movies and shows from amazon prime or Netflix  at fhd quality  moreover punch hole display  makes it look more premium , Only one bad thing is that battery is only 3100 mah but device  lasts for 7-8 hours

Camera is not very good, specially the front camera. Although you get wide angle for the rear camera, it is not up to the mark. Fingerprint is very slow. Battery is kind of okay. Otherwise a great package. In this price range with the brand of Samsung, you simply can't get wrong.

It's been 6 months using M40 and I have observed quite few regular issues. 1. Some times drop down does not work where all the basic icons are available. 2. Some times I have to restart the phone so that it can detect the sim. 3. Sound quality at the time of calling is really low, you need to be focused every time when you are on call otherwise it will not be audible. 4. After exact 6 months my earphone stopped working.
I won't suggest to buy to anyone

I purchased M40 mobile  for my mother but
I received  defective products.
Sim tray is not working.
Still she has no mobile for communication
Amazon customer care is telling. They will provide another mobile after checking.
For this process it will take time.😡🤬🤬

Poor power back up. Can't rely on this phone for 12 hours, without carrying a power bank.
Phone heats up badly, that you feel the heat  on your ear even after disconnecting call.
At times,no proper call connectivity. Initially, I thought its my service provider issue. But no. This phone doesn't provide proper connectivity.  Cant trust it at the time of emergency.
Camera is not as good as they show.

i liked the overall product , nice phone with samsung branding
except i will recommend uh to buy a back case as i got scraches the first day that too just keeping it in pocket
earphones are average, the battery seems to run a whole day but i dont know if that is gonna be good in long run
otherwise great display and other features are just awesome
 sound quality for call is just great

Very worst mobile.Following are the reasons for telling this product is worst:
1.Charging will get over easily even we don't use mobile that.
2.Over heating while mobile in charging,call or surfing internet
3.Volume buttons will work automatically  while using mobile.
4.Without hands free nothing was audible for watching a video
5.speakers are not working properly over call
Looking wose only mobile is good, features are worst

Update 2: Android auto doesn't work after Android 10 upgrade. My suffering after buying this phone is endless

Update: After Android 10 upgrade, when you take videos, the video and voice are not in sync. How can Samsung release upgrades with obvious errors like this. Samsung sucks to the core.
Worst camera.

Battery drains out in around 48hours ..  on normal usage, without any heavy game usage such as pubg.
Ram at any instance is free around 2 gb, even when you have closed all running apps, and restarted device. We get around 100gb free out of 128.

Biometrics work good.

Face detection works even when helmet is put on. Fingerprint sensors work good.

Ambient sensors are very adaptive.

Very smooth device.  Camera is just loveable.

Overall performance is nice but only the problem is with the touch sensitivity because screen responds when it touches with earphone wire , clothes etc. I recommend at least they should provide a good quality screen guard in the box as well. And while calling it sounds like call has connected and you can here ringing sound but that's not a actual call and i need to disconnect it and call again. but that is Rest everything is perfectly fine. I hope I will get supported app like G cam , samsung pay and other app soon.

Disappointed with this phone. As there is no earpiece, voice is not clear which comes from the screen. While in indoor, voice is somewhat audible but it's very difficult to understand the voice outdoor.

The phone is very handy, but the build quality is not good. Water vapours are trapped inside camera and display during rainy season,even you are in a dry place.
The display got damaged due to this issue..
This was the 1st time when I went for SAMSUNG brand phone . I am very disappointed 😞.

I might say that the perticular handset was defective. I had asked my friends (other users of M40 too). But nobody ever complained this issue.

The phone looks good, and the performance wise average. It is light weight and easy to handle. Especially sound clarity with Dolby Atmos is just amazing, feels like sitting in theater. Camera is not much good, the clarity is poor.  Fast charging .. but, it draining as like fast charging. Bio metric finger lock is working fast as compared to face recognition lock. While calling sound on screen is good. Overall, look wise it is fabulous, camera is not much good, battery is poor. But, Music with Dolby Atmos is awesome.

- Charging wire length is very short
-Automatically second sim get disabled
- Camera photo quality is not upto the mark, need improvement on edges (sharpness).
- Low sound quality
- Premium look

I will not recommend to purchase this phone.
- Interms of camera only MP and numer of camera is increased and photo quality is noy good.
- Gusters are not attractive even you can't take screen shot using guster still using old way (power+vol down)
- Auto screen off doesn't works during the call when you put the phone on the ear.
Really it shows samsung cheapness.

Punch hole display is the best part of Samsung M40 and the most satisfying thing, is the colour contrast and design♡♡♡I'm fully satisfied(^^)  this M40 also contends amazing earphones within ..gaming is totally Awesome ♡_speechless further_
And about disliking part of M40 is we all no it contends 3500mh battery life.. it's not enough  for heavy use.. but it's not like disliking because Samsung company as solved this problem, using fast charger it's always better with fast charger

Night time photos are very dull when compared to daytime. Touch also not working properly  phone getting hanged frequently, when try to drag it was getting clicked. When I try to type touch not working sometimes .... battery was draining very fast...

I have been using the Samsung Galaxy M40 for a little over a month. Before I bought it, I didn't know whether the TFT screen would be as good as an AMOLED screen. Maybe it is different, but I'm not able to see the difference. The performance is very good. And the camera is okay. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy M40 offers excellent value for money.

It's a good phone looks and feel modern
Fingerprint sensor works accurately,
Camera is quite good in sunlight
But doesn't works as expected in low light
The only main problem I find in the phone is its battery
It consist of chip 675 so I thought battery management would be good, that it would last long but still wasn't able to keep up with my hope
Sound screen technology works quite okayish Though I have to say the phone at this price point in amazing

I was looking for 6Gb+128Gb mobile under 15000. There were few options. MI phone was equally good but I have chosen this because of less SAR value.
Pros:
1. sleek design
2. camera quality is food

cons:
1. It is not having universal charger.
2. At a time you can charge or use headphones.
Overall good mobile

I bought this phone just a day back. Phone looks wise it is very good but looks like samsung forgot about the primary feature of a mobile . During the calls phone vibrates and and I am unable to hear the voice from other side . It is realy disgusting. Amazon is also NOT allowing to return this product . 20K is waste of money . I didnt see any reason to use this phone with out basic feature of the phone.

This is my 4th Samsung mobile. The Worst Model Ever Purchased.. Even for returning or replacing, faced lot of difficulties.. Worthless.. Amazon Customer Support for returning it is very bad..

Better go for some below 10k mbl of other brands which is equivalent to this model.... Very Very Worst Experiance with Amazon and Samsung..

The phone does not have a notification light which indicates a pending message or missed call. My previous handset also from Samsung had the notification feature. Also face recognition for starting the phone is very erratic. It says 'no match' on a number of occasions. I feel these features are basic to a handset before packing it with technical stuff.

This is my first Samsung phone. Worth for money. I liked screen and phone is light weight.  I bought sea water blue one and everyone liked that color very much. Video and sound quality is good. I faced some issues in call which was like some disturbance at sometime.You will get pattern, fingerprint and face recognition to unlock. Battery life as well is good. I didn't feel like draining. No heating effect as such. Overall good product for the amount.

The specifications of the phone are amazing in terms of the speed of the processor, the fast charging and the overall design of the phone. However, the camera does have a slight lag while capturing images in low light thereby causing slight blurring of the images. However, for day light photography, it is amazing. The battery should have been atleast 4000 mAh as the battery gets drained within 8 hours of normal usage. However, it is compensated by the fast charging feature.

Awesome smartphone!
Yeah really I mean this phone was just next to perfect for me. In this range I got everything including 6GB RAM 128GB ROM. talking about camera, was cool again.  But again one thing which I believe Samsung could have improved on might be battery as in this range you always expect better,right?
Anyways, type c charging fixes the issue though. And yeah who can forget type c earphones with Dolby Atmos!!
Overall the phone is worth the price.

It is a bad phone with many glitches, it's funny how big Samsung is and they deliver a product like the M40. It is the first phone that I was unhappy with it from the day I bought it. I would probably never buy another Samsung phone in the future.

Battery life and camera are worse than phones from 3 years back.

I will definitely change this phone within a year. waste of money compared to the products in the market.

A very good one at this price range. Samsung has improved the products and the price according to the current market trend. Camera is a bit ok but the battery life and the performance is upto the mark. It works well with the games as well. It would have been much better if the Amoled screen was provided instead of TFT screen. Overall a good one...

Proper network with other handsets
I need help to fix these issues and need a suitable proper replacement as the phone is within warranty period

Was confused between A50 and M40. But not disappointed anymore.
One thing, I was to clarify that the voice quality is absolutely fine. While making first few calls, they exactly tells where to put ear to hear the sound (which many people might have ignored). So you need to put your ear on the contact's photo, which appears on dialling screen.

Camera quality is not "that" much good. But I guess, it will be improved with updates, as is the case with A50.

samsung has nailed it after so long years...
1. screen is awsome guess the best in this segment.
2. touch is really very sensitive.
3. camera is good but guys pls don't compare it with one+...as one+ is way ahead but the camera quality in this segment is the best.
demerit:
battery life is ok not great one...n the fast charging is not as fast as that of one + samsung could work on the fast charging n battery backup..

Using this phone since last one week. Good handset with variety of features. Though battery is 3500 MAH, but good backup as of now. Camera quality and speaker volume is good.
Cons: There is just one Type-C USB, for charging as well as for earphones. No Wireless charging.

Mobile is having on screen speker because of that echo is happening at the time of call and sometimes it's vibrating.camera also not up to mark as the pics taken by the mobile when you zoom it will look like broken.you will find problem with audio jack if you are not using the earphone given by Samsung.
If you are photographer and want to try some affects like bokeh then the pics doesn't not look good.

Samsung Galaxy M40 Disliked : handset used 1 week, 3500 mAh Battery life is week &amp; doesn't stay for full day manufacturer should improve battery more then 5000 mAh, handset heating for continues use, why manufacturer not given cast screen option to connect smart television?

Overall Performance is good. Doesn't hang no lag because of 6GB RAM. Does not heat much. Less weight mobile. Simply superb performance . But camera quality is not up to the mark. It doesn't look like a 32MP quality camera it is more equal to 16MP camera only. But the wide angle feature is too good. It covers an entire room. The front camera is mentioned as 16MP camera but it is also not upto mark. Battery could have been better. Still 3500mAh battery is upto mark. Over All rating 4

Front camera is ordinary one. The main drawback is the screen sound technology. When on call ,it is very difficult to listen with the highest call volume. Moreover, voice clarity is an issue. It's very difficult to listen to other person on call. Now I am using headphon to call someone. I strongly recommend others not to purchase this product unless the technical team resolve the issue

This is the condition of the Sim tray when I opened it . Very delicate piece. Amazon customer service is also very irresponsible. How can the mobile damage within one week. Even Samsung store is demanding 10k for the repair. What's the point in buying the mobile phone for 20k. Neither Amazon nor Samsung is responding correctly. It is mentioned there is warranty for 6 months. Where should the customer claim the warranty😠😠

This is the worst product I buy in my life very worst the battery was fully unsatisfied and the mobile performance was too bad in the speaker it is vibrating lot of times on the call and the song in the gaming was too dull and also the phone was heated a lot in gaming and videos I ask this for the customer support they said this mobile was not designed for games only calls this is the worst experience to buy this mobile

Everything is very good. One of the best phone in 20k range. Though battery life could have been better and some of the default android pie behavior is missing like long press volume key to change music track. Sometimes when a call comes the phone screen doesn't turn on and I have to manually unlock the screen and receive the call from notifications. Apart from these it's very good. Look and build is premium. Display is awsome.

Worst mobile I have ever use. I am using Samsung from last 8 years but this is the worst mobile of Samsung I have ever use. Not seen any good fixture in it. All the fixture will be on paper only but in performance I will not even gave 1 star to this phone.
No Camera Quality
No WIFI &amp; Network quality ( Same sim and wifi is working in same place with other mobile but not in this)
No Good Battery back up.

The phone is good in looks.battery lasts whole day, but will take a little longer to charge.
One thing I am not happy about is the sound quality..during calls it is ok, but when listening to music ,sometimes in the middle there is an abrupt drop/change in quality noticeably..don't know it's just in my phone or is in common..but will sure like to address it.

Sub Rs 20k Category Killer phone by Samsung. Lots of pluses like good battery life, amazing display, gigantic space. Very few cons i found was higher placing of fingerprint scanner and battery of 3500. A very modern and very cool phone to have

Delivered on time by Amazon
But back camera quality is poorest i have ever seen. Not even matching the quality of 5MP camera. Zooming quality is always poor.
Suggest everyone to never buy Samsung phones under Rs 40K.
Now i have to wait for few years to buy good phone having quality cameras.
Samsung should stop attaching cameras to phones under 20k specially.
Even Rajiv Makhini's view also NOT true about cameras quality.

One ui is good.

Screen is good (colors are not punchy).
Back camera is good but front is average. Some issues like poor network reception &amp; screen Sound technology doesn't work well in low network.It is taking 2.5 hrs to charge full(though it has fast charging &amp; small 3500 mah battery).Samsung should address this issue asap.

In Slow motion video quality is pathetic from a phone in this range, In slow motion videos Light flickers, I think samsung should have tested the slow motion in artficial lights before release of phone.

The phone performs well when considering normal use but gets heated up and starts losing battery very fast when playing games.

Another feature that is , the screen sound technology is not up to the mark when compared with normal earpiece sound output.

4.performence very good and smooth
5.very disappointed with battery and fast charging... full charge with in 1.45 hrs
6.earphones and audio quality is fantastic..

Good product but the Return policy is not good in amazon. As if we're asking for return then they are not allowed to return they are trying to diagnose instead of taking the return and refund request.
It was very bad experience. At last I have kept it for sales after 6 days of purchase for 14000 in other site . 5000 lose. Overall phone is good,  except the heating issue while using hotspot. It is good for all the muti tasking and high usage of gaming.

There is an issue with the earphone
It's too difficult to listen calls even in the usual noisy surroundings
Secondly it u can feel heating sensation while listening calls
Third that the concept of no conventional earphone hurts as the sound makes it little vibrate during calls

Phone is good, but I will not suggest anyone to purchase this model of Samsung.
Biggest problem is with its speaker, be it ringeror speaker.
Voice is too low
 I purchased for my mother and thought she would be happy,but after using for an hour she said this phone is just a piece of Junk ,coz she is not able to hear me properly via video call

Inbuilt front camera
Perfect design.
B. Bad about it
Only one colour (blue)

This mobile features are not good as well they describe before launch.
1. camera quality average

3. mobile charger jack and earphone jacks are the same (big drawback)  at same time what we do i.e. if our mobile battery is low how can we listen the music, what we do first...........

Samsung M40 makes me happy by its stunning looks.. The procesor is realy very fast &amp; reponse is very good. Though battery is running down very quickly for its high storage &amp; memory... but its okay that its really take 120 min only to 100%.. the rear camera is at its highest point at this budge compared with any other phone, but shelfie camera littlebit disappoint me.. value for money product.. Thank you samsung &amp; thank you amazon

Worst phone. Finger print sensor is not as good as redmi note 5. Basically, phone audio quality is worst. Most of the time, cant hear from the other end in a call. Such a basic feature,  not working. Battery life is pathetic. Redmi note 5 pro used to come for two days with mobile data, location, wifi switched on. This phone is not lasting beyond a day. Overall completely dissatisfied with this phone.

It's ok only. Camera is worst if we take any picture by zooming in the pictures are getting blurred. Speaker and display are worth. Income call volume is bit low since the speaker is placed at the top. Worth 3 stars. The phone gets heated when we talk in whatsapp.

The Samsung M40 is a phone a person needs .....but the only thing that makes it unworthy is its features.....It can have more features and quality higher than now its has....at this price.....The things which it needs are Amoled display ....48MP camera.....4000 mah battery  and more features in it....Although Snap675 is good but Snap710 is really needed up at this price .....

There is nothing to like expect the looks. Camera always takes blur pictures which you never want to take. After spending 20000 I am not able to take pics on my phone. And battery life is the worst part of the phone. With internet turned On battery runs out in approx 7 hours. Being a high usage user I need to charge my phone 3 times a day...
My mistake to buy this phone.

Camera is horrible, pictures quality is not as per sandards, it seems like Samsung has lost their focus on quality...There is dust in the camera which is not at all acceptable and customer care is pathetic.
Audio Jack and charging are same so you can use one at time or you should have bluetooth every where.
This product was made in hurry keeping quality at stake.

Choosing this set is wasting of money and filling with frustations.

The mobile is handy and good . But the cameras are not as expected in portrait mode  and front facing camera. The battery is meant ok. Not enthralled but satisfied  with the M40 as it has snap 675 and others software features compared to A50 and other mobile and it would be better of Samsung  would have gone for AMOLED. Almost no others flaws but samsung flunked to give AMOLED and better camera quality and battery.

Phone is awesome in look. It feels great to lift in hand and use. It has a premium finish. Fingerprint is very good but face unlock takes time. Camera quality is also very good but sometimes a little noise is there in selfies and after 3-4 days of use i am feeling that battery is draining fast and also battery is taking about 2 hours to get full charged. Overall the phone is best according to me if battery problem is solved by update.

It's not what I'd hoped it would be. Battery performance is the worst. It lasts about 21/2 hours to 3 hours if you continuously watch videos and listen to music. Biometric Reader is much slower on most of the occasions and face unlock takes more than 2 sec at times and doesn't detect the face even if the room is a little bit dark. So my advice is don't go for it. It's a waste of 20k..

This product is approximately 2K expensive than M30 just because of Camera MP. But, 32MP camera is only in written.  This 32MP camera feels like 13MP. Not really happy with this.

Rest, mobile looks decent and other features are superb.

Stylish phone, Love the premium feeling with the Infinity O display. Camera is respectable. Loved the pictures, but can't compare it to premium phones.
Another advantage is it's light weight.
Didn't like the On Screen sound as it give the feeling of hollow sound.
Supports only C type headphone.

Product is not a three slot and I was not satisfied. Amazon refused to replace with three slot phone. Will never again buy expensive item on Amazon. Will use them for grocery so they can go on loss.

Moreover the package was tampered as the ejection pin was misssing.

On the whole a poor show by Samsung and amazon.

Does anyone else have the same problem? I got my fone 1 week ago. Now its repeatedly becoming unresponsive. The prompt reads "system UI not responding "

After selecting close app the fone  restarts on its own. After logging in thru password entry, it shuts again within 30- 45 seconds.

Please don't buy this M40 phone. Main draw back is sound quality. We can't hear properly with whom we are speaking to. Samsung must fix this problem, this is because of display speakers technology. But it's not good at all.
It's heating up rapidly during calls.
Other things are good but basic hearing problem is worst. Worst. Worst.
Zero star.

There's nothing in the name of fast charging, instead this charges even slow than the other phones in the market, yeah but it has fast battery draining feature.

One of the worst mobile phone i have ever bought! Pathetic phone and its performance.  Absolute waste of money. I have been running around like a crazy to get a replacement.  Spoke to amazon customer care , Samsung customer care , but no use ! I would strongly do not recommend this phone to anyone. Amazon customer care sucks !!! World's most customer centric company- is an eye wash !

The model of the phone is really fancy. I love the camera of the phone and super slow - mo and Live focus are my favorite  features of the camera. The positioning of the front camera is quite different but NOT weird at all, you get the infinite display and the black pinhole circle is pretty  negligible. I think the Battery life could be improved a bit. But overall the phone is real good and a must buy.

With massive disappointment, I write that I am not happy with this purchase. Within a month the earphones have stopped connecting.. No words, I have lost trust in SAMSUNG completely. What is the point of buying a new phone and then visiting the service center this early? poor, bad.

The phone and itz specs are worth for the money. Rear cam is good and the features are good.
I didn't like the type c Jack for both charger and headset since while putting headset it is consuming charge and we can't use both at a time. Front cam is more of artificial colors. Phone is heated when talking for more time. Charging is slow with the phone charger. When charged through my c7 pro charger it is charging fast.

Screen is most liked by me... It's infinity 'O' design is awesome feels like full screen....
Poor Face unlock, unlocks even with closed eyes... Fingerprint unlock is alo Ok
Camera is just good in hardware but disappoints in output, phones in 15/16 k range results in good image and you'll feel annoyed when one of your friends did challenge you with same 15/16k device.

I bought Samsung M40 in 19990 ..it's price is too high as compare to phone. It's camera quality is good and battery performance is fine but not going long lasting with heavy game play and pubg is not running well ..when I am playing pubg.this is lacking so much ..so guys if you're pubg player so don't buy this phone ..if you're camera lover then you can go with it ..

Phone is really awesome if we talk about build quality and about the look. I bought this because I was not interested in Chinese phones. Phone is really cool and feels like premium. Only concern is it's camera. In low light front camera is not at the best level but rear camera works very fine witb flash. Overall it is value for money at this price range.

I don't  know why there are so many negative  reviews  are there,

If we compare  camsra with Realme 3pro, realme x or vivi z1 then this has the best camera.I have personally  matched  all three phones

If you want premium  phone in 20k then M40 will be your choice..Best Camera Awesome  look...Looks and feel great  in  hand...Awesome  Display

Processing os faster enough to make experience smoother.

Camera quality is good as well. But, suffers in low light.

Fingerprint and Face Recognition works too good and accurate.

Infinitive O display is superb.

4 starts because of low light camera performance. Otherwise for all other modules, 5* are appropriate .

Don't buy this phone, C charger and headphone Jack is same, once you remove the headset/headphones you can't use it in hand free or headset mode to listen music or call unless you restart. I think SAMSUNG hurried up in launching this phone without addressing or identifying the technical problems, u can never reach the level of I phones. :(

3 months into the buy, the phone is useless. the USB connection/Disconnection notification keeps on flashing, the battery gets drained out and the phone heats up to a level that it might explode. Probably go for a cheaper samsung phone as they keep using high end phone users as guinea pigs. Worthless updates keep slowing the phone down and it is just not worth the money.

I am using this handset for about a week. And there are some issue with the finger print sensor that sometimes doesn't respond. Battery life is above average. Performance is the best. Camera is also good. In 1ui of m40 there are some features missing ie.always on display, screen flash notification, that are available in a50. I would like if they give an update for this and also night mood should have been available

Quality wise good product. A new feature "Voice in Screen" is good but little bit humming the full phone during call. The worst thing is it becomes hot early in a few work only.
Battery and other some features can be increased by Samsung, but compare to this segment, it's not as worth. But there is a brand name. So not bad even. Overall good midrange product.
Samsung has to solve earlier hitting issue and humming issue too.

Primary  camera's  quality  is pretty good but when it comes to the front camera it extremely  below  average.
For me ,the ui ,brand and the looking of punch hole camera is superior  to the camera and battery  that's  why i bought  this. If cameras  and batteries  matter to you better go with some other Chinese  cheaper  smartphones.

The galaxy m40 works  smooth and  fast
The battery is enough to last for about 7 - 8 hours of continuous usage

But it lacks an oled display as that of rest of the Samsung smartphones available in the market
Battery is 3500 instead of 5000mAH

No. Problem with type -C headphones they are fine but bushes are little bit loose

The punchhole display and the look is great

Review after 1 week of use :
I was very confused before buying this phone because of it's LCD display and 3500mAh battery. But after using this for a week it's clear that the battery is more than enough for whole day of use, and the display is amazing. No regrets so far. The camera is moderate though. The wide capture is a perk. The punch-hole display looks great.

I recieved product today itself and have been using it since that time, this is for the first time i have ever purchased a samsung device and this is a really good device. I am really enjoying using it, the device is so smooth in texture, feature like glass feel from back and the infinite touch display is realy amazing.
This is a great device in everything.

Worst phone ever, it doesn't work properly.
Even worst is amazon representative, my phone isn't working and they are telling to install an app on the same phone then only replacement can be arrange, or else keep waiting...... They will be repeating the same statement again and again and will treat you as if you have never ever have seen any smartphone.....

The incoming call speaker cracks &amp; half of the mobile phone vibrates while we speak with the other person. Amazon says that their technician has reported the mobile is working perfectly rather than I showing them the live demo of sound cracking &amp; half the mobile vibrating while on call. Furthermore, this technicians talked with us with Rajnigandha/Manikchand in their mouth...They are not professionals.

Its the best budget phone which gives all the features of a premium smartphone at such a low price.  Even though the price is low, samsung has not compromised on the quality and performance of the smartphone.

The camera is sharp and brilliant.
The feel of the touchscreen is smooth.
The RAM and Internal storage is a huge plus point.
The fingerprint and face recognition is fast.

Likes- Punch hole display, nice OS, finger print reader is working  fine.

Dislikes - Performance of front and back camera is poor. Super amoled screen should have been used instead of TFT display though it works well, battery  should have been alteast 4000mah, 3.5mm jack missing which is really a big disappointment for users. On screen feature  is missing.

Decent camera
Dolby Atmos is great for audio

Bought this mobile, barely used for a month. Stopped charging with the charger provided. Tried with another cable, only to heat so much in few minutes, that it stopped charging. Now Samsung says that they do not cover the charge and asked me to pay for it. Have been using Oppo past 2years, and Moto before. Never had such issues with them

I was using Samsung Galaxy S8 previously from Aug 17 till June 19 and I don't find any difference between S8 and M40. I would say this is the best budget galaxy phone one can own which comes under 20k. Using Offers, I bought it for 18.3k. The camera is good and the battery life is far better as it crosses a day i.e. 24 hours completely since 100% charge with all features and 4G turned on 24*7.

Very impressed with the overall performance. Yes it does lag a bit when heavy games are run but other than that the TFT display, the premium feel and the camera everything are amazing. The 3500 mah battery also surprised me. It lasts longer than my Redmi Note 4 that has 4000 mah. Best phone in budget if you're not a gaming freak and looking for a premium phone. Go for it !

cons:
1. battery could have been better.

2. incall volume is somewhat low due to the new screensound technology(hope they'll solve this issue through  OTA updates)

Firstly I would say that the cocktail orange m40 is surely the best looking phone under 20k. The display is just fantastic.  Just don't listen to people crying for amoled display . For best camera performance use gcam for the selfies and shoot on 3:4h resolution settings for primary camera  and the results would be more than satisfactory.

Recently bought this beutiful phone. Just loved it. It's amazing with its brilliant design n awesome display, very very smooth. Good battery. Not a heavy duty user thus I have 60% battery left even after 24 hrs. Comes with a fast charger. Cameras are good. The only issue I noticed with phone is that it got heats up after few hours of continuous use. But for me its great fun at great price.

Plz avoid buying ....
1 ) Voice quality during the call is very poor. May be due to on display earpiece. Very bad experience. Moreover one cannot replace or return the item. Amazon is not letting to do so
2) phone is heating up very badly...Worst experience battery drains fast...many applications not supported ...voice clarity very bad....

Very poor phone. Due to new on screen technology there is very poor quality of incoming voice n outgoing voice n any speaker related voice. And the worst part is amazon is not helping you regarding this issue. They just said we cannot help you regarding your complains. So in future am not going to buy anything from amazon.
They need only their commissions.

I like the look of the phone. Other than that nothing. Camera quality is very worse. Finger lock is not working at times. Phone is getting  heat when you start surfing for 5 mins. An adequate heat after 15 mins and I am afraid that it may blast at anytime. Pls dont go for Samsung one of friend bought A series with the same problem.

All over best phone under 20k, on screen sound is not much batter thing. Camera quality is great if talking about all these 3 camera combination. Battery time is good but in hotspot it consume most of the battery so avoid it.  I bought it in september and now am sure to gave it 5 out of 5 star.

Output of USB Type-C port for Music is great and In-Box Type-C Earphone. Earphone quality is also Good.
Dislike:- Only two things Battery life could be better and No headphone Jack

Overall, the performance of the phone is really good. The only let down I feel is that the performance of the front camera is poor, especially under low lighting conditions. I wish Samsung could fix this issue with an update. Other than that it has a pretty decent Battery life. The phone feels fast and smooth

Camera: quality is good but not perfect.
Battery: fast charging but backup is little less but adequate.
Appearance: perfect, smooth, classy, adorable...totally mind-blowing.
Sensors: all sensors are working extremely fine.
overall: I will give 4.6 out of 5 ratings.

Nice product must buy.
SAR value just 0.2 so very cool in terms of health. All other company product have high SAR value.
6 GB RAM+ 128 GB ROM is a awesome combo in this price range.
Snapdragon 675 is enough.
Camera very cool.

Just battery is ok.

Otherwise go for it. Not comparable with other mobile brands.

Great Smartphone under 20k budget with features like Punch hole Display , Triple Camera, Customizable OS , 6GB Ram and 128GB Storage.  Feels good &amp; Light in the hand.

In M40, every feature is nice and perfect. Camera quality is very good. Only 1 thing is I think should be better that is battery life. If I play games like Asphalt 9 and pubg continously for 2-3 hours battery goes 100 to directly 35%. But overall I can give 4 star to this phone. Could have gave 4.5 if battery life is better.

I bought this phone 1st july 2019, Everything OK but C port audio jack is big issue. There is big problem in this phone "in display speaker". When you call someone or received any call then you can not hear properly. It seems that phone is vibrating while you are on call. I am thinking to return this phone due to its in display technology

Please dont buy this phone.worst sound ever.its not even audible,lots of distortion and noise.but the worst part is worst service centre they wont even replace your phone if you are not satisfied.they will make you do a stupid test which doesnt give any result and you will have to be stuck with the phone even if you are not happy with it.

1. Display quality is just below average, though touch response is good
2. Call quality is very poor, voice of the person speaking from other side is barely audible. Voice quality during the call is very poor. Sounds Robotic and its really hard to understand the caller. May be due to on display earpiece. ... Very bad experience

Samsung M40 starting from the adds and promo from amazon its created huge buzz. And it's delivered the same in the product as well. Well crafted design with display.
Given type c quality headphone which is smart move .
Snapdragon processor which is the biggest positive.
Ram &amp; storage will definently serve your money .
Best and reliable @ this price range .

Finger print reader is very fast. Camera quality is very good in a day or night.Battery life not bad. I am playing pubg 5 to 8 matches in a day.

Superb phone. Awesome body and design. The glass back looks beautiful. The best thing on this device is the powerful Snapdragon 675 chipset. The screen quality is awesome. Fluid like touch and an awesome camera too. The wide angle lens is awesome. Speakers are also pretty decent
Only one con- no 3.5mm headphone jack but thanks to Samsung for adding those type c earphones

Samsung M40 mobile handset very modern design
With infinite O display. It's looking amazing.
According to price, the camera is fantastic. Low light
The picture is not accurate but its sharpness is good.
During game play, it's quite heating. C type charger
 is nice but C type headphone Jack is not a good idea.
And there is no Samsung pay support.

Please do not purchase this product as it is restarting daily automatically without any intimations and apps also getting closed without error message, after 6 GB RAM performance is not that much good.
Manufacturer don't for 6 GB RAM and 128 storage how much power will get consumed that battery must 5000 MH atleast.

The voice quality of speakers during calls is not at all good. Please try to improve it during a software update. The front camera isn't worth 16MP, it looks like a 5MP or lesser. The back camera of 32MP alone is not cool at all. The pixel breaks and very poor inside houses where there is poor lightening.

If u charge fully and keep ur phone in switched off for a day and then turn on the phone.  Your battery will have only 20% charge.  Imagine if ur phone is in switched on mode.  U will not get the battery for couple of hours.  Worst phone by Samsung.  Raised complaint with Amazon.  Engineer visit scheduled.

A very good mobile from Samsung in this price range. The overall performance of the device is nice and the infinity o display gives a premium look. Everything is good but just the front camera needs some improvement and also if this mobile was available in black colour I would have liked it more.
But overall a pretty decent price for this amazing Galaxy M40 mobile.

Finger print reader doesn’t recognise the print unless it is done is particularly correct angle, was bit surprised that just 4 hours of continuous use age drains the battery down and was left with just 10% while my previous phone which had same mph battery usually lasted 6 to 7 hours before getting to 10%

1.Main  drawback of this mobile is not fast charging mobile. It's taking nearly 2 hrs of time get full charge. 😥
2. Most of the videos (like prime,via, airteltv etc )are not playing on full screen mode.🙄
3. Not supporting Samsung pay.😑
4. Good thing is , liked sound screen technology. 👍

A perfect midrange phone offered by Samsung with a powerful processor and brilliant camera that allows us to capture beautiful images.The finger print sensor responds quickly. One thing I loved the most was the placement of front facing camera which occupies very less space and helps us to use the entire screen without  any interruption.

I have received this phone 3 days back &amp; needed to charge at-least thrice a day.
Though i just waiting couple of more days, as might due i have lot of backup downloading.
But usually battery consuming about 20% in 1 hr only while watching online.
Camera just Ok, but my previous Phone A7-2018 was having better camera.

Love the phone. Snapdragon processor works really fast without any lag. Love the screen resolution. Great clarity and viewing angles. Camera quality is not that good as it pixelate when you take picture. Since camera is not my priority so it works for me. Also the volume from speaker is not that loud but does the work. I am really happy and satisfied with this phone😊

Samsung M40 with 6GB ROM and 128 GB internal memory is a excellent mobile with very resolution rear camera and sensitive finger touch. It's a treat watching video in full screen and working on net with fast processor. Battery life is fairly ok as of now however it is to be seen in long term. Overall a mobile value for its money and strongly recommended for purchase.

Awesome phone.
Good display with punch hole camera.
Awesome to watch the videos.
should have improved  battery back up and camera.
low variant phones have amoled display and this one lacks it
Screen sound technology  is worst
Should have sold only through flash sale .
Discontinuing flash sale has completely brought down its market.

lags, mediocre gaming performance, lack of sAMOLED visible, comes with corning gorilla3 when other devices are equipped with gorilla glass5. Stuttering and lag in apps within 2 weeks of use.
Battery life is less than a day and only 5 hrs when used for gaming/streaming. Camera quality average. This one is overpriced by at least 2,500RS.

First of all SamsungM40 is having plasic body, so it doesn't look premium. The battery gets drain off in 8 hrs. Mobile gets heated up while it is in function. The camera is having a funtion called super wide is good for taking group photos but the photos are bit distorted. Mandate : for this price u can get better offers.

You get a super smooth operating system and good processor. The battery is 24 hours plus range. However, at this price point, we expect improved hardware, better camera sensors, night photo.

Poor vibration and sound. Samsung should take note of this.

Hugely Dissatisfied, I buyer the phone 2 months ago, 5 days after I broked up my screen after that till today I am not able to get that part of screen. No screen replacement like other companies phone, no responsibility of part by Care. And the expected price of part is  around 8000 which is the half amount of phone

The product is not worth for the money. The camera quality is not upyo the mark at all. Battery drains fast after using 6 months. Split screen facility is not available. Hanging of mobile even without full memory is also an issue. Slow response of sensors like compass, temperature etc. I donot recommend this mobile.

I am really disappointed with the camera.
I think Samsung install 3.2MP camera instead of 32MP.
The camera is worse than the camera on another phone.
The on-screen speaker is very bad.

Good phone. Value for money. Samsung's software needs more refinement. But no better alternatives. Note below:
Reset phone on delivery for better camera experience. Phone doesn't light up for incoming notifications.

Battery capacity is insufficient.  Front camera is beyond bad. Its said that front camera is 16mp. But I think its false information.  Maybe Samsung  wanted to write 1.6 mp or max 6mp but wrote 16 mp by mistake. Also, have started facing range issues just when I started using this phone.

Bought it as a gift and now I feel stupid. You don’t want to gift someone special and then have them run around service centers for a stupid phone. Basic call functionality doesn’t work. Too noisy to talk. The speakers for call feature are the worst thing ever invented. I personally never liked Samsung, this buy just gave me a reason to hate it.

very very very bad product from Samsung.
i suggest every one should buy a50 i stead of m40.
when you talk over phone whole sreen seems like vibrating.
camera quality is very poor
and hangs on continues use.
i suggest that no one should buy this phone except the full screen it has nothing.

A good phone for a affordable  price.  Good attempt by Samsung. The O'corner front camera adds to the beauty of this lil masterpiece.
Pros:

Smooth touch
Great UI

Cons:
Commmon slot for earphone &amp; charger
Ear phones  quality
Missing blue light filter(hope it is back in near furture updates)

Samsung launched this all time best mobile phone. I think it is real a smart phone. Only one problem is that battery life is only 3500MAH that is only take in consideration. All the Games you want to play on any Graphics is too superb. I played PUBG &amp; freefire on full Graphics and is unbelievable.

The snapdragon processor and 6 gb of ram allow the smartphone to carry multiple tasks with ease. The camera unit is satisfactory for me as I am not a heavy user of the camera. The battery life is sufficient. The fingerprint reader however sometimes fails to work properly which is an inconvenience.

It's annoying. Waste of money. Camera is not at all good. I couldn't eject sim tray. Amazon delivered faulty device. Camera quality is really very bad. I didn't expect this from Samsung. Even I don't like this design too. After long struggle,
At least received refund for this. Better I'll go for A50 Redmi.

The fingerprint reader unlocks phone very quick and the camera quality is superb as it gives 32mp back camera and the selfie camera is great only in terms of battery life the people who plays games contiously for 4-5 hours have to charge their phone in between the game but for the people who play only for 1-2 hours for them this device is great.

I seriously loved the mobile it's very good and the battery life is decent, the camera is awesome I loved the camera the camera performs good in low light conditions also. Snapdragon 675 is really good and it performs very good while playing games there is no lag or something like that. The phone is simply smooth. It's worth for the price rate.

I got this product with tempered glass recommended on Amazon's website (Comoro).
The tempered glass doesn't fit &amp; covers the front camera.
Samsung shouldn't release products if they cannot provide accessories.
Amazon shouldn't show false pictures if they do not have the right fits.

Overall the phone is good.
Excellent build quality,
Average battery life,
Good performance,

Screen sound technology is annoying, you wont be able to hear the other person in traffic or noisy areas, you may hear robotic voice. It might be a bad option for people with heavy calling usage.

I've ordered the phone on 18th July. Got it delivered in 2 days. My experience with the phone had so far been great. The camera quality and infinity o display is worth mentioning. The infinity display gives the phone a classy look. Battery life is also great. To sum it up, Samsung M40 is definitely a good option among phones in the 20k budget.

The phone is definitely not upto the mark at its price point. I have talked about what I liked and what I didn't in my YouTube channel. Goto YouTube and search "Vish Talks" talks and not talk. And watch the video for complete information. Don't buy before watching and if you have any doubts comment there.

Only thing battery could've been 4000 or above. Because I was using continuously like gaming movies Facebook and watsapp. It is lasted me for 6.5 hours.

The phone offers features that are not worth 20K.  Battery drains very fast, the screen is not AMOLED, camera 32mp etc. Within 14k range, you can get a better smartphone-like Galaxy M30s, with better features, 6000mah battery and 42mp camera with AMOLED screen.

All in All, the phone is a great value for money. The battery life is impressive. The Sound on Display tech will take some time to get used to. The Camera overall is good at this price point. However, the wide angle pictures tend to get blurry at the sides sometimes. The display though not AMOLED still has good viewing experience.

Overall phone is good... But it could be more effective with upgraded chipset of Snapdragon 855.

Sound quality in headset is ok (Not Bad).

Front camera in M40 is not upto the mark, there is too much of softness included.

No Case provided in box.

Overall M40 is good hand piece for budget of 20k.

The main feature of a mobile phone is having a problem. You can feel vibration n echo of voice while talking on phone..
Samsung needs to work on the hardware to solve this issue or sell bluetooth  headphones with phone..

Great phone. Does what is promised. One UI is smooth and easy. Fingerprint scanner has gestures but some more would have been nice. Not a lot of gesture contols but overall great product.
Camera quality is nice and the wide angle is great. Great phone in this range.

everything about this phone has been pretty good so far except my experience with the cameras...grains appear in the front camera and the detailing in photos is pretty bad as well in artificial light.IF this problem is solved with software update ...this device is a total beast in every aspect.

My phone is not working, it says that there is a latest technology on this model. That is- no ear piece and on screen sound technology. However with in 2 weeks this is not working. Highly disappointed. Hope the team can do something about it. I have all the bills.

Switching back to Samsung device after 6yrs of using Motorola and I am loving it. Like the colour it's different. Very light, performance is good and no lagging. I am not a gamer so not sure how the phone performs with game.

Think before you buy this model as you cannot hear the voice on the reciever clearly as all the instrument have same problem and they are not going to take it back and will give you replacement which also has the same problem. you are duped.

Phone look is fine but proper handling is required if you are using it without back cover. Too scratchy. Battery performance is moderate. Amazon / Samsung should provide back plastic cover atleast as I waited for its availability in the market/site. Even now good covers are not available post 10 days of launch.

It was just around 36 hours that I received this phone that its battery stopped charging. The issue was not with the data cable. I tried multiple chargers, but the phone would not charge. It did cause me lot of problems as I had to again change my phone. I would not recommend this phone.

Samsung galaxy M40 has amazing display with full hd infinity -O display.  Processor is strong so it works smoothly . Battery is 3500 MAH which is enough still 4000 would be better.  Fingerprint scanner is not that good.  It take time to unlock when device is sleeping.
Overall its a nice device I like it .

Main objective of the Mobile is to speak but the clarity is lacking in this model , not able to clearly hear the other person. I wish Amazon being the Launching partner for Samsung should help its customers to fix this critical issue.

Camera: Medium. (both front and back side)

Fingerprint reader and battery life is good or i would say amazing.
Just facing issue with camera quality , the ultra wide angle make me happy but the captured photos colour are not natural. It seems whitish... though I'm sure Samsung will give an update on it.
Overall I'm  very happy  with the M40.

Straight to the point:
1. Camera quality is below average.
2. Battery drains as its life has already expired.
3. Filled with OS bugs.
4., Sound quality of calls is also worst.
Even after reading this review if you buy this phone, you'll be a proud fool.

This phone is the worst phone from samsung I have ever used. This model has a major problem of proximity sensor. I have complaint about it and get the replacement but again within 2 days same problem came of sensor not working. Worst phone from samsung.

But the only flaw I found is the speaker. We can hear a little cracked voice while on a call. But its not that major. The features are best. I think its worth it. One should buy this phone. Its smooth and a fine product.

Face detection takes a bit more time than expected to unlock.
Battery performance could have been better.
Charging time is almost 2 hours from 0 to 100.
Rest of the phone performance wise phone is good. Satisfied with the phone at this price.

Phone Not up to mark as per the price. While watching video you cannot attend call using head phone. You have unplug and then again plug in the head phone to connect call.

The camera quality is indeed fabulous along with the new UI interface. Not to forget that the processor is immersive and powerful and the lifetime of the battery for that matter does give you a day's backup but it could've been more. Altogether, a great budget device and you should Go for it!

This phone has all features of premium smartphones, this phone only lack behind in 3.5mm headphone Jack, 4000mah battery and super amoled display, and there can be 2 sim or 1 sim with 1 memory card so I expect there should be 2 sim slot with one memory card slot

I face problem in listening to the calls may be because it is a full display phone and I don't know where they have fixed the headphone may be anywhere behind the screen  due to which I feel like I am listning from speaker.

Battery life:

I'm not a gamer. I'll use phone just for calls,WhatsApp &amp; sometimes for shopping apps.

If I start using phone with 100% battery. By Eod, it will be at 15% charge remaining. I have stopped auto sync on my mobile to extend the battery lif me.

What's the use of creating a powerhouse if you can't have it power on for long time. Battery don't even last for 12 hours. I regret replacing my Xiomi Note 7 with Samsung M40. I paid premium price for a mere cheap battery product. Innovation at it worst!!!!

Worst phone by Samsung. Very poor quality of camera I thought that by two camera aperture it will work better but soory to say it doesn't deliver.. read Mi 7 (which is cheaper than 7 k) is better choice than M40. Or better to go for One plus 7

Galaxy M40 is almost best. Comparitively bit poor perfomance with realme, oppo, redme.
Also it can be improved the fingerprint reader  camera quality and ofcourse the battery life.

Honest Review
Worst Battery Life ever seen in my life. While having a call for 10-12 mins mobile heats at tremendous level. Camera quality is quite OK.
In this price range you should not buy this mobile.
Worst experience ever.

I have been using this product from one week, the speaker quality is of low standard. The product can’t be replaced or return as the sound quality issues can’t be detected by the app they asked to install. Overall don’t waste your 20k bucks buying such an useless product

Not worthy

Camera quality with 32 MP is not that much good. Night photos are more noisy and blurry. Fingerprint scanner is very impressive. Unlocks the phone immediately. Battery life stands for 1 day if 4G is used and almost one and half day if WiFi is used.
