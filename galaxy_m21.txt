I have ordered this product on 5th May 2020 and received it on 12th May 2020. The USB cable of the charger is faulty and the cap of the tip is loose. I almost ended up getting an electric shock while removing it from charging. Called the customer care and the Customer Care associate Prem was getting bothered by our calls as we were seeking exchange of the USB cable. We didn't get any satisfactory solution and hence writing this review. Highly disappointed with Amazons customer care department. Though been a regular customer, didnt expect this sort of after sales service

Review after 3 Day..

1. Battery :- 5/5
Two day battery standby for normal easy

2.Display:- 4.99/5
Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display

3.Design:3/5
It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. No
glass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..  In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers

4. Camera: 3/5

Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low..  many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..

5. OS&amp;UI:- 5/5

Android 10 with One UI

6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5
 Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast

7.Processor and performance 3.5/5

Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers  .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer..  No lag ang hang till now..  but processor is outdated..

8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone

9. Accessories : 2/5

No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard..  So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..

Verdict: For this price  Its the best choice for a non gamer  ...

I am writing my review after using it for 6 days
.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.
Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

Value for money.
I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.
I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.
But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.
As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

Looks like just to clear the unsold stock of m30s they gave it a new name and advertised it as a totally new phone. Everything is similar to m30s, except the price (and selfie camera). Good thing is that they kept the price low.

Just got it delivered today. So far so good, many users compalined about battery, charging speed, display issues on m30s. Hope they got it resolved in m21.

Even realme performs better.....few issues which concerned me after use were
1. When recording slow motion videos...there is
  always flicker on screen.
2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work
3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi
4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming
5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone
6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue....

Suggestions for people who have bought this phone.....
Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early...

Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone.....
If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....

I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..

A nice looking phone.
Light weight because of the plastic body. Performance is pretty good.
But it doesn't feel like a 6000 mAh battery. Probably a little shy of that figure. It Drains relatively quickly than what is expected of a 6000 mAh capacity.
But overall a product worth it's price. Probably not good for high performance gaming.
But expect it to be durable with a low-medium usage.

The phone(M21 Raven Black) is not working properly since its purchase. After the first installation, it is on frequently on and off mode and even restarts after more than 30 minutes. Moreover 4-5 times it takes more than 2 hours for starting.
I also register a complaint to Amazon regarding this. I don't need such a disgusting phone any more. it wastes my 3 days. So, I request to Amazon kindly refund my money, I don't need replacement.

I like the camera quality, screen sensitivity,  and browsing experience. The speed is excellent.
I don't like it's sound. The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours.

At this cost, the phone looks premium. For folks who like a premium looking phone not the fancy looking phone, this is the best at this price segment. all other products at this price bracket consist of fancy and decorated back which may not be the cup of tea for a section of people for whom simple and plain is the premium. Monster battery, One of the best display at this price segment, great finger print sensor, decent camera etc.. If you are a non gamer, go for it...

Only problem i faced is delay in delivery (almost 10 days).

I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21.
The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED display
The issues I faced are
1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera
2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside
3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).
4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.
Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k

The phone is simply amazing. The Raven Black model looks gorgeous. Very sturdy. The camera quality is excellent. The UI is user friendly. This phone is similar to the Samsung range of phones, so it is hard to decide the model that's best for its price. According to my analysis, M21 is a good by at 12699/-.

Samsung Co. Claims that Samsung M21 has fast charging facility and It has 6000 mAh battery but these two claims are totally bogus because I've purchased Samsung M21 and received my order yesterday after using this phone I plugged in charger for charging it took approximate 9 hours to charge the Mobile phone and after full charging approximate 2 hours the Mobile phone battery get reduced 50%. I'm totally disappointed with this phone.

There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone.

1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever.

2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone.

Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give.

Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm.
Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge.

Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone.

For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.

Amazing phone But m not satisfied with camera quality, its 48MP? I used samsung galaxy S8 its only 12MP single camera which is good for m21 tripple camera.
One more thing is back panel is plastic which is not good looking inthis range ..Its not feel premium with this budget....

The best to choose among the available choices in this range.  I am using it since one week and I am fully impressed with all the features. The camera quality and battery life are excellent. Fingerprint reader is very fast.  Elegant design and wonderful display. The user interface is also very good.  Only difficulties I faced was to find app lock and split screen. But these purposes were fulfilled by external apps from the play store.

I strongly recommend purchasing this phone. The best value for money product. I am full satisfied with the purchase üòä

Great phone. There is no overheating like others say. For the price you getting a quality phone with massive battery life.
Here are the pros:-
Good quality
Excellent display
Excellent battery
Best camera

Here are the cons:-
Speaker quality is not good. It's loud but distorted at high volume with no bass at all

Headphone quality is ok. Not the best. I prefer wireless because of Dolby Atmos

Charging speed is ok, not fast nor slow. It took 2hrs to fully charge. It's fast for 6000mah

Camera app need a redesign

Aside all this.. it is the best phone under 15k.

Go for it.

I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card.

 I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.

Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.

M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacks

M21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11

This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50s

Battery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.

Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.

Pros:
Super amoled screen
6000 MaH battery

Cons:
Signal strength is very poor.
(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)

Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc

I got this phone on 15th of May.I am writing this review  after 5 days of usage...
1.Battery backup is not very good. It's good but not like 6000mah at all.Also charging is really slow.
2.It's SAmoled screen is best in this price range.
3. Processor is not very powerful,I have noticed some occasional lags.
4.Heating issue detected in front camera areas
It's not like overheat or something but it is hot.
5.Os is good but there is no network speed meter function present natively.
6.FB app is keep refreshing it's feed when I minimize and open the app again after some time.
7.Sometimes app crashes without any reason.
8.The phone is heavy not too heavy but you can easily notice it after some day's of usage.
9.At 12699 price I don't think there is any other phone is as good as this is,atleast for now.
10.It doesn't have Good lock and native screen recorder present in OS neither you can sideload them.This is unfair I think.

The phone have good build quality. Although it's plastic it doesn't feel fragile. It is very compact and easy to hold. Weights similar to note 5 pro.

 Display: awesome is the word. No need to explain further.

Battery: Lasts through 2 day for normal users.

Rear Camera: now this is disappointing to be honest. The back cam takes pictures which are only slightly better than my note 5 pro. The poco images are way ahead. Samsung just oversaturates the greens and the pictures lack clarity on zooming .No comparison with X2.

Front cam- Actually here it did impress me. Takes better images than both note 5 pro and poco x2.
Wide angle: takes pictures which are similar to those taken by poco.

Processor: it's not bad but is visibly slower than poco and comparable to note 5 pro in day to day tasks. I think the one ui is really heavy. I ak yet to try any games.

So that's it guys it is bang for buck for the money. But be clear about your preferences. It's not a phone for gaming and stellar camera performance. But a great one for media consumption and day to day tasks. Also takes ok pictures with the main cam and impressive images with front cam.

1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon.
2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor.
3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that.
4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them.

It‚Äôs better to buy from local store than going behind Amazon.

This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.

Good:

- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
- Received next day by 11 AM !

Not So Good:

- Not that thin, but ok.
- Doesn't have Samsung Dex
- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.
- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)
- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.

Feedback

- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.
- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.

Go for it without any doubt.

Worst phone of my life I have ever purchase . Due to this pandemic situation and blaming china for this corona virus I have decided to purchase a korian company phone . But I broke up my trust .

Bcuz it's drain so quickly processor is very slow it's hang up in 5 minute and heat like u can make your veggie on this even it's can burn ur ears finger print is not responding I have washed my hand many time but it's not ready to recognize it's.

Perfect mobile phone with more storage space, Excellent sound quality with Dolby atmos ,extended battery life ..I tried to use full night to watch OTT web series.. morning 42% of battery life is pending.. if you keep volume less than 50% we can't hear any sound ..company should improve this .. we can't keep volume with 100% at all time... Inbuilt functionality of install 2 social apps like WhatsApp ,FB etc., my suggestion .. if you are looking for phone less 15000 with so many features. This is one of the best model to look:)

I got the delivery yesterday. My last phone was Poco F1. M21 is a good phone at this price point. as its a big battery with 15W charging capacity it will take anywhere between 2.5 to 3 hrs to charge but once charged it can easily go for 2 days for non-gamer. Camera is good at this price point.
The best thing is its Samsung, which has good after service and if you take samsung care + home pickup and drop. for M21 2 years the price of care+ is Rs1349 with everything covered except theft

recently i ordered samsung M21 6GB RAM 128GB Flash.
Unboxed and started the phone. it surprised to see so much of heated while booting itself.
I tried to inform to Amazon . they tested with some remote diagnostics application surprisingly it showed the temperature is degree.
I am using Samsung phones long time. this time my experience with M21 is very very bad

This is an overhyped phone. Don't believe in all the 5 üåü reviews .
1st battery is ordinary - It doesn't work like 6000mah. In 14hrs it came from 100% to 25% ( screen on time 4.5hrs, few calls, WhatsApp, one movie and some Facebook) which is almost same as my previous phone with 3500mah battery.
2. Phone heats up  even on light browsing in firefox
3. Network reception is very poor, I used to get full signal in my previous realms phone where as in this it's two bar less all the time ( even when I go to terrace. And call quality is average
4. There is no network speed or data consumed in a day. ( This cannot be called as smartphone when it doesn't have these basic features)
5. Adaptive brightness doesn't work most of the time.
6. Camera, both front and back is pretty good. Best part is it doesn't smoothens the skin.
7. I don't play games so can comment on how it process heavy games, but for me all apps functions like breeze.
8.Only thing I like is display which is really good as black colour is really black on this display and audio through headphone is nice

Previous generations of Samsung phones used to provide better quality though. This one provides excellent specs for the price, but doesn't come with earphones and its charging cable is very short. I have to use a USB extension cable to make up for that. Operation is real smooth and lots of space. Camera is okay, battery is great but that's the "standard" in the age of Mi. Fingerprint reader frequently fails. Lots of features I enjoyed in the older Galaxy J7-6 are missing though. Thankfully almost all my customizations are preserved thanks to Smart Switch. Still for a Samsung phone it has too much bloatware. Thankfully I am able to disable all of them. Guess that's why the low price, I'm content with it, with this RAM, storage and battery it'll make overall usage comfortable.

Before I go into details, let me admit that I was a staunch "hater" of Samsung Android phones, specially in the low mid range. The first and last Samsung phone I used was a Galaxy Core, back in 2012. I absolutely hated it, and promised to never buy a Samsung phone ever. But then there was an ad and I purchased this M21.. Samsung again, after 8 years. And during these 8 years, I have used Sony Xperia, Moto G, Redmi 4, Redmi Note 7 Pro. So my review is actually a comparison of those phones with this beast.
The major advantage of this phone, compared to my Moto G, is the brilliant sAmoled display with Full HD resolution (not 720p, thank God).
Processor is so optimised for this phone that it works like a breeze and stays cool like, unlike my both Redmi's. I dont bother the fact that its not a Snapdragon. Performance and usability is so much optimised that you shall never complain.
Battery backup is a perfect two day affair, for more than normal usage. Screen on time is excellent. I can easily go through 2 days even after streaming web series and talking a lot on phone calls.
The only thing that bothered me is the finger print sensor. Its not a feather touch one, definitely. But it still works pretty good, once you put your finger on inlt properly.
For me, its a very good deal under 15k. Would recommend this to anyone, even when blind folded!

the battery is too good and pubg works fine too.i reccomend not going for brands like mi realme and other chinese brands
bloatware free (adfree) one ui is even better than stock android. camera is fine too.
Another thing is that dont go for the realme 6 or 6 pro for its 90 hz display because its ips lcd.amoled 60 hz is way better than that.

When I start hotspot in this phone, and try to connect laptop to it, it fails. When I make hotspot with any other phone, my laptop connects instantly, but only with this phone's hotspot, it keeps on rotating the cursor, or says "can't connect to this network". I need urgent help with this otherwise I will have to get it replaced.

Recieved it today.
1) Battery is excellent- can last for 2 days with average usage.
2) Camera is good according to price of Mobile- Don't expect DSLR level clarity but it's good.
3) Phone is running without any lag. not a gamer so haven't run any game.
4) Network and voice clarity is excellent. Haven't faced any problem.
5) Touch ID is respsonsive.

I would say in this price segment, the phone comes with excellent qualities.

Phone is upto the mark according  to  the  price.
‚Ä¢Charging is 4/5 little slow but the battery life  is just awesome.
‚Ä¢Camera is 4/5 but considering the price  this is  the  best you can get.
‚Ä¢Fingerprint  is 4/5 sometimes it doesn't  respond to the finger quickly  but it is  good  as it has quite  fast response.
‚Ä¢Display  is just awesome 5/5. With  wideline L1 certification  you can actually  watch  4k videos. If you watch movie/webseries frequently this phone is for you.
‚Ä¢This phone is not made for heavy games but it can easily play  less heavy games like subway  surfer etc.
Hope this helps :).

No doubt i am loving Samsung m 21 4/64, which i ordered on 25th may, got delivered on 27th may. One thing to consider, this smartphone excels in display, camera quality and battery life...Processor is not that  powerful or not even close to sd 675 in terms of gaming. I have to use gfx tool, lowering resolution( less than hd) and other graphics stuff to Low with fps set to ultra(40fps). By applying this gfx tools settings i can play Pubg hell lot better with stable 30-40 fps. Dont try extreme,fps will be very unstable. With stock Pubg settings i am facing tremendous lags, stutters and fps drops even in the lobby, Cant say about 6/128 gb model. Didn't try Cod, i usually dont play, Pubg lite plays fine with smooth extreme option only. My verdict if u are not too much into gaming, Play clash of clans, or can adjust to above settings of Pubg, Go ahead to buy,  If pubg is top priority go with Vivo U20/Realme 6/Redmi note 9.

I have just used it for three days, but I had to tell you it's an amazing phone. It's  a great phone in the mid range though MI has a better variant at lesser price but hey stay away from China. Coming back to the phone the fingerprint sensor is great, display is mindblowing , battery backup great, camera is decent enough for me though when you compare to redmi's variant little below par.

6GB RAM, 128GB storage, colour black

1. When recording slow motion videos...there is
always flicker on screen.
2. Camera is just awesome
3. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming
4. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone

Suggestions
If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....

Display 10/10
Build 8.5/10
Camera 9/10
Battery 10/10
UI or OS  9/10
Chipset performance 8/10 (not good for hardcore gamers)
Heating performance 8/10 ( normal temperature on a higher side)
Signal strength, call quality 9.5/10
Value for money 10/10
Recommended ? Surely go ahead, if you are not going to play pubg full time on it.

A very good phone at this budget. You may get some fancy specs at same price from Mi or any other chinese manufacturer but the differentiating factors are screen, battery &amp; camera.  Samsung AMOLED screens are the best in phones. You simply can't get a better screen from any other vendor. You only can compare with another samsung phone.  Battery of 6000 mah last sa min of 2 days even for a heavy user. Camera is very good. Face unlock works very well.  Only cons i experienced was that with all the gear like case and temper glass it looked a bit bulky. But larger screens have become a norm and that's manageable to me.

My own experience of 3 days:-
Battery- not working good as expected 6000 mah,it's looks like 3500mah.
Camera-this is pretty good ,image quality is good.
Fingerprints-some times fails to read ir fingerprints otherwise it's good .
Network- I'm facing network issues with this phone ,internet connection some time collapse,and also my relatives complaint that he can't able to call me,but I can call him(it's happening since 3 days when I insert my Vodafone 4g sim in my new phone....
Otherwise performance is good.

After 14 days of use,
0verall review: Satisfactory, NOT very good.
1.  1st of all, I am not using any gaming app, still the phone gets hanged up.
2.  Fingerprint reader: Very low quality, doesn't work most of the time. Have to open using pattern, MOST FRUSTRATING ONE.
3.  Camera:  Being 48 megapixel, it's OK.
4.  Battery:  though it's 6000 mah, it's ok.
5.  Network issue:  Always low in network data as compared to my other phone.
My 1st and last phone from Samsung.

Regualr updates are required to boost system and software  performance.
Camera is awesome rear and front.Functions are smooth and buttery .Watching movies and videos are very pleasant.But Some of the bloatware and third party apps  like Helo,likee,etc are yuck and must not be preinstalled. Thank God We can uninstall  them.
Go for it .You wont regret except for regular android updates. only Feb month software update is provided so far by default. DONT KNOW if they provide regular security update or not.But it's  performance is by far smooth and well.While Doing DUO video call I felt heating of phone.Let's  see if it is improved in next security update.Samsung should provide headphones,back cover, tempered  glass with phones at their end.
Regards,
Edit:31may 2020
Yesterday  took 30/40 photos and my phone Galaxy M21 appeared hot.Photos were quite good.What astonished me is this phone's  battery management .It generally takes three days to discharge.Actually I am a moderate user So It's expected but want the same performance in future. Samsung's own EXYNOS processor needs overhauling in comparison  to qualcom snapdragon and media  tech..
Will add further information in due course
02 june2020
YouTube playback is sometimes stuck which I Experienced two three times.Software update is major issue.
My preused samsung headphone is not compatible with its Jack.Loose .So doesn't works it ought  to be.
My Nokia is much better than this phone is every aspect.Not a single time Hang or stuck during any usage.
Samsung's  main problem is its processor which is required to be reengineered.

After reading a lot of reviews regarding network issues of the M31 and M21 I was a bit skeptical to buy the M21. I was using Huawei honor phones until now because of their excellent call quality and network reception. After using the Honor 6x and Honor Play I was thinking of buying the Honor 9x pro but after I found out that it did not support Google Play I opted out. So then I began researching other brands and I came across the Galaxy M21. The features were promising but the negative reviews regarding network held me back. By chance I happened to come across a video in YouTube regarding LTE / 3g / 2g settings in the M21. Bingo! I knew where the problem was. So without waiting any longer I ordered this smartphone.
After receiving it and using it for a few days I am glad my decision was correct. In fact the call quality and  network reception of the M21is much better than the Honor phones which I have been using for a long time.
The reason why this network issue arises is because after inserting the Sim and starting the M21 the OS of this phone selects the LTE/3G/2G (auto connect) option in Mobile networks by default. I am using Jio Sim and Jio is only 4G. Now if by chance the 4G signal becomes a little weak the phone will search for 3G or 2G signal and in doing so the call or network signal may drop or get cut altogether since Jio is only 4G. So if I select the LTE only option the phone will latch on to the 4G signal even if it becomes a little weak.
So for those who have Jio Sim and have network issues I will suggest that (1) select LTE only option in Mobile networks (2) In Access Point Names open 3 vertical dots and Reset to default and immediately reboot or restart the phone. I hope this helps.

I am posting this review upon using this device for 5 days.
-Camera is ok, I would like to mention "Megapixels " doesn't work if you really don't have the quality camera, but for the money what you pay it's okay to bare üòú
-Display is pretty decent
-Battery is a monster yet it takes time to fully charge 3hrs needed from 20% to 100%, but you won't have to search for a charger for whole day(I am not a gamer hence don't know how it will work with gamers )
If you are really looking for a budget friendly phone go for it.

Network reception is poor connection vanishes many times..
It only works good  with jio beacause, jio have Samsung RF units on their tower .
This phone doesn't work properly with airtel and Vodafone idea.
Amazon doesn't have return options very bad replacement serve. Call center agents are just to confuse you. They are not returning and refunding me.. i can't use jio.. network is very poor in our area, this phone doesn't work with airtel and Vodafone idea . So the worst purchase i have till the date... Now I'm hate Samsung and Amazon...

Seriously don't buy it, always there is some or other issue, sometimes hanging,  sometimes call disconnects , sometimes voice not coming, touch issues. I was using Nokia 6 (too, old phone) when I was waiting for it, but still it was better then this.
I got a replacement for this phone, but the replaced one also having different kond of issues.
I was eagerly waiting for this phone in lockdown, but TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.
Now putting it for refund.

I am writing this review after using for 4 days. Here is my thoughts and opinions.

1. Looks and Feel: 4/5. The phone looks like a premium phone when unpacked and feels comfortable in hand for a standard adult. The back panel however is plastic and is a fingerprint magnet. Not satisfied with the back panel.

2. Fingerprint Sensor: 5/5. Its fast. Really fast and accurate. You can configure it to open apps using 3rd party apps.

3. Screen: 5/5. AMOLED screen is awesome. And color reproduction details of 1080p YouTube are lovely to an average user. Samsung says that its Gorilla Glass 3. However the current industry standard is Gorilla Glass 5. At this price range, Samsung should have gone with ver 5.0 intead of using the old ver 3.0.

4. Battery: 4/5. Although Samsung says that its 6000mAh, you wont sense that its 6000. It looks and feels like somewhat around 5000mAh. Battery drains from 100% to 20% at the end of the day with data off when not in use. If you are a gamer then you will have to recharge the phone once every 4-5 hours of gaming. But for an average user, this phone has sufficient power to last through the whole day without needing to go to the charger. The charger supplied is a 15 Watt adapter with a USB Type C data cable. And it charges the phone slow. Charging 6000 mAh should take time, but this charger takes around 3.5-4 hours for a 100% charge.

5. Processor: 4/5. Samsung uses Exynos 96112.3Ghz Octa-core processor for this model. Its comparable to Snapdragon 660. Processor performs well while running games and editing photos.  Heavy gamers should however prefer to go to MediaTek's G series or Snapdragon 700 and 800 series processor phones to play at max game setting and configurations. Multitasking is smooth and fast. However, there is a noticeable delay and slowness when installing new apps and also after taking a 1 minute video in highest resolution. It feels as if an extra 5 seconds are needed while installing a new app and saving the video. Overall in the end, combined with 6 GB Ram, the processor a potent performance combination for all types of users.

6. Camera: 1.5/5. Very poor quality photos captured by a phone of 48 MP camera. It feels like 13 MP camera. The front camera also captures poor quality photos. Zoom is not supported. Close-up macro shots are horrible. If you are a photographer and love taking photos and camera is the top priority, then this phone is not for you. Camera software is also very poor. Since I rarely take photos and am interested only in gaming, so I am satisfied.

7. Connectivity: 5/5. No issues with connectivity. I am having 50 ms ping while playing and excellent call quality.
No issues here whatsoever.

8. Software: 3/5. Samsung is known for installing tons of bloatware in all their phones and this model is no exception. Had to spend close to 45 minutes to uninstall/disable all the unnecessary bloatware. OneUI 2.0 is actually good. Its smooth and offers smooth usage.

Final thoughts: If performance and battery is your priority, this phone will satisfy you and your requirements. Better buy this phone instead of Chinese phones.
However is photography and photos are a priority, then this phone should be at the bottom of your list.
Headphone is not included. You need to purchase it separately. Also buy a screen guard and a back cover. Phone heats up while playing online games. However the main reason is that the current room temperature is close to 40-42 degree Celsius. Heating should not be a problem for most users.

It is a good phone considering everything it offers, only dissapointment was not knowing about missing software features such as dex, edge lighting, and windows screen mirroring support from samsung for m series. Still an excellent product for daily use. Not recommended for gamers. People who are looking for a good built phone with excellent UI and and an awesome screen go for it.All the hardware works as expected no complaints there.

I bought two of these for my parents.

Pros:
1. Finger print reader and face unlock good features.
2. Screen is huge. Good for media consumption.
3. Audio is loud. Not the greatest but what can you expect from a mobile.
4. Fast enough.
5. USB C
6. Battery life - pretty good.

Cons:
1. The camera sucks. If you want to buy a phone and the camera is a main feature then skip this. One of the worst cameras I have ever seen in my life. Since my parents don't use the camera much, they're ok with the phone.
2. Unnecessary apps which cant be removed like FB, Netflix etc. Samsung store also cannot be uninstalled. Had many apps installed which I didn't want like Snapchat, Dailyhunt (what is it even), etc.

Thinking of buying this @12699 is partially good but not at all. If you want to buy a Samsung phone for this price it is better.Camera quality isn't so good as a 48MP camera should be, when you zoom your captured photos it'll not so clear as shown in ads. Front and rear camera has brightness but not very clear images are captured. Blur option is given which is also of no use.
Battery is as same as a 4500mah battery. Fast charging is partially helpful

Can someone help out in the time taken to charge the battery and as well the how many hours will it last on 1 charge ? As my phone has took around 4hr to get charged for 55% on the first charge.

I have been using this phone since 2 weeks.
Pros
1. Manufactured in India
2. Display is really good. I can surely distinguish this from my old phone
3. Battery life last more than a day even after high usage
4. Dolby atmos sound enhances video and audio experience
5. Camera is fantastic. Does a good job for a noob photographer like me
Cons
1. Charging wire could have been little longer
2. I miss led notification light
Over all Samsung has done a very good job in mid range segment. At this price I did not wanted to purchase some other brand with UI that is more like a adware

First of all, Thanks to Amazon for quick and timely delivery.. I have been using this phone samsung galaxy M21 for past 10 days.. features and specs you can check out on description page.. I will talk about how I felt about those features..

1) 6 gb ram nd 128 gb storage - phone is pretty fast and does not get slow even after opening so many apps.. memory management is nice.. 128 gb memory seems sufficient.. no problem in this area..

2) Display - display is very clear and crisp.. brightness is nice and screen can be visualised clearly in bright sunlight too..

3) call quality - HD calling support gives very clear voice but it also depends on the network signal..

4) Camera quality - nice camera for casual use.. I will give this camera 7 out of 10..

5) Fingerprint sensor and face unlock - this is an area where complaints can be found.. phone keeps on asking to cover the full sensor which some times gets annoying.. face unlock is slow.. and useless.. disappointed there..

6) Audio quality is good.

Overall an average phone for less than 15k budget

When the phone arrived 1st 2days are quite good and phone worked perfectly.  But after 2days it started showing sone battery problems and battery lasts only upto 3 to 4 hrs which not accepted with this phone and it's getting even worse now. And now Amazon is not responding to it . It seems like i lost my 13 thousand money.
  If any help provided it means alot to me coz i didn't expected this kind of trust issue with amazon.

Utterly disappointment from seller's sideüò§

I wanted a phone immediately so I bought this product 4 days back. I have never seen this kind of worst packing ever for a phone. The package was damaged. There was some minor scratches on the body and camera frame. I didn't mind it bcz if I return this product it might take two or three weeks to get a new one because of this lockdown.

Okay whatever it is, lets forget itüòî

In my 4 days experience,
I feel this is the best value for money phone in this price segment.
Battery is amazing it will last for 1.5 days after full charged. We get about 9.5 hrs aprox for normal usage.

Display quality is mind blowing
Camera is okay (its excellent when comparing with the other phones in this segment )

Fingerprint reader is faster enough.

Only i found a small problem with the display screen refresh rate. It could be improved, because the display might feel little laggy sometimes after changing it to dark mode.

Although it's an amazing affordable gadget.

In 2020, a brand like Samsung is making worst than Mi or Realme. In the same price You can get much better smart phone than this one or A SERIES or M SERIES.
Good-  Screen- super amoled display is really good.
 Battery- really performs great. 50% charge took for 8 hours of gaming. Oprimiser work really well to perform lagless use.
Processor- works fine.

Bad- (IMPORTANT) NERWORK RECEPTION- this phone is only made for indian sim card. Here except metro cities the mobile network mostly has issues. Internet peception is bad than MI and realme. Whatsapp videocall are slower than other phones in the same network, same location. Download speed is slower even.
CAMERA- REALLY WORST EXPERIENCE WITH CAMERA. Closer image doesnt take focus. 48 megapixcel is just fake.
Just do not waste your valuable money.

Steal the deal ..‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èI m a regular user i dont do gaming purchased this one to watch series and other content bcz of its display, so the Device is really good in this budget....display is awesome...no lagging issues or any other heating problems in day to day tasks or while charging.....takes around 2 hours to get charge fully from 20% only con is...camera and image processing could be more improved bcz it gives a whitish shade to skin tone and overall image lookes a bit whitish...so saturation need to be improved....otherwise its a great great device at this budgetüòä

* sAMOLED 6.4 is delivering high satisfaction
  Display is big, good, sharp, crisp and clear
  enough, Bright colours.  one of the top reason
  to go for M21
*Dolby atmos gives amplified audio output
* Battery is like ocean
* Camera is Crystal Crisp
* Fast enough
* Best in budget
* Video experience is just wow

But also know it

Body is plastic but glossy , looks good
The frame finishing does not give a luxurious feel. But a good cover can do that, anyways you will use a cover to protect it. So this reason should no stop you from getting M21.
But when you use It, overall performance is going to be satisfying.

 200 % recommend this mobile

I got this device yesterday.
Initial great impressions, sturdy phone a bit on the heavier edge because of the huge battery.
I am rating a perfect 5 for the amazon packing and service provided.
I am happy with the device, its pretty smooth with the new Samsung One UI, lot of great features and improvement on the older samsungs
This is the first time i have decided to buy a Samsung phone. I never bought them because i never liked Samsung's UI.
So overall happy but a 3 star rating for the device because of the defect inside one of the camera lens i don't know how that happened. But i am not happy seeing it. I know this is a low-budget phone. But i do not expect such carelessness from samsung. I know its a small thing and i can still take photos but i don't feel good that it's there.
I wanted this phone urgently, i have use for it. So i cannot even replace this phone because I need it. Once the lockdown is lifted i will have to visit the service center.

Such a good device. But a small thing that ruins the experience Samsung. I don't know how quality check misses this.

1.Display is Super No doubt about it.
2.Camera is good.
3.Battery is good enough but not that much good as per expectations from 6000mah battery.
4.No irritating adds like other chines smartphones
5.user interface is goood
6.Finger print sensor works well and fast
7.Battery drains fast  in PUBG game I dont if its common in all other spartphone.

And its manufactured in India (not all parts but as compared to other chines phones Samsung manufactures most of the parts in India) that is the reason I bought Samsung by paying little bit extra to samsung than chines phones.

I m writing review after 4 day uSe of this phone, Everything is amazing in this mobile phone of M21. It's suitable for professional use. Good look, design . Main teachers in build and installed are : good hands free talks, vice recording, fine operation, good quality camera , powerful battery . No heating problem reported. One should buy this make in India product.

Phone has heating issues, battery charge takes 2hrs:45mins to get full charge
 Camera not upto the mark though we have many camera features. Slim and good design, colour is good but cheap quality plastic back mayerial. I didnt like.  Processor compamy promises a powerful chipset. But while playing games, its quality is poor. Lags in Between. Its worst. I'd suggest you to go for realme 5pro in this price range. Overall out of 5 I'd rate 2.2 - 2.5

Worst product it takes so much time to charge
How can a person charge for al10 hrs to fully charge the battery.
Its insane and am not able to replace the item.
Amazon must be liable for this product.

Battery charging takes too much time and when opted for replace, so much of formalities by amazon. Highly disappointed of purchasing such a valuable item from Amazon. Only by technician check, and after his report, amazon decides whether the item should be replaced or not. No value for customer words. Very bad experience with amazon purchase.

Bought on May 12, here are some Cons:

1. Over Heating
The phone gets heated ,while playing pubg,charging,hotspot usage and some times while surfing or downloading over internet.

2.Slow motion and super Slomotion Issues
The slomotion video doesnot appear smooth,also it fluctuates like anything in Led Lights,on night.

3.Battery Draining is more .(Expected more time)

4.Quick ball (like MIUI) and ScreenRecorder was missing.

5.Double tap to sleep gesture could be more convenient,but was missing.

6.Internet speed meter was missing.

7.Screen Edge Lighting - More settings was Required.

pros.
display

Though we could not expect much in this range(Rs.15000), there are few issues which really make this phone useless.
Pros :
1) As usual super amoled display is good.
2) Battery backup is good.

Cons :
1) Though this mobile has got 6gb ram, my old mobile with 2gb ram is much better than this. To open mail, it is taking hell of time.
2) Speaker is the worst part of this mobile. A basic model phone will have a better speaker than this phone.
3) Phone is bit heavy. Probably because of battery size.

All i can say is mobiles with 4000-4500mah battery and 4gb ram would be a better choice than this mobile.

I am writing this review after one week of extensive use.
Until now, two mistakes I found. First, while on charging phone battery starting to decrease even if no game was playing and brightness level is also up to 30%.
Second, while we receive or make a call voice of other person not come to me. This error came many time to me and I think this is defect in mfg.
However both problem get solved when charge phone without use
 And make or receive call after reboot the phone.

However apart from these cons. Phone works perfectly. Gameing is also good. Best budget phone.

I am an avid samsung fan. My last 2 phones have all been samsung. And i knew samsung will be the chosen one for me. Is it because of the huge brand name? No. Is it because its the best in technological quality? Not entirely. Is it because i hate eating apples? Oh no no fruits are healthy but I'm not a fan of eating iphone, if thats what you mean. Is it because its from korea and I'm a kpop fan? Lmao you wish....
I choose samsung because of its consistent and convenient customer care service. The problems with phones will not be at the beginning when you start thumbing and glaring at it. Rather it will be when it starts emitting problems and you're too impatient to leave it at a service store for 5-7 days, jobless and tech-bereft at home. So yes, thats why i chose to get a samsung phone. Not because its the best of the best of the best in the whole wide world (There are much more better and more expensive phones within the samsung world itself...duhh). But because their customer service is better than others and is available anywhere conveniently.
But i do like the upgrade from 3500 to 6000 mah. And from 3/36 gb to 6/128gb memory( i used j6 for 2 years) I'm a basic user. I browse, type, read....sometimes play ML. So M21 at 15k is a good phone for me. And im glad i waited for a phone like this at the range i bought. So here's to my new journey with my new phone for another 2 years.

Review after 3 days only
I like the mobile. Mainly for media consumption.  Battery life is good.
Display is also very good.
Camera is not as expected.
Average gaming performance for 1-2.5 hour gaming.
Speaker is not that good when gaming. But for media it's normal and as expected in price range. But with Dolby atmos on earphones I think it's very good.
UI is very good.
But when seen all as a single package, very satisfied by the mobile.
Only problem I faced is auto brightness  not detect the brightness faster and decreases the brightness while landscape gaming as pubg.

So I bought this for my dad and was bit apprehensive about the phone before I bought it. My dad wanted to have a phone which is easy to use and has good battery backup. He gone through saveral phones on Amazon but he was not convinced by other brands. He selected this and asked me to make sure this is a good phone. I order this and am very glad that it turned out to be a great phone! (Otherwise I have been dead lol) He is very happy with the performance, easy UI, great battery backup and nice camera. Now my mom, my dad and myself, all use Samsung mobile.  I'll recommend this phone as an excellent budget phone packed with great features!

The fingerprint is a bit flimsy but works fine. The phone stutters with the 4 gb ram. It gets warm on the upper part of the screen. Not for power users. Suitable for parents with that massive battery. Microphone quality is good for calls. Samsung should better their build quality to compete with their Chinese counterparts. The samusung UI has nice quirks and features. The amoled panels outshines.

1. Battery :- 5/5
Good Battery performance.

2.Display:- 4.99/5
Display quality is excellent (Super amaload with full hd)

3.Design:4/5
Although It has a 6000 MAH battery bit still it is not bulky.
Slim phone but No glass body

4. Camera: 4.5/5

Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available.

5. OS&amp;UI:- 5/5

Android 10 with One UI

6.Finger print reader and face lock: - 3.5/5
Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast.

7.Processor and performance 4/5
Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers , But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer.
No lagging and no hanging till now. but still samsung can improve processor.

8. Charging : 4/5 for fast charging. Provided with a 15W charger and it takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone

9. Accessories : 2/5

No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.
So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic and more prone to scratches.

Conclusion :- In this price range, It's the best choice for a non gamer.

Reviewing it after using for more than 10 days. Samsung galaxy M21 is very handy and classic looking mobile and light weight as well even though having huge mah battery.Features like 48 MP excellent camera, super amoled display, and 6000 mah huge battery in this price range is considerable. Processor is also great ( You can Play PUBG, COD smoothly) though Snapdragon processor is obviously better than Exynos for games. I loved the display most. Fingerprint reader is fast no issues at all. Other supplimentry features are also useful, no ads like Redmi mobiles show. Camera is far better than other mobiles in this price range and most attractive features is 'Night Mode'. Battery life is more than one and half day to 2 days depending on uses. Only thing I didn't not like that with 6000mah battery Samsung giving 15 Watt charger, very strange thing. No other issues I noticed like lagging, heating etc.

So finally my conclusion is that if u are a normal user(not a gamer) and want a super amoled display, good camera, huge battery and good looking mobile then this is a perfect mobile for you in this price segment.

I have been using M21 for over a week and honestly it was the best decision !
Pros :
Best Battery life ,
 Camera quality ,
Awesome Super Amoled Display ,
Charging is quite fast even though it has15W fast charging.

Cons :
Not the best Face Unlock in this price.
Honestly, I didn't find much cons .

I got my M21 on 21M (21st May). Been using it since and it's been brilliant.
Pros:
Amazing display
Great cameras for day light and ample artificial light photos
Great battery (even though it isn't optimized yet, it's giving great backup)
Good RAM management
Feature packed

Cons:
Bad low light photos

All in all, a great phone at the price. Couldn't have asked for more.

Got my M21 6GB/128GB two days back.  Awesome phone.  Value for money.  Display is very good.  Touch screen awesome.  Camera also excellent, front and back.  Overall good buy.  Lots of preloaded apps are there.  The only thing I felt slightly bad is about the battery.  It does not feel like 6000 mah.  But don't know, let me use it for some more days.  Will come to know.  The charging cable is short.  Other wise a very good 15000 phone from Samsung.  Must go for it.

The phone stands true to its word. You cannot expect the performance it gives in price range of 13k. Camera quality is excellent at 48MP. Fingerprint reader is fast and it also has face unlock which works even in low light. And believe me these are perfect value for money. Battery last more than 1.5 days with moderate usage. The sAMOLED screen is excellent with accurate colors and a very smooth touch. It has many useful features one cannot count.I have both m31 and m21 at home. I ordered one phone before lockdown in march and impressed by the performance i ordered second phone now. I personally feel it better than any other phone in this price segment.

Great product by Samsung at lower prices. Few points to mention after using for a week.
1. Great super amoled display.
2. Smooth UI on Android 10 latest version.
3. Good camera with 20MP front. Camera experience is above average.
4. Slight heating near speaker grill when playing audio. Speaker quality is average.
5. Fast finger print sensor and face unlock.
6. Full Charging took 2.5hr at least.
7. Battery last for 2 days for normal use. Screen on time about 10hr on an average.
8. Good processor and RAM management.
9. It is not a gaming phone.
10. Use tampered glass and back cover to protect the phone. Not included in box, purchase separately.
11. Samsung brand value to consider.
12. Over all good phone capable of doing daily normal task. Marking: 8/10.

Samsung M21 is an amazing piece of accessory to be on hand while roam around . As it described, it is a monster with respect to battery.. Stared using for a week and charged 3 times even though I use my office email as well. To get the full battery charged, it takes almost 3 hours ..

The speed of the mobile /processor is excellent and no hanging.. Samsung Galaxy M21 smart phone has a Super AMOLED display which gives perfect viewing experience. The camera is with 48 MP and gives quality pics with many inbuilt options. Full screen option is amazing..

I am not a gamer and hence no comment on the gaming experience but hope it will not disappoint you.

At the end , I am sure ‚Ä¶ for a normal user, the options given at this price will make a smile on your face..

Amazing,Excellent but camera quality for video is not so attractive as I think when I am buying this.Android 10 and the most attractive as I like personal Samsung One UI 2.0 makes this phone more attractive.The fingerprint reader is very fast as unlocks the phone very fast.The battery life is too good as it runs 2 days without charge.It can take up to a 2-2.5 hrs to charge a battery from 0 to 100 as it is carried out by a fast charging by fast charger of 15 Watts.The gaming experience is also too  good in this phone compare to phones in this price range.Pubg also runs in high to medium settings,HDR.Pubg also runs in Ultra HD mode but lacks few times but in this range of phones it is like a flagship phone for gaming.Camera quality for photos is too good also i am sharing some pictures click by this phone but you have to compromise for video quality.Really this phone is eligible to grab the title "Value for Money.#Wattamonster#Wattashot.

Display (10/10): Awesome Super-amoled display which provides great viewing experience. Best in the market at this price point.

Battery life (10/10): Can easily last for 1.5-2 days even after moderate to heavy usage, also charges pretty fast (around 2 hrs) considering 6000 MW battery.

Speed (10/10): The UI is superb and I feel it is much better than other Chinese custom UIs. No unnecessary ads popped up,  unlike Realme or Xiaomi phones. Also, for regular usage I didn't see any lag. For high end games, not sure I am not a heavy gamer so serves my purpose. Fingerprint works smoothly every time, but face unlock doesn't and could have been better.

Camera (9/10): I feel the camera quality is again much better that other phones available in the market at this price point. It undoubtedly takes great photos during the day and even when there is adequate light around. However, the phone struggles to take great photos when there is low light, also no selfie flash. But again, no phone is perfect, so it's not a very big issue.

Build quality (9.5/10): Considering the massive battery, the phone is extremely lightweight. Thanks to the plastic back body of course. Also, overall build looks pretty decent at this price point.
No back cover or screeguard out of the box, so make sure you buy these along with the phone, as the plastic body is prone to scratches. Samsung could have added these accessories, like most of the other competitors.

Overall great purchase experience!!!! For watching videos, clicking photos and regular usage, this phone gives a very tough competition in the market. Highly recommended at Rs. 12,699/-, unless you sole purpose is gaming. Have to see whether it gets proper updates in the future. Samsung has a bad rep for that!

Firstly this phone comes with almost all the features you need in a phone . Im a teenager so i know . If you compare specs all the time you wont ever be able to decide but here the company name says a lot as indians have trust with samsung .

Pros : Good battery back up
Camera is up to mark specially night view and wide angle view
Having a big battery didnt felt like a heavy phone
Already comes with many inbuilt settings to play with
A faster chipset in this price range
Speaker sound is good more than what we expect
Dual apps available
Viewing angles are great as we get SUPER amolded screen

Cons : face lock is not up to mark
More charge time but i feel its worth it too
Being honest nothing more till now cause its been just few weeks

Overall i would recommend you to buy it . Valur for money :)

I loved this phone
This has pure samsung flaship level touchresponse.
Amoled display is amazing.
Battery is amazing.
And apart from all these
Look very expensive one in black color .
Camera is good .
Not heating .
Network reception is amazing .
Call quality is good .
Speaker is good.
Its like you hold jewel in your hand .
This fone doesnt looks like cheap smartphones like redmi xaomi and real me .
Build quality is amazing .
If you are not a gamer then go for it under 20k .
This is best smartphones and cheapest from samsung.
I have recently used realme xt but that one also not feels expensive in your hand .
In every aspect this fone is far above the chineese fones.
And UI is amazing like you will never get that feeling from any other chinees brand .
Amazing fone go for it
Think twice before going to choose chineese brand if u r not a gamer .
I loved it .

Battery backup is not as expected from 6000 Mah. Also charging  is very slow, taking almost 6 hours to full charged ( without  any use ). Also heating problem during  phone call and charging.

Indoor network is very poor as compared to my another mobile phone with same service provider.

I am very disappointed with this product from Samsung. Not acceptable..

Please return your product and refund me. So that I can buy a different mobile.

First of all  I would like to thank Amazon to deliver this product  earlier than delivery date.
About  pro:- (1) camera in day lite condition was great (below 15k range,better than redmi note 9 pro) but in low light it needs to be improved.
(2) Battery is awesome .It provides approximately 1.5days in normal use.
(3) Display  is awesome because it comes with super amoled panel , hence no other phone can beat in terms of quality below 15 I.
Cons(1) Charging is not great because it has 6000 monster battery  however it comes with only 15 watt Charger.Atleast it should have  provided 25 w Charging support.
(2) Processer is ok but not compare with snapdragon720 g or mediatek g 90 t but for everyday use it can handle all day activities except playing heavy games like pubg , asphalt 8 etc.
(3) Build quality  needs to be improved  .Its back panel  get scratches easily if you do not use back cover.

I got the 6GB, 128 GB version and have been very happy with my purchase. The face reader takes time but the finger print reader is spot on. The screen clarity is spot on and can read in bright sunlight without issues. The digital wellness is also well taken care with various options built into the software. Another good feature on the UI is the ability to turn down notifications to absolutely necessary apps, which is a big welcome. I am able to use one hand for  for navigation which is exceptional for a screen this size. Overall a good purchase very satisfied.

Hello guys
This is my review for Samsung galaxy m21.
I m an electronic engineer who better understands what technology actually means.

Now come to the point
What are the important key factors which everyone looks into a smartphone?

1. Design
2. Brand
3. Camera
4. Processor (performance)
5. Battery
6. Software
7. Price

This 6 factor are important factors which everyone keeps in mind before buying a smartphone.
Everyone has there own point of view that what factor is most important for them.
Now my first factor was the price so I was looking for a brand who can serve me better service in the mid-range price. We have many of the brands in the market to whom we can compare. I have searched many of the smartphone reviews and seen articles of the newly launched smartphone in the past 6 months and have seen large number of review.
I read a review that Samsung is improving quality as per need in the most buying segment mid-range smartphones. Samsung products are the long term use of products just because of there quality.

So here I start comparing all of the smartphone performance in terms of
1. Display
2. Camera
3. Battery
4. Price
5. Processor ( day to day usage )
6. User interface
7. Brand trustability

üëç"Here Samsung M21 wins "

I ordered Samsung M21 smartphone raven black with 6Gb ram and 128 Gb internal storage and i got it in 4 days in the lockdown situation.

I got the device in the box along with 15w type c charger, papers etc

I am using this phone for almost 5 days
Now, I become a fan of Samsung super amoled display you can compare it with any other mid-range smartphone display.
Processor performance with Samsung one ui 2 and super amoled display giving it a smooth and a premium feel.
Day to day performance of this mobile is awesome.
No doubt about the camera performance of the Samsung M21 smartphone, it click stunning pictures. Please do not waste your time in comparing camera samples of Samsung M21 smartphone with the other smartphones.
Battery performance is also good it can last for one and half day OR one full day depend upon your usage.
Charging speed is also good enough for me I wakeup in b/w 8 am to 10 am always seen battery remains 20 to 40 per-cent I put my mobile on charge once in the morning and get a full charge in 1 to 1 1/2 hour then I switch on my mobile data I use my mobile for a whole day in calling so many clients, using social media apps, watching movies and videos etc I go back to sleep in b/ w 12 am to 1 am then I switch off my mobile data.
I did not fully discharge my phone as per my usage so if you want to charge it from zero to a hundred maybe it would take 2 hours to charge.
Finger print sensor is also pretty responsive.
Now I am fully satisfied with the Samsung M21 mobile and using it without any restart of the phone.
Samsung is the south korean company presented in indian mobile market from so long yes it is a trustable brand.
In My opinion, you can buy it without any confusion.
Thank you

Awesome monster by Samsung. I love this piece with all superb features. With all great features, the following are the pros and cons of the device as I found out.
Pros:
1. Samsung Hardware Quality! Always exceptional. I remember using my Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300. I still have it and I can match the quality of M21 with that of S3. The price is also reasonable given the features. Could be a bit low.
2. Huge 6.4" Super Amoled screen with &gt;92% screen ratio and 1080x2340 pixels resolution is awesome. Colours and resolution is very good.
3. 48 MP camera comes with awesome features like slow motion, super slow motion, time lapse, portrait, food photography, night,  panorama, and pro mode. It also includes qr code scanner and bixby vision. Video quality is also awesome. Front selfie camera is also excellent with self capture features by palm gesture. Front camera is also used for face recognition for unlocking the phone, which is again an excellent feature. Tripke camera have wide mode, depth mode and normal mode.
4. Battery: 6000 mAH Lithium Polymer battery gives a monsterous backup. Even though, if you use all the features of the phone, the battery will stay for the whole day long. 15 Watt quick charging enables you to quick charge the phone and use it for the day long.
5. Processor, Storage and Ram: I've bought the 6GB 128GB version,  which has sufficient storage memory and RAM to copeup with your rigourous use, let it be games, videos or applications. The monster never slows down. Samsung Exynos 9611 Octacore processor is superb. Mali G72 MP3 GPU lets you play your favourite games with more fun!
6. Software: The Android 10 with One UI 2.0 is an excellent combination making the phone literally your virtual assistant. Samsung Galaxy apps are added advantages apart from the hardware quality!
7. Phone is light weight and slim, though long due to its screen size, bit its neccessary for a better viewing experience.
8. Loud speaker is good. Headphones support Dolby Atmos, and customizable sound profile to give you an amazing sound effect using headphones.
9. Other features include USB Type C, A-GPS with Glonass and BDS, Fingerprint sensor, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, dual 4G LTE standby (Good for Jio users!), Screen cast inbuilt and dual sim support with seperate memory card ecpansion slot with 512 GB card support.
10. Most important: Its Made in India! :)

Now the Cons:
1. Most needed these days is the NFC support for digital payments. Does not have NFC.
2. No Earphones in the box (Samsung provides one of the best headphones). Though @Samsung says that headphones are user specific, but still I would say headphones must be included, as they are one of the best.

In all, to summarize I would say that it is definitely a go for a great price of 15k for 6GB 128GB model. Great purchase with excellent features. I love my this monster..
 9.8/10.. Definitely go for it..

It is really a nice product. I have used many phones before, but this is a total package which has given features for every thing you think. Truly, a nice product under a relevant price.  The only thing I found after using it(although using it since 4 days only) is that it takes too much time to charge, battery support is 6000maH, which gives good backup, but it would be better with a 18watt charger.

Overall, the best product I have used so far.

Has been using for 11 days.....short time period but have sufficient knowledge.....

Has been using Redmi phones for long but decided to move away from Chinese products so turned toward Samsung....

Had a limited budget of 15k......and got this phone for 12699, well within budget but without compromising on
features. In fact got more features that expected.

Pros
1. Amazing display
2. Great Battery power - Very few phones have such large batteries of 6000 mah.
3. Good performance owing to good processor and 4 GM RAM.
4.  64 GM internal memory good enough for day to day use.
5. Great camera - very good pics in low light as well. Video quality is also good - 4K.
6. Separate slot for memory card in addition to dual sim slots.
7. All required security options including face recognition.

Cons
1.May be a bit heavy than my previous phone but got used to it after 4-5 days of usage.

Long term reliability however needs to be tested as this is a new phone, manufactured in March 2020. As
of now performing smoothly.

Overall very good phone with features of a costly phones at such a low price point.

No doubt the smartphone works like a charm, been using it for almost three weeks now and here are some pros and cons.
The screen clarity and resolution is exceptional, it's nowhere less than apple phones because Samsung manufactures displays for apple. So no compromise there, then the selling point of the phone is that massive 6000 mAh battery. In my daily use it gave me a full day plus some extra hours, I am a casual user playing pubg for 2-3 hrs, browsing a lot, media consumer and a photo enthusiast. And this phone really gives a very good battery life. The cameras are good, in broad day light and room lighting the picture quality is quite good. When it comes to low lights, it's a mess but manageable at this price point.
Talking about the cons I saw a few lags sometimes while closing apps, it's not a huge problem but shouldn't have happened. Another thing is the small charger that Samsung provided, it literally takes almost 3 hrs to charge.
Considering a normal user, Samsung has done its job. We have a beautiful smartphone with all the right features without any compromises.

Samsung M21 is a classy product with 6GB Ram and 128GB storage space at this affordable price range. Mobile can run without any lag or buffering. The special feature to be mentioned is it's long working battery. Once fully charged  ,it lasts for 2 days for me. Its 48 MB camera gives high clarity pictures almost similar to a DSLR. Selfie camera is simply superb and it offers new features like emojicons and super slowmos. Touchscreen is super responding. It can even get through rough uses by children. PUBG and Call of Duty can be run in ultra settings. It is accompanied by 18W fastcharger which can charge within 1 hour. The fingerprint sensor unlocks the mobile in no time. This is a best option available in this price.

6. Face Recognization is quite fast incomparison to previous versions of M series.
7.Fingerprint reader is also fast.
8. The one new thing samsung provides Bibxy Vision in M21.
Cons:
1. Samsung Should provide 18W or 22W charger.

Received the phone just today, I might change my review depending on my experience in the coming days!
On the first day, everything looks great! Battery charged to 100% in 2 hours and 45 minutes. Camera, Display, Performance all seem to be good so far!
Samsung tried to deliver the best value in this price range. For sure, you cannot compare this with a Rs.50000 or a 25000 Rs. phone; you get what you pay for.
Kudos to Samsung and Amazon! (Buyers, I have no stakes with either company, but this is truly a good product targetted on an average Indian user. Buy with confidence)!

Was in Delima between Redmi Note 8 4GB &amp; M21. Since I have Note 8 in the family already. All redmi/ Mi phones become expensive by 2-3k due to change in GST. My last phone broke in lockdown &amp; was in the market to buy new. I saw M21 &amp; compared it with Redmi note 8. Almost the same price point but Samsung got a new processor. Frankly speaking, coming from stock Android, I don't like MI user interface, too much Chinese &amp; customized. Samsung has a clean UI with minimal bloatware. And has 6000mah battery. So I purchased on Amazon. I thank Amazon for reducing delivery time to ease as Mobiles are a necessity. Good phone under 15k if you don't want Chinese/ complicated UI. Well, don't expect camera quality to be so high. But it's good for general use.
Pros
Great battery (6000mah)
Amoled screen
New processor
Wide-angle mode in-camera ( Average result)
Great price ( @ 12700/- when I purchased)
Polycarbonate body ( better than glass back as less wear &amp; tear more rugged)

Cons
Ram management ( too much ram consumption with just 4-5 external apps installed). No game installed yet.
Battery optimization is poor (with just 2 calls in a day, 3 hrs screen on time, some background apps) EOD battery 40% left.
Screen is big to handle with 1 hand &amp; super expensive if broke (around 9k)
Average camera. ( Too soft skin, more of digital filter)

Overall best phone under 15K if you can survive with pros more than cons.

Samsung M21 #whatta monster...Simply superb, its my 3rd Samsung phone. It is rivalry for its own brands such as M31, M30s, M30 for the aggressive pricing and same features.

Well my honest review after the use,
1. Battery is outstanding with 6000mah comes around 3 days life with normal use and charging takes around 2 hr 20 min to full charge.
2. 48MP camera is good but default camera settings 16:9 resolution pictures are better than 48mp pics, wide angle and bokeh affects are ok. Selfie camera is good as it feels like A71.
3. Phone have super slow motion, slow motion, night mode and hyperlapse options well thats good addition for the price range.
4. With good exynos processor no lag with using applications, its very smooth, games runs smoothly no lags at all.
5. It has video stabilization option by default and it has additional super study video option for better video recording.
6. Loudspeaker is ok ok may be after updates it can improve.
7. Automatic brightness control or virtual light sensor is not ok....some times under normal light it will be overbright and in dark somes times it works well but all the time u should manually fix the brightness, may be this area should be fixed.
8. No secure folder and kids home option.

Overall Android 10 with One UI 2, simply superb for the price range....simply go for it.

Phone is great and has many features but its exact copy of M30s with little edge over it. And the two things that give it an advantage over M30s is its selfie camera and default updated OS Android 10. Great phone to buy.  Only drawback,  it doesn't comes with any offer. You will get it at MRP.

I have purchased this phone during lockdown when delivery was started in Green zone and received it before expected time. Now I have used it for more than one week. I can assure everyone that you can't get a phone similar to this in this price because from 1st April 2020 gst has been increased on mobile phones even though Samsung has decreased its price.

Now how is it working?

It has huge 6000 mAh battery which is really huge. I am writing the review at 10 PM today with 40 % battery and I charged it yesterday 2 PM and I'm using it continuously.

It has 48 mega pixels camera but you can not get the same photo in other brands having 64 mega pixels camera.

No other brands have sAmoled display in this price so no one will have any doubt about its display.

Fingerprint sensor, face recognition is really faster than others.

These above-mentioned things are exceptional but it doesn't mean all other things are not good. It's over all a very good phone.

The only one thing is disappointing me is fast charger is not as fast as it should be, but I have no complaint because is has huge battery so it will take some time.

Thanks for reading.

I will comment on this phone after 10 days of usage .....let us talk about it point wise...

1) Display: Just flawless.....the crisp and contrast in the colours......if u wannna binge webseries and movies....Just go for it!

2) Fingerprint: it's NOT SUPER FAST but it's REALLY QUICK......

3) Performance: Awesome....not such lag observed .....okaay I am not a gamer....played pubg for abt 1 hr at a stretch......in HD and HIGH...it was infact the recommended graphics by default...
No such lag and smooth performance....

4) Camera: the back camera is decent.....but the front camera struggles to capture details....I must say if u apply the filters given to u by Samsung...IT IMPROVES THE DETAILS and gives u comparatively better pics than ORIGINAL mode......Hope Samsung fixes it through software update..

5) Battery: DECENT but not EXCELLENT...u will get backup somewhat more than 5000mah.

6)Value for money: it is value for money!!!!!!üòâU can go for it!!

Over-all build quality is good, camera as super.
Battery capacity is high but needs an optimization update, however it will work fine for more than 36 hours with normal usage.
Face detection is excellent.
Works Super smooth even after a week.

Gorilla glass 3 is there however gorilla glass 5 could have been used.
Screen quality is superb, auto brightness needs better adaptation.
You can find better usage of AI technology in this phone from audio adaptation to live transcription.

It is a perfect phone one can get in this price range, specially if you are seeking to not to buy a low quality Chinese phone.

Good performance. Some r saying bad processor but its a cheapest 9611 chip. Previously I was using Galaxy on5 pro so for me its a perfect smartphone. Planned to buy realme 6 pro but they increased price by 1000 rupees whereas M21 decreased price by 300 rupees. So for me its a value for money coz i saved 5000 rupees by avoiding chinese phone

Display and Camera perfomences are amazing for this  th rate.Any how the finger print feed back is a little slow compared to other phones of the same range.The phone provides you with some exclusive features.Power management is quite significant,it gives you with continues gaming for about 10 hr.It also provide a game booster service.For best experience of the specifications i prefer 6gb 128gb model.

This is my first Samsung mobile and I was a bit cautious while ordering it. But to my delight, everything i.e build quality, camera, battery seems to be just awesome. I have been using this mobile from last 15 days and have an amazing experience so far. Battery is something that distinguishes it from others and with an average use, my battery Lasts for 3 days. Moreover, it is manufactured in India.

Fingerprint reader is fast.üëçüèΩ
Camera quality is ok.
6000mAh Battery runs for a longer time on a single charge.üëçüèΩ
Company should supply a pre applied screen guard and a tpu case in the box.üëéüèΩ
You have to buy screen guard &amp; a protective case separately.
But Samsung Galaxy M31 is a better deal than M21.

It's  an amazing phone and works really awesome, an amazing camera quality where you can click crystal clear pictures. Talking about the storage data I don't think anyone has to even worry about that. I think this was the best phone under Rs.15,000 and it's  worth the cost too. And the best thing is that you have facial recognition which is just perfectly  fine and secure. Next comes to the battery life so I don't think there's any need to talk about this cause well the users must have very well known this by now and for the current purchasers  let me tell you that you will have long running phone battery so just don't worry and also you have great samsung apps in the phone already which to be honest helped me a lot. You even have very secure finger print reader feature and you will discover a lot more if you purchase this phone cause I feel my words won't be enough to describe this awesomely amazing phone.

1. Battery - I can give it 6 stars , battery is the best under 15k.
2. Display - The best display ( AMOLED is AMOLED , which is thousand time better than ips lcd) under 15k
3. Processor - Its good processor exynos 9611 (better than snapdragon 712) not as good as g90t or snapdragon 720 but above average for daily use (exynos is more power efficient than snapdragon and mediatek)
You can play pubg easily.
4. UI - One UI 2.0 is very very good, power efficient.
5. Camera - Its outstanding,  bettery than any phone under 15k.

Back pannel is of somewhat low quality.
Charging time is also more (90% in 2hrs, 100% in 2.5 hours).

Phone is compact. (Compared to redmi note 9, redmi is very very very large)
Go for it if you are confused between redmi note 9, realme 6 , galaxy m21.
Its better than galaxy m30s.

Best phone under 15k.

Well this phone is truly meant for all those who want a high performance phone for their daily purposes (not for heavy gaming).
  It has a very fast and accurate fingerprint sensor, an outstanding FHD+ AMOLED display, a very brilliant camera, with a nyc and decent EXYNOS 9611 processor which is known for its speed and of course a very impressive 6000mAh battery for 2 day's use.
  It can run the heavy games also as it has a brilliant processor but it's not meant for gaming.
  If u need a phone for decent gaming, extraordinary camera and an amazing display for movies and vdos, this is just for u.

Seriously I am the one who only use high end phones but the performance I got from this phone is too good. For battery it takes 2hrs approximate time to get fully charged but gives you more than 8hrs backup with 1-2 hrs pubg game play. About PUBG the phone provides very good performance and also doesn't heatup if someone says so. I am using this phone for a week know and it is very satisfying and up to the mark. About body you'll see that most of tha YouTuber says that it has boring looks and a plastic back but I don't agree with them. Yes it has plastic back but apart from that it looks Very good in hands. And about screen one thing there is no competition for Samsung when it comes to screen. For this much price you can't expect any more good phone than what Samsung gives. Don't hesitate if love this phone just buy it. Thanks

Fingerprint reader- Not even a second to unlock after your finger recognition
Face unlock -this too is best $ best one just a second after the click of home button and it will take you directly to the home screen
Battery Life-Absoultely it is 6000 MAH so no need to talk about its performance . I got my phone 29 percent charged and I used it continusly more than a hour and Still 5% was leftüòã
Camera quality is also good in this price range
And the loveliest thing about this phone is #LOOK_OF_THE_PHONE really...Its amazing phone
Go for it without any Doubts üëçüëç
Charger supports 15w fast charging..it takes a hour for 100% charge

It's amazing. The phone is really good and it never lags in everyday usage. There is screen  flash in front camera and along
with split screen it also  has pop up view for multitasking. The battery backup is amazing and the phone plays alot of games without lag like nova legacy and asphalt nitro and simcity. The charging time is adequate keeping in mind its massive 6000 mah battery. The camera is really amazing and bixby vision along with a r emoji are great features that I loved. One UI is the best and is completely ad free. There are no spammy notifications and the notification settings are pretty easy to handle. The dark mode is perfect and no words for the brilliant display quality üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç

This product is Awesome when i compared to the 'Samsung M40' because  M40 is not sAmoled.It has a better camera and i liked it very much.It has a good processor and i played the game PUBG with it and it is an awesome experience for me.It has a monster battery of 6000mAh and it is long lasting compared to my samsung A20 and samsung J8.Its fingerprint scanner is much better than my other devices.When i use camera it gives me a wonderful experience.It suprises me when i take slo-mo and super slow-mo videos.Its video quality is amazing its 4K video recording and super steady mode works much better than others.Its quality is better when i take selfies in my phone.The gaming experience of playing game is realy amazing.Its specs is cheaper to others at this range.Overall it is a amazing phone

Overall for 15k this phone is worth it (6gb ram variant), #DISPLAY: you WILL not find a better display at this price. #PERFORMANCE : (pubg wise), if you turn off optimisation and limit background processes to 1 at max(developer option), you get almost 3-4 hrs lag free 45-50fps gaming easily. #CAMERA : I feel the processor works too hard for camera quality (software wise) to compensate the low quality camera module (hardware).#BATTERY : awesome no doubt. #FINGERPRINT : way faster than in-display FR of upper mid spec phones. #ADVICE: Do not go for 4gb variant, 2 more gigs of ram (lpddr5) makes a lot of difference. #LOOKS: does it really matter? You're going to end up putting a cover on it anyways. Though, Its Ugly TBH.üòÖ and the phone is heavy like REALLY heavy. For me atleast!

Only couple I have with this phone.
1 they don't provide any cover, so your phone vulnerable to scratches.
2 they also does not provide any screen guard, again your phone is vulnerable to scratches.
Other than this the phone is of good quality. I didn't buy this phone for gaming purpose, but I played pubg (just to check) and despite of 4GB ram it is working great, even at HDR mode.
I bought this phone for my mom because of samsung name and it's UI, and it's UI is best, non sense add will not popup on your screen all the time.
Overall a great phone. Camera need an update ( update in terms of software.

Thanks to Amazon for delivering the Phone on time amidst the nation wide Lockdown.

Samsung has done brilliant job with Galaxy M21 smartphone from its Galaxy M series.
4GB RAM powered with Octa Core Processor gives good fast performance of Applications and Games.
Camera quality is great compared to all its competitors in this price range. Color reproduction of image and detailing are nice. Night Mode performance of Camera is good if not the best to capture photographs in lo light.
Super Amoled displays gives amazing screen viewing experience.

At this price range and the quality Samsung Galaxy M21 provides is definitely superior compared to its competitors.

Its makes Samsung Galaxy M21 absolutely a Best Buy !

Absolutely fantastic product! Loved it. The battery life is amazing and it charges 0-100% within 2 hours. Through continuous use the battery last full day which is great. I would say that camera is good but it didn't meet my expectations but I am not a camera person. Value is great. You can't find better product than this at this price. It has AR, AR Emoji, Night Mode, Super SloMo @240FPS.

Samsung M21, 6 GB, 128 GB RAM. EXYNOS 10 NM Processor, Samsung 48 MP main back camera. Most importantly Amoled display with AOD. No back cover in case. Good price. The brand is better for people who want to use it for long period. It will stay with you at least for 3 years. Don't fall for the 5G processors, 5G won't be there in India at affordable rates till 2025. It is better deal than Redmi, Vivo, Realme or Oppo. Fingerprint reader is superfast. If you like to watch videos, view pictures or read a book, it is better device than above brands upto price range of Rs.35k.

Thanks to amazon for one day before delivery
And coming to the phone it's a 6gb and 128 gb variant which is pretty good but back panel of the phone at it's end shown lite scratches after it's unboxing.Black color looks very good and camera front quality is good,48mp cam is not worthy but good.Display is very good,But I truly dissatisfied about the battery of the phone it's working is like 4500mah battery,I expected a lot from 6000mah battery. No hanging problem was found in it and also I am not a gamer for making the Ram suffer üòâIt is a family oriented mobile perfectly suits for home usage or women usage.

Purchased the phone on 18th May and the quality of phone is way above the price range. The touch screen is as good as any top range phone. The processing speed is good enough to play any games. The best feature is wifi calling as I have poor indore mobile network but due to wifi calling I am able to make phone calls without having to go out.

After doing an intensive research around my budget finally decided to go for M21.
First impression were super. It looked classy and neat camera bump at the back is flattened out precisely.(As there have been lots of talk about its aesthetics to other phones in this price segments)
Display is just perfect for media consumption best in class and its budget.
UI is optimized perfectly although there are lots of pre installed apps which you can uninstall as per convenience.
Samsung is doing a great job in budget phones.

The phone is the best one I have ever used.
I love  the tri cameras (48mp,8mp5mp) , I love the display(super amoled), I love the battery life span (6000mah), I love the charging speed(15watt fast charger) , I love all the security features(supre fast face unlock and finger print sensers) , I love the simplicity of design of this monster , I love the super cool features. It's midnight blue variant is adorable. In this price range (INR.12699) this mobile phone is the bestest one . Android version 10 is my dreame feature and this mobile satisfies my all the needs and requirements, and this faves me more and more than my wants . I really loved the super cool üëåüëåüëåüòçüëå‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëåüëåüòçüëåüëåüòé‚ù§Ô∏è üòé smartphone. That's all.

At price of 12,700 , super amoled display and 6000 mAh battery are highlights of this phone.

Battery : 10/10
Display  : 10/10
Camera  : 8.5/10
Perfomance (other than gaming) : 8.5/10

I preferred  M21 over others in the same price segment because of display and battery  with thag you get good camera quality too.

Worst battery , does not even lasts for a day on medium use .
This 6000mAh is a fraud.

M30 was much better than this in every way.
BAD DEAL

One of the best midrange phones in the market as of now and it couldn't get better. It's been a great experience buying this smartphone. I haven't seen these many features in this price range. Camera is top notch. I would recommend this one over any other smartphone as I had done extensive research before buying this phone and I am completely satisfied with the product. Battery life is fantastic. It will last for at least a day and a half with extreme usage. Built quality  is also nice and it feels like an extension  of yourself. Fingerprint reader works as flash and its lightning fast. To summarize my review,  it's a great phone and I recommend everyone to buy it. Thank you Samsung

Very good mobile.
Battery life is extraordinary. For a normal user you can simply get two days.
screen is stunning as usual.
Mobile is good to handle in the palm.
Front Camera is very good.
Back camera should have been improved little.
Overall if you are not a gamer, the mobile is a decent purchase in this price range.

Amazing phone by Samsung. A very great device at a nice price. I would have surely rated it above 5stars if it was possible.
The battery is literally a monster.. I have used this phone from 95% - 20% for 48 hours. The camera is awesome and biometrics are quicker then thought of.
Overall.... A must buy option if you are looking for a new beasttt.....

Here comes Samsung galaxy M21 it's the best in class, premium design look Its actually a real monster in performance, camera quality is good, battery really stay for longer time in frequent usage, and fingerprint sensor is very fast. Exynos 9611 octa core processor it's very fast, does not hangs at all. Samsung is a good brand globally No.1, maintaining standard products, good quality, and economical price. Iam actually reviewing this after using for a week and i highly recommend this product for everyone, don't look for negative reviews just go for it you will be happy by using the product.

It is a 'saying' that, "First impression is the last impression."
It happened with me. Once in my childhood my neighbor bought one of samsung phone and nearly after 3 or 4 months that phone starts hanging. After that the impression of Samsung company on me was worse. But, now I have bought this phone after seeing its battery, display and ram and ofcourse its clock speed and processor I become the fan of this company and especially of this phone.
It impressed me very much and the above idiom became wrong for me.
And if you're going to buy any phone,Then I, personally recommend you to buy this incredible mobile.ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥

Please  don't buy .I have purchased  6GB ram and 128rom due to amelood  screen and battery.before this Samsung  I was using mi product.trust me MI products  are far better  than Samsung. Just because  of current  seniario  I thought  we should  leave chininese products. But I'm regretting MI features  and mobile are far better.dont watch you tube channel for mobile selection all are making us fool there is minor differences  between  amoled and ips full HD screen. And avoid  Amazon  shopping  flipkart is good for electronics  and mobile  purchases. Customers supp won't help

Best budget phone.... Strongly recommended phone.
The best to choose Samsung M21 among the all available choices in this range. I am using it for the past 3 days and I am fully impressed with all the features. The camera quality and battery life are excellent. Fingerprint reader is very fast. Elegant design and wonderful display. The user interface is also very good.

I strongly recommend this phone for purchasing. Samsung M21 is the best value for money in India. I am full satisfied with the purchase of this phone.

Thank You Samsung &amp; Amazon for your wonderful product &amp; Delivery.

Face lock is not working properly, batter life is good but takes 4-5 hours for full charge,
Low light images are of poor quality and most disappointing thing is that it doesn't have applock and if you download S secure from galaxy store than it won't even notify for new messages if you lock that application with S secure.

It's a good good product manufactured in  Indian . After log time Samsung launch a good looking cool product.
It's a worth of money to buy it.
I am giving 4star bcoz Charing is not fast as they are claiming.
Camera is good, in low light good images can be captured.
Processor is fast enough for most of heavy application.
It's a bit heavier in weight.
But stronger than mi and other. As Samsung usually take care . Thanks for design engineer of Samsung to provide a quality product with budget friendly.

I strongly recommend it.

Camera 2 API not supported as it's a exynos based device. One ui gives a premium feel great screen and battery. Best value for money. Takes lot of time to charge but even after 2 matches of pubg consumes only 2-3% battery. I hope Samsung provides features like edge lighting and edge panel in M series too. It's a software thing anyways.

A very nice model Samsung M21 from Samsung India. I have chosen this model among other models with similar specifications but others were not trustworthy. The camera quality, battery life, usage and handling, finger print reader and security feature are nice. Finger print sensor taken some time to recognize for 2 to 3 days use. Later it is smoothly working. Battery is mindblowing n can be used for 1.5 days on single full charge. Camera is also best. Sturdy 180 gms, handling is not a problem.

The Samsung Galaxy M21 is simply an awesome phone that deserves all the praise it gets.

Pros- Camera, Display, Battery, Build Quality(Despite having a plastic back)

Cons- Location of the speaker, Samsung bloatware

OVERALL - Go for it blindly if you want a budget phone with a great camera, outstanding battery life, and an amazing display. Also, the black variant feels premium to the touch.

P.S - Keep in mind though that this was made for an average consumer and not heavy gamers. However, it can pull off any game you through at it with ease.

First of all I have to say the phone I received is not upto full charge and when Pressed power button it was is recovery screen.which means some one used that phone for a while then returned it...I am paying this 12,699/- amount for a brand new. phone not a used one. The battery charge was at 52%. I have never seen any phone which is not less than 95 percent before unboxing it.......If you guys providing these goods to customer please check it first before packing ...but I am happy with the product because my father is happy .as it is given to him for his b'day..... ...Thank you

Over all it's so good and handy
It's super amoled screen and long life 6000mah battery performance is highlight in this SAMSUNG M21.
And it's camera performance is also so good.
If ur budget is 13000 this the best one
It is sooo light weight.
It's packing is also soooo good and delivered before time.
It's fingerprint sensor and face lock also good but not fastest (finger print)
It's having good fast charge but not fastest but it's good.
Finally the design is also good .
Thank u AMAZON,SAMSUNG
  I expect this is helpful to you üòä

Best samsung mobile in budjet price range..
Camera is nice, selfi is amaizing portraits is good..
Battery charging time is large (2.30h) it stands for 2 to 3 days..
But there is some heating problem whill charging and continous usage...
Fingerprints much faster than face unlock...
Many of samsung appps are installed before using it....
I am saying that the best phone of samsung in this price range...
The main problem is no headphone and case in this box...
The mobile is smoth and nohanging till my review...
I really like it.......

I have been using this phone for almost a week now. The phone has great battery life as expected. I don't click photographs so the camera is alright for me. The earphone jack and speakers could have been placed better because they giving me trouble while playing games. The fingerprint reader doesn't register my whole fingertip so it gives me trouble unlocking the phone from certain angles. The charger given along this phone doesn't really "fast charge" though it might be a problem of my power socket. Don't have any other complaints so far, the phone is working just fine.

Bought this phone a month back. This is my first Samsung phone(normally I prefer xiaomi).So far so good. I loved the look and feel and have taken pictures and videos. Looks fairly good. If you are planning a phone within price13k it is a good option. Battery lasts for 2 full days after a full charge even after extensive use of hotspot. One problem that I noticed is sometimes ( only once or twice it has occurred ) the sim is not detected, but that gets automatically fixed on restarting  the phone. On the whole, a product worth it's price.

Yes, it's worth buying Samsung M21 . The Samsung m21 is built for media consumptions. It's a feast to watch videos on that device as it has amoled panel and words are not enough to say that, you should experience it personally. It has insane battery life. You need not charge m21 for 2 days if you are an average user BEST . The best part of the phone is camera yes camera outstanding  performance  you can capture everything  in real frame I loved it ,even selfie camera gives you good performance  .
So, its worth buying Samsung m21...realmonsta in Samsung family

I am a former oneplus3t user, after using this device I am very happy with the overall experience.
The USP of this device are :
1.Super_amoled f-HD display (very bright colours üòç), gives u flagship experience.
2.Big 6000mah battery.
3.Good camera.
4.Last but not least Samsung's one ui, its actually good ui with loads of features.

The only thing I don't like about this device is 15w fast charging, this takes slightly more time to get the big battery charger.

Overall I loved the device, as it's super value for money.

days. I got to notice that i had to charge it on daily basis even in below normal usage, initially i ignored it but it is persisted which compelled me give 2 star and write this review. I dont know what is wrong with my handset , I try to contact samsung cutomer care but due to lockdown they r not responding.... may be I had got defected one... otherwise all the fratures in these phone is really worth at this price range, If I haven't had faced battery issue i definitely given 5 star....

It is quiet impressive to have a 6000mah battery at such a price segment with a good 15W charger. The inbox charger takes almost 2 hr and 30 mins to fully charge the phone which is the only cons. If the charging capacity was improved to charge such a monster battery, the phone could have been unbeatable. But still it is a better option than those Chinese phones. The one UI experience+SAmoled+6000mah is like having a pancake with extra butter and honey. It's all new next level. And after all, the best part of a Samsung product is their after sales service.

First of all phone is very light in weight although having 6000 mah large battery. Phone looks very premium. Looks and finish is very good. Display is very bright nd colors are so real. Both cameras are awesome. Interface is also very smooth like every samsung phone. Battery backup is superb full day video playback ability. Charging is very quick. All of the above it's make in india. So must go with it.

As mentioned by samsung this phone is totally a monster. Super battery life that easily lasts 2 days, it has an excellent camera which is better than what we get in most budget phones. The processor is also quite fast. The only thing that I don't like is the charging time, it normally take around 2.5-3.5 hours to completely charge from 0-100. Samsung should provide support for more than 15watts fast charge for the massive battery of this phone.
To a conclusion, the phone is awesome you'll fall in love with it

Fingerprint scanner
  Very good because if you unintentionally touch the scanner it doesn't unlocks rather a small force is required which helps while taking phone out of pocket

Camera
  Although you get a bit lower MP camera in this price range in India but Samsung's various camera features like focus and quick analysis of type of photo taken, helps to take nice pics. Stability in the video is also amazing

Battery life
Well when you have such a high MAh battery from Samsung you can have no question at all

Great product in this budget range. I used this phone from past 6 days. I'm a moderate user.

Battery  life : 1 day 6 hrs  ,  but  charging speed is petty slow for this monster battery.
Charging time: 2 hrs 25 mins (0 to 100%) approx

Camera: image processing is suprising in this budget range.

Fingerprint scanner: it's not quick enough because of it's animation.  And for accuracy,  I'll give 3 star out of 5.

For day to day life , it's a good with Samsung branding.

I love the samsung ecosystem and big fan of ONEUI. This phone is what Samsung  promised  us a monster . Lens are amazing and the shots have beautiful color capture.  The sAmoled display give u a smooth experience  to ur eyes as well as saves battery. With 6000mAh battery im using it for alomst 18+ hours  without charge which is an essential  feature for me. The phone is bit heavy for me but prolly not for u just  188g. The touch is smooth and fingerprint works blazing fast. I would have loved it more if Samsung ship it with designer backs.

Great package you should buy it
camera display and battery really perform well
And for an 12699 rs. Its a great deal but only disappointing that company does not offer backcase in box. So u should spend more bucks to buy but after all its great u get excellent Ui and ram management.
And I does not found so issue with its polycarbobate back its quiet decent for all types of hands (small,big) it is so light to handle  .
And in hands it quiet interesting
Deffinately u can buy .. U get great package in under 13 k...

It is definitely a good device which you can opt for this price range. Especially the 6000 mah battery and AMOLED display makes this phone worth. The only issue I noted is with the charging time which is almost 2.4 hrs, but considering the backup, its still negligible.
I felt like face ID reads a lil slower in low light and finger print scanner works better.

Totally, the device is worth for the price of 12,699
(N.B: I am not a gamer so not tried that part)

Writin a review after a week of usage.
Amazon delivers this product a day before from scheduled delivery.
Feels a bit heavy when you hold this phone for longer duration.
Face detection not accurate all times.
Camera quality is above average+
Long battery life..i charged my phone after 48 hours of moderate usage.
Sound and video quality is good....sound feels slightly slower side.
Gamings: not prone to games so can comment.
Overall an above average phone.

I'm giving  1 star because  of poor battery  backup. Maybe  my Mobile have  this issue. I asked for replacement Amazon but very bad response.  Very bad experience in Amazon  first time. I'm not fool to ask replacement  unless  there is an issue.  The customer  care is not at all listening. Flip kart is far better than Amazon.

M21 is the best handset for me because its battery life is going 2 days on internet. Fingerprint sensor is excellent and also Face unlock  (also best experience in night). 48mp main camera is awesome clicking pictures in night also best. Handset gripping is nice. I am playing PUBG 4 hour continues but phone didn't heat. Screen experience is better than others phones. Blue colour is good looking. Charging is perfect with 15 watt charger. it's take about 2.5 hour to fully charged. I appreciate to SAMSUNG for his excellent work.

The best part of this device is the display.. Really vibrant and punchy colours with a lot of options for further configuration. Battery life is good. Charging time is also okay. Camera performance in daylight is really impressive, average at night. Cpu performance is okay but not great for heavy usage. This phone is more dedicated for entertainment purposes like videos, movies, web series etc.
Only downside is the retro style plastic backpanel. Samsung should definitely look at this matter.

Samsung Galaxy M21 is a worthy phone with great features loaded. Especially battery this really drives to run atleast 2-3 days.

Also this device is light weight and fits to pocket smoothly. Especially i like the OneUI of samsung which delivers the professional version of android OS.

Photo quality is the another highlight of the samsung m21 this is really great.

I love this device. Before i was using Mi now i switched to samsung now i am experiencing the professional Experience in mobility.

Samsung M21 is an extremely good phone in this budget. Camera quality is very good with bright and colourful photos. Enhancement to the photo quality through triple camera and a powerful front camera enhances user delight. Touchscreen is also very smooth and has high quality feel. Processing speed is fast and screens are easy to navigate, a typical Samsung advantage. Strongly recommended for anyone looking for a 6GB RAM phone in this price. Very satisfied!

Awesome mobile in every Corner. I suggest go for M21 best battery backup, best camera quality, I am also using MI note 8 pro but mi is the worse mobile because camera 64 MP but quality like 2 mp display is also worse, video recording worse over and all Samsung is the best Mobile. It is my open challenge Samsung is not compare any Chinese mobile.

The phone is just amazing!!
If you are not a gamer and like to binge watch then go for it. No better option at this price point
1.The display is flagship level.colours are punchy and blacks are just elegant.
2. Battery life blew my mind. I watched a 2 hour movie and battery dropped just 6%.
3.camera is also top notch. There is enough detailing and post processing is also good.
I was confused between realme 6 and m21 and i am happy i went with m21. Worth every penny.üòçüòç

Good looking. Good camera. Overall a branded mobile. But sometimes there is disturbance /Problem in network. I found the Signal reception power is low in comparison with other mobiles in somewhere. It also I believe that the network problem may be rectified by updating the software as it is Samsung. Overall Samsung is Samsung. üëç

Samsung M21 comes with Amoled display with Full HD resolution. The mobile was very lighter in weight though it has 6000mah battery capacity. Good Battery life.
Always on Display.

Cons:
Position of the volume button was too High.
It takes more time for full charging

It's a pretty phone in this medium budget segment. I can say it's a value for money. The camera quality is awesome both front and rear but one thing, the upper part of the body at the back along with the face of camera at the rear becoming hot after taking few shots.
The sound quality is good and it is awesome if played in Bluetooth headset. Have multiple features and very easy to use and have a nice grip if you put a back cover.
Overall good but the camera is becoming hot.

Best product at this price better than any other phone. Made last moment decision to by this phone and hurray I was correct loved this mobile. I has some best features such as all apps can be converted in to dark mode in just one click and fingurescanner can be used to drag the notification bar which is best for me. Thanks samsung for making such product with long lasting battery life. And best part is it is made in India.

I liked this new phone from Samsung. Battery life is amazing. Just the charging capacity needed to be much more than 15W because it takes too much time to charge 6000mAh battery. The touch and feel of the phone is very good. Camera is amazing. The fingerprint scanner at the back is a bit of problem. My earlier phone had it in the front so it was easy to unlock without lifting the phone. But because this phone has it in the back it needs lifting. Overall a good phone.

In this price range we will get many other brands phones especially chinese phones with more features. But i love samsung because samsung is a brand.not chinese. SAMSUNG IS ALWAYS SAMSUNG.Good product.. i like this phone very much. There are many good features  in this mobile... m21 is very similar to m30s.. both phones are same in look and features. The front camera of m30s is 16 mp and m21 have 20 mp.
U MUST BUY THIS PRODUCT... u will like it.

The phone doesn't even turned on and It's not getting charged also. Unfortunately there is no return or refund policy for this. If you want to return this item you have to install one smartchek app and diagnose the issue, otherwise Amazon will arrange an inspection service at your delivery address and you'll get a replacement only if the technician is convinced. Amazon is simply cheating it's customers. Never expected this kind of discourteous service from Amazon.

The Galaxy M21 has a crisp 6.4-inch AMOLED display, It is powered by the Exynos 9611 SoC and i purchased 6GB+128GB handset which is not that much costly as compared to others handsets,It packs in a monstrous 6,000mAh battery which is it's best feature!! Camera is also great in short a phone with all features and that to at such an affordable price!! Loved it and what's more it is manufactured in our own country india!!

You cannot find a better camera, screen and battery in this price range. The processor might not be the best but I have used it for about 10 days now and the performance is good enough. The 6gb of ram is able to handle multi taksing easily. I am able to use split screen to listen to music alongside maybe fb or twitter without any issues. Playing pubg and CoD is also quite smooth. So overall, it is a nice device for just 15,000 rupees with everything one needs.

Friends, Samsung has now understood the people of India and have known all their demands that the consumer of India wants what. And what he sees when taking a new device. That‚Äôs why Samsung started working on the new Samsung Galaxy [M10, M20, M30] series and stopped its J series. And soon will launch the M series. This phone was made entirely by keeping the Indian consumer in mind, or it would not be wrong to say that this phone was made for the Indians only.

super amoled display, compact screen size, very good cameras and a 6000 mah battery is just awesome at this price. screen experience is top .bright and vivid colors,
when it comes to camera well it is very good under good lighting conditions. low light and night mode is also exceptable with this price.
overall cameras are very good. great exposure and dynamic range , supports EIS ,
battery is well it 6000 mah. overall complete package.

Even after having 6000mah battery, the battery backup is very pathetic..even without gaming, videos playback phone didn't last one day.
One UI of Samsung on this device is utterly rubbish...disabled maximum possible Samsung bloatware anf without opening any other apps, the Ram available is just 1.2GB. Doing multitasking phone lags and freezes eventually.

Really poor because of Samsung addons

I quite researched about this product and find this best under 15k
1.Best Screen Quality
2. Audio quality through speakers and headphone (Dolby Atmos) are just perfect.
3. The battery is just awesome from full charging I got 18 hrs with moderate usage and AOD
4. The camera quality is best in live focus and and the software of  main camera need improvement little bit
5. And one UI minor freezes rarely
Overall -4.75/5üëç

Pros-Very good battery life and awesome display.
Battery will last for a whole day with heavy usage. Low SAR value makes the phone much safer than others.
Cons-charging of phone takes nealy 3hrs. Because of low SAR value,wifi connectectivity from longer distance will be an issue.

Strongly recommended for those need more battery life,very good display and low radiation level is the main priority as I am.

This is a great smartphone with awesome features. The best part is the battery. I have been using this phone for about a week and there's not a slightest problem with the battery. The 15W charger works better than I thought and is fast enough. Camera is great. 48 Mega Pixels works awesome and the Ultrawide Sensor just astonished me, it captures a lot. At this price range, I think that this Smartphone is the BEST BUY.

overall it was an average buy product because of battery life. it seems that it has only 4000 MaH battery usually drained out within 36 hours with below regular usage .
fast charging  also is just a name with this product it took 4 hours to charge the product full.
camera result was fair . its not 41mp as its written in description of product.
phone weight is bit heavy.
not so happy with product

Best Samsung Phone at this rate
Galaxy  M21 is a another blockbuster mobile phone by Samsung.
As no one offers us 6000 mah battery it is the first important feature of this mobile phone.
Also it's look very good at this price and very nice phone to  buy.
It very smooth to use and handle.
Camera can be improved but very good at this price.
All over 9/10 points by me.
  Thanks a lot "Amazon" &amp; "Samsung"

Best phone in this segment. Massive battery, amoled display, light weight , good camera. Where as other brands are giving IPS LCD display, Samsung is giving  super Amoled displays. Go for it except those who want to buy phone only for PUBG or any other high end games .

Everything in this smartphone is good. It is my first time buying a Samsung Phone after all. It's good and all but there are some restrictions in this phone also, like you can't access the full system specification on any third party apps. If you want a phone that can give you 10+ hour screen time usage then buy this. Also the Amoled display is good too but not HDR10 supported. You can play it though but can't tell the difference.

This phone is just amazing, whether it's camera, battery, fast charging (18 W). But one thing samsung needs to change immediately in mid range phones is processor, in means that since long time they are using Exynos 9611 &amp; seriously needs to change..

But I must appreciate service of Amazon, it's just marvellous. Just fan of service - I'll give 6 star out of 5...

This is an amazing phone... if you need some highly powerful in terms of gaming, battery life as well as camera you undoubtedly can go through this product... I am reviewing this after 10 day of use and believe me.. it is truly a monster.. fingerprint sensor,  face unlock are doing great job... and the camera is just class apart.and the battery is so powerful that a whole day pubg will run only 50% of it ... it's just amazing

Best from Samsung at this budget , the AI in phones camera is the best thing of all.
And the display is awesome as always by Samsung.
The Processor is good for multitasking.
Games like pubg and COD work OK.
Battery is awesome , 18 W charger is good but more was expected.
Fingerprint is good enough...
Overall at this budget you can't expect anything more from Samsung so a great value for moneyüëç.

This is a great phone in every aspects, the price, the main cam in daylight, massive battery backup, smooth UI. It has ok signal reception.. not low nor high. But there are some features that are exclusive for M31 considering these both have the same CPU and everything aside from main cam. M21 is way better than those Chinese redmi phones which gives you better performance at the cost of bad user experience and quality.

Did a lot of research among other Chinese options but now having used this for last few days, no doubt that this is the best mobile in this price range with awesome display, battery and build quality alongwith the reliability of "Made in India"  Samsung brand.

I switch from apple 6 and believe me the screen and battery life is awesome in this budget phone. Must recommend phone. 64 GB is also enough for non gaming users like me.

It's a very good phone but for everyday user. It's great to watch videos in the amoled screen. The camera quality is good but sometimes the colours came out very punchy which is annoying ( thinks Samsung should put an update about this). But if you are s pubg lover just ignore the whole samsung M series. But for a normal user it's an affordable buy in this price segment.

The phone is really good for the price. The camera is good, the fingerprint sensor is a lot better (faster and more accurate) than my old Galaxy S8 and the display is really superb!

Two things I feel aren‚Äôt that well:
1. Auto-brightness sensor is not well calibrated
2. Battery capacity is good but the system is not well optimised which leads to higher battery drain

Camera pixels are of high resolution the pic. is clear and doesn't differ even after zooming.

The phone is mind blowing the battery backup is easily for 2 days in single charge the fast charging is too good
The screen experience is so smooth with super amoled screen
Camera is fantastic the quality of camera with 4k recording the picture quality is so good in zooming the picture you can easily see little thing also
There is no competition of samsung m21 in this price point

Screen- crystal clear and very smooth.

Battery backup-Exceptionally good. Once full you can use it for the whole day with heavy usage.

Camera-Very good picture quality.  sharp and clear images.

Looks- very beautiful phone. Blue colour is very beautiful.

Drawback is that it is very slippery and slightly  larger for comfortable operation with one hand.

Really "What A Monster" from Samsung. Best phone from Samsung in 14999. 6gb ram makes it a super phone and 128gb storage gives us a lot of space to download and save big games and movies.The processor is also good.  The camera quality is very nice.The finger print sensor is also fast and battery is like a powerhouse lot of backup. The phone is very good just go and buy it.

Received the phone quite well before date given the current lockdown situation. M21 is an excellent budget phone with right set of features. Build quality is durable. Starting the phone was quite easy was not happy seeing some third party apps. It's been priced good for blue color but I think the black model is not priced adequately. Over all good phone.

Excellent  phone in this renge, battery  backup is extraordinary,  camera is superb  specially a selfie camera, look is simple,  little bit heavy in weight...
One drawback  is battery  charging  very slow, it takes near about  5 hours to complete  100% charge when mobile  is off

I will recommend this phone to all those who want it for office use i.e. calling , hotspot , images etc.
But if you want a mobile for gaming I won't recommend this phone to you.
1 star I have deducted for heating issue and plastic back scratch issue.
And reasons to recommend this mobile
1. Screen
2. Battery

The monster has a long lasting battery. It can easily last for more than a day when used extensively!! Some people might find the fingerprint sensor a little higher for comfort but it works smoothly.
Camera is pretty good for this price and captures masterpieces in daylight.
Phone has super amoled display and all applications run smooth with 6gb ram.

Network connection efficiency is not so good. Inside a house full tower is not obtained. Probably the 'Gain' is low. So I am in doubt whether the set is defective or not. Pls ensure me. It has taken 7minutes to upload a game  of 6.79 mb.

I have used this product for past 3 day, from that experience I will say.This phone is really a monster interms of battery,camera and display.

The processor is also good . There was no hanging situation till date.

Am a heavy mobile user ,even for me the battery stays for 1.5 days , so it's for Shure that for a normal user it will last for 2 days

Awesome battery life....lasts for almost two days .... storage is also great at this price range .... Camera is fabulous with 48mp back camera .... Only one drawback is its large size .... Fingerprint reader is also great ... Triple rear camera is cool .... It offers 6gb ram also .... If u are planning to buy a phone at this price range it's definitely worth it ....

Phone is awesome in that price segment
I purchased at 12699 rs and i have not got any problem. camera quality is awesome. Before using this i was using mi a3 but mi a3 is not good and also its price is 12999

I personally recommend to all my friends if ur budget is balance then u does not need to search any mobile. Simply close ur eyes and bought this

Excellent phone under 15k range. The best quality i found is the battery life .It lasted about 1.5days even i used the hotspot for my work life the entire day. Second one is , it is very light inspite of having 6000mAh battery.Only mistake i found  is the placing of audio jack (it is on the bottom side) ,giving me trouble in handling the phone while using earphone.

Camera is best in this price range...... Fingerprint must improve...... And the main thing is battery.... It has a 6000mah battery...... it is just good.... And not excellent....... Because i to be honest...... i expected more about battery backup...... Because of the YouTube reviews..... But I am slightly disappointed...... It comes to around 1 day not 2 days....

I am absolutely  happy  with my decision  of buying  this Samsung M21 phone . I wanted a phone with good battery life . I charge once in two days if I use it more or once in 3 days . Camera quality  is so good which I actually  did not expect  .And touch sense is so smooth ...All in all a very good phone ... must say a tough competitor for phones of 40k or 50 k

My device is having issues, the wide angle camera is dirty from inside and the condition is worsening.
Tried talking to Amazon and no relief.
The device also has battery issues, and 48mp camera is not adequate.

Finger print reader is good and sensitive . Now getting battery life up to 1.5 days after full charge and the fast charger  is also good
Only negative I felt is the length  of USB cable not even 1 meters.  Not providing  head set so can include 1 meter cable for charger which is convenient. This I felt after one week of use

I bought it 10 days back and I'm really satisfied with it's performance. The battery is everlasting and the fast charging option is cherry on top. No lagging in games;good processor; Device doesn't get heated even after playing for 2 hours straight. Front and rear camera is outstanding. If you're looking for a phone under 15k this might be your best choice.

Overall nice smartphone at this price. Delivers awesome camera quality in both light and dark. Superb display thanks to samoled. But takes about 3 hrs to full charge which is a major drawback and drains faster as normal 3500 mAH battery.It must have some fast charging support such as vivo dual engine .
It's allrounder smartphone at budget friendly rate.

In one word this would definitely called as an "HD Monster" the screen quality is the best one. Coming to camera, the front was little disappointing, thought it would give an amazing pic but the back camera was awesome. Overall when camera kept aside this is the best mobile ever with cheap price üëå

Pros-
Awesome product.
Value for money.
Great battery life.
Awesome screen quality.

Cons-
Heats up quickly.
Back cover gets scratches so order back cover as well while purchasing.
You will get some pre-installed apps like Netflix, Outlook which cannot be uninstalled

Samsung Galaxy M21 is a good looking phone in a affordable price. Its fingerprint reader quality is best. And Also the battery life of this phone is longer than other phone. Because of 6000 mh battery power. Camera quality is also good. But i think Samsung need to work more on the backside of phone. Over all this is a good looking phone in this price.

Samsung made a good product that worth the money. Design is really good,battery life is surprising, RAM and  internal memory is good, graphics is good, more features are included in M21.
bt in case of camera it shows 48mp but image doesn't has that much quality. And samsung says its a fast charging model bt its an absolute lie.
